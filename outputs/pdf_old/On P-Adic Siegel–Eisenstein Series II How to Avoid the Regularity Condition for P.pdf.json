  "title": "On P-Adic Siegel\u2013Eisenstein Series II How to Avoid the Regularity Condition for P.pdf",
  "abstract": "In a previous paper, the authors showed that two kinds of p-adic Siegel\u2013 Eisenstein series of degree n coincide with classical modular forms of weight k for \u03930(p), under the assumption that p is a regular prime. The purpose of this paper is to show that this condition on p can be removed if the degree n is low compared with k, namely, n \u22642k + 1. 1 Introduction Nagaoka [8] and Katsurada\u2013Nagaoka [6] considered p-adic limits of Siegel Eisenstein series for arbitrary degree n, starting from \u201cinitial weight\u201d k being 1 and 2 respec- tively. They showed that these limits become classical Siegel modular forms for \u03930(p), more precisely they were identi\ufb01ed with certain linear combinations of genus theta series. It was later noticed [7] that in their work a condition \u201cp regular\u201d had to be imposed if n is large, but the result remained valid unconditionally for small n. Using a di\ufb00erent technique (mod pm singular modular forms and their structure) we recently proved such a result for arbitrary k for regular primes p. We emphasize that this condition on p was needed for all n (including the case of small n). The purpose of the present note is to show that by using some ingredients from [3, 2] (but not the full strength of the structure theorem there) we can also get rid of the p-regularity condition if n is not too large compared with k (i.e., n \u22642k + 1). 1"
