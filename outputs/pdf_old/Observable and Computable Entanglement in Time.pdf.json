  "abstract": "Our def- initions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and exe- cute them on the IBM quantum device ibm sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field the- ories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy. I. INTRODUCTION Entanglement is a key property of quantum mechanics. Its applications range from classifying topological phases [1] to quantifying the black hole information paradox [2]. However, entanglement is a property of a given state; it is not sensitive to what happened to the system in the past. Generalizing the notion of entanglement to include information about time evolution could open a new win- dow into probing the dynamics of quantum systems with many potential applications. Guided by relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), where space and time are intimately related, we pro- pose a definition of \u201centanglement in time\u201d applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. Central to our construction is a generalization of the density matrix suited for characterizing the properties of timelike sep- arated subsystems. We prove various properties of our \u201ctimelike density matrix\u201d which are analogous to prop- erties of the conventional \u201cspacelike\u201d density matrix. To illustrate the utility of our construction, we use it to derive upper and lower bounds on dynamical (Wight- man) correlation functions. We show that a certain mea- sure of entanglement in time for two subsystems, which we call the entanglement imagitivity, is nonzero if and only if one subsystem can influence the other at a later time. We also provide experimentally feasible protocols for measuring entanglement in time. II. DEFINING ENTANGLEMENT IN TIME To motivate our construction, consider in an RQFT the von Neumann entanglement entropy \u2212Tr \u03c1AB log \u03c1AB or Tsallis entropy Tr(\u03c1n AB) (exponentiated R\u00b4enyi entropy) of two spatially separated regions A and B; see Figure 1 (a). These are analytic functions (possibly with poles and branch-cuts) of spacetime coordinates defining A and B, \u2217milekhin@caltech.edu Figure 1. (a) Here A, B are spacelike separated. There are many existing tools in RQFT to compute Tr \u03c1n AB. (b) Time- like separated A, B. In RQFT this configuration can be con- tinuously deformed to (a). which are explicitly known in some cases. Now we can ask: if we analytically continue the answer for Tr(\u03c1n AB) from spacelike separation to timelike separation as in Fig- ure 1(b), can we give it any quantum-mechanical inter- pretation? For example, in a (1+1)-dimensional confor- mal field theory (CFT), the aforementioned analytic con- tinuation simply means computing time-separated corre- lation functions of twist operators. Can we still represent the answer as a trace over a certain Hilbert space, i.e. Tr T n AB, where TAB is an analogue of the density matrix that can be defined when A and B are timelike separated regions? Note that A and B do not need to be the same size or related to each other in any particular way. To construct TAB for any system, not necessarily an RQFT, and to provide a useful perspective on it, re- call the relation between density matrices and correlation functions. A basic rule of quantum mechanics is that the expectation value of observable O in a state with density matrix \u03c1 is given by \u27e8O\u27e9= Tr(O\u03c1). (1) Suppose we bipartition our quantum system into a sub- system A and its complement A. We can represent an expectation value of an operator OA supported on A as the contraction (2) arXiv:2502.12240v1 [quant-ph] 17 Feb 2025"
