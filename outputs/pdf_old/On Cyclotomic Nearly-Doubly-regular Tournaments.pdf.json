  "abstract": "Nearly-doubly-regular tournaments have played signi\ufb01cant roles in extremal graph theory. In this note, we determine all possible cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and their spec- trum. Furthermore, under the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F in analytic number the- ory, our results con\ufb01rm the conjecture due to Sergey Savchenko (J. Graph Theory 83 (2016), 44\u201377) on the existence of in\ufb01nitely many nearly-doubly-regular tournaments with the canonical spectrum. 1 Introduction A tournament is an orientation of a complete graph. A tournament with n vertices is said to be regular if n is odd and out-degree of each vertex is (n \u22121)/2. For even n, a tournament with n vertices is said to be near-regular if out-degree of each vertex is equal to n/2 or n/2 \u22121. A regular tournament with n vertices is a doubly-regular tournament, denoted by DRn, if n \u22613 (mod 4) and in- and out-neighbors of each vertex induce regular tournaments. Similarly, a regular tournament with n vertices is a nearly- doubly-regular tournament, denoted by NDRn, if n \u22611 (mod 4) and in- and out-neighbors of each vertex induce near-regular tournaments. Doubly-regular and near-doubly-regular tournaments play key roles in many branches of extremal graph theory such as the counting problem for cycles of a given length in tournaments (see e.g. [1], [4], [8], [11], [19], [20], [21], [22]). Indeed it is known that those minimizes the number of 4-cycles and maximizes the number of 5-cycles among regular tournaments ( [1], [19]). Furthermore, combining Theorem 5 in [1] and Theorem 1 in [6], it is readily seen that these tournaments posses quasi-randomness (see also [14], [17], [18]). Hence constructing doubly-regular or nearly-doubly-regular tournaments is an interesting but challenging open problem. In particular, there is only few known constructions for nearly-doubly-regular tournaments while more constructions are known for doubly-regular tournaments (see e.g. [25], [17]). In this note, we focus on cyclotomic tournaments introduced by Asti\u00b4e-Vidal [2]. For a prime power q, let Fq denote the \ufb01nite \ufb01eld of order q and let F+ q and F\u2217 q = Fq \\ {0} be the additive and multiplicative groups of Fq, respectively. Let g be a primitive element of Fq, that is, a generator of F\u2217 q and C(2\u2113) 0 denote the subgroup of F\u2217 q of index 2\u2113. If q \u22121 = 2\u2113m, where \u2113\u22651 and m is odd, then the cyclotomic tournament CTq with q vertices is de\ufb01ned as the tournament with vertex set Fq in which there exists an arc from x to y if and only if x \u2212y \u2208C(2\u2113) 0 \u222agC(2\u2113) 0 \u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222ag2\u2113\u22121\u22121C(2\u2113) 0 . This is well-de\ufb01ned since (D, \u2212D) is a partition of F\u2217 q where D = C(2\u2113) 0 \u222agC(2\u2113) 0 \u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222ag2\u2113\u22121\u22121C(2\u2113) 0 and \u2212D = {\u2212d | d \u2208D}. Note that if \u2113= 1, or equivalently, q \u22613 (mod 4), then CTq is exactly the Paley tournament (a.k.a. quadratic residue tournament) with q vertices. On the other hand, it has been conjectured ( [3], [19]) that there exist in\ufb01nitely many primes p \u22615 (mod 8) such that CTp is nearly-doubly-regular while the authors of [3] and [24] veri\ufb01ed that CTp is nearly-doubly-regular when p = 5, 13, 29, 53, 173, 229, 293, 733 by computer search. \u2217Research and Education Institute for Semiconductors and Informatics, Kumamoto University 2-39-1, Kurokami, Chuo, Kumamoto, 860-8555, Japan.
