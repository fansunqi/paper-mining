  "abstract": "A graph is rigid if it only admits the identity endomorphism. We show that for every d \u22653 there exist infinitely many mutually rigid d-regular graphs of arbitrary odd girth g \u22657. Moreover, we determine the minimum order of a rigid d-regular graph for every d \u22653. This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/ 321108]. Further, we use our construction to show that every finite monoid is iso- morphic to the endomorphism monoid of a regular graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B, 1980]. Mathematics Subject Classifications: 05C25,20M30,05C75,05C60 Keywords: graph endomorphisms, monoids, rigidity, regular graphs 1 Introduction All graphs, groups, and monoids are considered to be finite. Frucht [8] shows that every group is isomorphic to the automorphism group Aut(G) of a graph G. Later, Hedrl\u00b4\u0131n and Pultr [13,14] show that every monoid M is isomorphic to the endomorphism monoid End(G) of a graph G. It is a natural and well-studied question what further assumptions can be made about G, while maintaining the above theorems valid, see the introduction of [20]. Here, we focus on G being regular. It is another classic result of Frucht [9] that every group is isomorphic to the automor- phism group Aut(G) of a 3-regular graph G (even of a Hamiltonian 3-regular G, see [3]). Soon after, Sabidussi [27] showed that every group is isomorphic to the automorphism group Aut(G) of a d-regular graph G for every d \u22653. In particular, this applies to the trivial group {e}, i.e., there are d-regular asymmetric graphs for every d \u22653. Izbicki [19] shows that for every d \u22653 there exist infinitely many d-regular asymmetric graphs and Baron and Imrich [5] completely determine the function \u00b5(d) that assigns to every d \u22653 the smallest order of an asymmetric d-regular graph.
