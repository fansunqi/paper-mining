  "abstract": "  We present a neural extension of basic shadow mapping for fast, high quality hard and soft shadows. We compare favorably to fast pre-filtering shadow mapping, all while producing visual results on par with ray traced hard and soft shadows. We show that combining memory bandwidth-aware architecture specialization and careful temporal-window training leads to a fast, compact and easy-to-train neural shadowing method. Our technique is memory bandwidth conscious, eliminates the need for post-process temporal anti-aliasing or denoising, and supports scenes with dynamic view, emitters and geometry while remaining robust to unseen objects.
