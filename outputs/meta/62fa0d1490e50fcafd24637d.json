  "title": "Probabilistic Variational Causal Effect as A new Theory for Causal\n  Reasoning",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a new causal framework capable of dealing with probabilistic and non-probabilistic problems. Indeed, we provide a direct causal effect formula called Probabilistic vAriational Causal Effect (PACE) and its variations satisfying some ideas and postulates. Our formula of causal effect uses the idea of the total variation of a function integrated with probability theory. The probabilistic part is the natural availability of changing an exposure values given some variables. These variables interfere with the effect of the exposure on a given outcome. PACE has a parameter $d$ determining the degree of considering the natural availability of changing the exposure values. The lower values of $d$ refer to the scenarios for which rare cases are important. In contrast, with the higher values of $d$, our framework deals with the problems that are in nature probabilistic. Hence, instead of a single value for causal effect, we provide a causal effect vector by discretizing $d$. Further, we introduce the positive and negative PACE to measure the positive and the negative causal changes in the outcome while changing the exposure values. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability criterion for PACE to deal with observational studies. We also address the problem of computing counterfactuals in causal reasoning. We compare our framework to the Pearl, the mutual information, the conditional mutual information, and the Janzing et al. frameworks by investigating several examples. "
