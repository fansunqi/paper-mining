  "title": "Fairness in Participatory Budgeting via Equality of Resources",
  "abstract": "  We introduce a family of normative principles to assess fairness in the context of participatory budgeting. These principles are based on the fundamental idea that budget allocations should be fair in terms of the resources invested into meeting the wishes of individual voters. This is in contrast to earlier proposals that are based on specific assumptions regarding the satisfaction of voters with a given budget allocation. We analyse these new principles in axiomatic, algorithmic, and experimental terms. "
