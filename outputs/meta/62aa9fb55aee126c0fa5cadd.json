  "title": "Sparse Subspace Clustering in Diverse Multiplex Network Model",
  "abstract": "  The paper considers the DIverse MultiPLEx (DIMPLE) network model, introduced in Pensky and Wang (2021), where all layers of the network have the same collection of nodes and are equipped with the Stochastic Block Models. In addition, all layers can be partitioned into groups with the same community structures, although the layers in the same group may have different matrices of block connection probabilities. The DIMPLE model generalizes a multitude of papers that study multilayer networks with the same community structures in all layers, as well as the Mixture Multilayer Stochastic Block Model (MMLSBM), where the layers in the same group have identical matrices of block connection probabilities. While Pensky and Wang (2021) applied spectral clustering to the proxy of the adjacency tensor, the present paper uses Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) for identifying groups of layers with identical community structures. Under mild conditions, the latter leads to the strongly consistent between-layer clustering. In addition, SSC allows to handle much larger networks than methodology of Pensky and Wang (2021), and is perfectly suitable for application of parallel computing. "
