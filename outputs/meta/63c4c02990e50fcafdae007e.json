  "title": "An RTL Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES)",
  "abstract": "  Data Encryption Standard (DES) is based on the Feistel block cipher, developed in 1971 by IBM cryptography researcher Horst Feistel. DES uses 16 rounds of the Feistel structure. But with the changes in recent years, the internet is starting to be used more to connect devices to each other. These devices can range from powerful computing devices, such as desktop computers and tablets, to resource constrained devices, When it comes to these constrained devices, using a different key for each round cryptography algorithms fail to provide necessary security and performance.
