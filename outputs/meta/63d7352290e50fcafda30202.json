  "title": "Estimating Causal Effects using a Multi-task Deep Ensemble",
  "abstract": "  Over the past few decades, a number of methods have been proposed for causal effect estimation, yet few have been demonstrated to be effective in handling data with complex structures, such as images. To fill this gap, we propose a Causal Multi-task Deep Ensemble (CMDE) framework to learn both shared and group-specific information from the study population and prove its equivalence to a multi-task Gaussian process (GP) with coregionalization kernel a priori. Compared to multi-task GP, CMDE efficiently handles high-dimensional and multi-modal covariates and provides pointwise uncertainty estimates of causal effects. We evaluate our method across various types of datasets and tasks and find that CMDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a majority of these tasks. "
