  "title": "Network Sparsification via Degree- and Subgraph-based Edge Sampling",
  "abstract": "  Network (or graph) sparsification compresses a graph by removing inessential edges. By reducing the data volume, it accelerates or even facilitates many downstream analyses. Still, the accuracy of many sparsification methods, with filtering-based edge sampling being the most typical one, heavily relies on an appropriate definition of edge importance. Instead, we propose a different perspective with a generalized local-property-based sampling method, which preserves (scaled) local \\emph{node} characteristics. Apart from degrees, these local node characteristics we use are the expected (scaled) number of wedges and triangles a node belongs to. Through such a preservation, main complex structural properties are preserved implicitly. We adapt a game-theoretic framework from uncertain graph sampling by including a threshold for faster convergence (at least $4$ times faster empirically) to approximate solutions. Extensive experimental studies on functional climate networks show the effectiveness of this method in preserving macroscopic to mesoscopic and microscopic network structural properties. "
