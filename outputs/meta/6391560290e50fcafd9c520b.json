  "abstract": "  A frequency $n$-cube $F^n(q;l_0,...,l_{m-1})$ is an $n$-dimensional $q$-by-...-by-$q$ array, where $q = l_0+...+l_{m-1}$, filled by numbers $0,...,m-1$ with the property that each line contains exactly $l_i$ cells with symbol $i$, $i = 0,...,m-1$ (a line consists of $q$ cells of the array differing in one coordinate). The trivial upper bound on the number of frequency $n$-cubes is $m^{(q-1)^{n}}$. We improve that lower bound for $n>2$, replacing $q-1$ by a smaller value, by constructing a testing set of size $s^{n}$, $s<q-1$, for frequency $n$-cubes (a testing sets is a collection of cells of an array the values in which uniquely determine the array with given parameters). We also construct new testing sets for generalized frequency $n$-cubes, which are essentially correlation-immune functions in $n$ $q$-valued arguments; the cardinalities of new testing sets are smaller than for testing sets known before.   Keywords: frequency hypercube, correlation-immune function, latin hypercube, testing set. "
