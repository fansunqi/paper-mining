  "title": "Multimodal Dyadic Impression Recognition via Listener Adaptive\n  Cross-Domain Fusion",
  "abstract": "  As a sub-branch of affective computing, impression recognition, e.g., perception of speaker characteristics such as warmth or competence, is potentially a critical part of both human-human conversations and spoken dialogue systems. Most research has studied impressions only from the behaviors expressed by the speaker or the response from the listener, yet ignored their latent connection. In this paper, we perform impression recognition using a proposed listener adaptive cross-domain architecture, which consists of a listener adaptation function to model the causality between speaker and listener behaviors and a cross-domain fusion function to strengthen their connection. The experimental evaluation on the dyadic IMPRESSION dataset verified the efficacy of our method, producing concordance correlation coefficients of 78.8% and 77.5% in the competence and warmth dimensions, outperforming previous studies. The proposed method is expected to be generalized to similar dyadic interaction scenarios. "
