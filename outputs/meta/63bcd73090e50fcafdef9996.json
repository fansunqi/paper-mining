  "abstract": "  Given $X_1,\\cdot ,X_N$ random variables whose joint distribution is given as $\\mu$ we will use the Martingale Method to show any Lipshitz Function $f$ over these random variables is subgaussian. The Variance parameter however can have a simple expression under certain conditions. For example under the assumption that the random variables follow a Markov Chain and that the function is Lipschitz under a Weighted Hamming Metric. We shall conclude with certain well known techniques from concentration of suprema of random processes with applications in Reinforcement Learning "
