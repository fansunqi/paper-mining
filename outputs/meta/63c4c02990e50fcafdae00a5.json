  "abstract": "  In this study, we propose a new method for combining in situ buoy measurements with Earth system models (ESMs) to improve the accuracy of temperature predictions in the ocean. The technique utilizes the dynamics and modes identified in ESMs to improve the accuracy of buoy measurements while still preserving features such as seasonality. Using this technique, errors in localized temperature predictions made by the MPAS-O model can be corrected. We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy compared to other interpolation and data assimilation methods. We apply our method to assimilate the Model for Prediction Across Scales Ocean component (MPAS-O) with the Global Drifter Program's in-situ ocean buoy dataset. "
