  "title": "Image Protection for Robust Cropping Localization and Recovery",
  "abstract": "  Existing image cropping detection schemes ignore that recovering the cropped-out contents can unveil the purpose of the behaved cropping attack. This paper presents \\textbf{CLR}-Net, a novel image protection scheme addressing the combined challenge of image \\textbf{C}ropping \\textbf{L}ocalization and \\textbf{R}ecovery. We first protect the original image by introducing imperceptible perturbations. Then, typical image post-processing attacks are simulated to erode the protected image. On the recipient's side, we predict the cropping mask and recover the original image. Besides, we propose a novel \\textbf{F}ine-\\textbf{G}rained generative \\textbf{JPEG} simulator (FG-JPEG) as well as a feature alignment network to improve the real-world robustness. Comprehensive experiments prove that the quality of the recovered image and the accuracy of crop localization are both satisfactory. "
