  "abstract": "  Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has recently gained increasing interest in computational mechanics. In this work, we present a detailed introduction to programming PINN-based computational solid mechanics. Besides, two prevailingly used physics-informed loss functions for PINN-based computational solid mechanics are summarised. Moreover, numerical examples ranging from 1D to 3D solid problems are presented to show the performance of PINN-based computational solid mechanics. The programs are built via Python coding language and TensorFlow library with step-by-step explanations. It is worth highlighting that PINN-based computational mechanics is easy to implement and can be extended for more challenging applications. This work aims to help the researchers who are interested in the PINN-based solid mechanics solver to have a clear insight into this emerging area. The programs for all the numerical examples presented in this work are available on https://github.com/JinshuaiBai/PINN_Comp_Mech. "
