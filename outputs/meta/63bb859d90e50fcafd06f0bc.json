  "title": "On the Width of the Regular $n$-Simplex",
  "abstract": "  Consider the regular $n$-simplex $\\Delta_n$ - it is formed by the convex-hull of $n+1$ points in Euclidean space, with each pair of points being in distance exactly one from each other. We prove an exact bound on the width of $\\Delta_n$ which is $\\approx \\sqrt{2/n}$. Specifically, $ \\mathrm{width}(\\Delta_n) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n + 1}}$ if $n$ is odd, and $ \\mathrm{width}(\\Delta_n) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(n+1)}{n(n+2)}} $ if $n$ is even. While this bound is well known [GK92, Ale77], we provide a self-contained elementary proof that might (or might not) be of interest. "
