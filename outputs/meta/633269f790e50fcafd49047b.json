  "abstract": "  Cooperative sensing and heterogeneous information fusion are critical to realize vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs). This paper makes the first attempt to quantitatively measure the quality of VCPS by designing a new metric called Age of View (AoV). Specifically, we first present the system architecture where heterogeneous information can be cooperatively sensed and uploaded via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in vehicular edge computing (VEC). Logical views are constructed by fusing the heterogeneous information at edge nodes. Further, we formulate the problem by deriving a cooperative sensing model based on the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue, and defining the AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness and consistency of the logical views. On this basis, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solution is proposed. In particular, the system state includes vehicle sensed information, edge cached information and view requirements. The vehicle action space consists of the sensing frequencies and uploading priorities of information. A difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed to divide the system reward, which is defined as the VCPS quality, into the difference reward for vehicles. Edge node allocates V2I bandwidth to vehicles based on predicted vehicle trajectories and view requirements. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution. "
