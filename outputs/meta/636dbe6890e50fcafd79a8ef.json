  "title": "Multistatic Sensing of Passive Targets Using 6G Cellular Infrastructure",
  "abstract": "  Sensing using cellular infrastructure may be one of the defining feature of sixth generation (6G) wireless systems. Wideband 6G communication channels operating at higher frequency bands (upper mmWave bands) are better modeled using clustered geometric channel models. In this paper, we propose methods for detection of passive targets and estimating their position using communication deployment without any assistance from the target. A novel AI architecture called CsiSenseNet is developed for this purpose. We analyze the resolution, coverage and position uncertainty for practical indoor deployments. Using the proposed method, we show that human sized target can be sensed with high accuracy and sub-meter positioning errors in a practical indoor deployment scenario. "
