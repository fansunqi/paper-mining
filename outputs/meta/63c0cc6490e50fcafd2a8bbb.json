  "title": "Color-NeuraCrypt: Privacy-Preserving Color-Image Classification Using\n  Extended Random Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "  In recent years, with the development of cloud computing platforms, privacy-preserving methods for deep learning have become an urgent problem. NeuraCrypt is a private random neural network for privacy-preserving that allows data owners to encrypt the medical data before the data uploading, and data owners can train and then test their models in a cloud server with the encrypted data directly. However, we point out that the performance of NeuraCrypt is heavily degraded when using color images. In this paper, we propose a Color-NeuraCrypt to solve this problem. Experiment results show that our proposed Color-NeuraCrypt can achieve a better classification accuracy than the original one and other privacy-preserving methods. "
