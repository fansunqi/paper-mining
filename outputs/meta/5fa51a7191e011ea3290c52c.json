  "abstract": "  We present a High-Level Python-based Hardware Description Language (HDPython), It uses Python as its source language and converts it to standard VHDL. Compared to other approaches of building converters from a high-level programming language into a hardware description language, this new approach aims to maintain an object-oriented paradigm throughout the entire process. Instead of removing all the high-level features from Python to make it into an HDL, this approach goes the opposite way. It tries to show how certain features from a high-level language can be implemented in an HDL, providing the corresponding benefits of high-level programming for the user. "
