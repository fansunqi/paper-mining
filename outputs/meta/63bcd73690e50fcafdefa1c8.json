  "title": "Line-Torus Intersection for Ray Tracing: Alternative Formulations",
  "abstract": "  Intersection algorithms are very important in computation of geometrical problems. Algorithms for a line intersection with linear or quadratic surfaces are quite efficient. However, algorithms for a line intersection with other surfaces are more complex and time consuming. In this case the object is usually closed into a simple bounding volume to speed up the cases when the given line cannot intersect the given object. In this paper new formulations of the line-torus intersection problem are given and new specification of the bounding volume for a torus is given as well. The presented approach is based on an idea of a line intersection with an envelope of rotating sphere that forms a torus. Due to this approach new bounding volume can be formulated which is more effective as it enables to detect cases when the line passes the \"hole\" of a torus, too. "
