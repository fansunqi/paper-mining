  "title": "Cryptographic Group and Semigroup Actions",
  "abstract": "  We consider actions of a group or a semigroup on a set, which generalize the setup of discrete logarithm based cryptosystems. Such cryptographic group actions have gained increasing attention recently in the context of isogeny-based cryptography. We introduce generic algorithms for the semigroup action problem and discuss lower and upper bounds. Also, we investigate Pohlig-Hellman type attacks in a general sense. In particular, we consider reductions provided by non-invertible elements in a semigroup, and we deal with subgroups in the case of group actions. "
