  "title": "Cell-Free Massive MIMO in O-RAN: Energy-Aware Joint Orchestration of\n  Cloud, Fronthaul, and Radio Resources",
  "abstract": "For the energy-efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO functionality\nin a practical wireless network, the end-to-end (from radio site to the cloud)\nenergy-aware operation is essential. In line with the cloudification and\nvirtualization in the open radio access networks (O-RAN), it is indisputable to\nenvision prospective cell-free infrastructure on top of the O-RAN architecture.\nIn this paper, we explore the performance and power consumption of cell-free\nmassive MIMO technology in comparison with traditional small-cell systems, in\nthe virtualized O-RAN architecture. We compare two different functional split\noptions and different resource orchestration mechanisms. In the end-to-end\norchestration scheme, we aim to minimize the end-to-end power consumption by\njointly allocating the radio, optical fronthaul, and virtualized cloud\nprocessing resources. We compare end-to-end orchestration with two other\nschemes: i) \"radio-only\" where radio resources are optimized independently from\nthe cloud and ii) \"local cloud coordination\" where orchestration is only\nallowed among a local cluster of radio units. We develop several algorithms to\nsolve the end-to-end power minimization and sum spectral efficiency\nmaximization problems. The numerical results demonstrate that end-to-end\nresource allocation with fully virtualized fronthaul and cloud resources\nprovides a substantial additional power saving than the other resource\norchestration schemes."
