  "abstract": "  The advances in deep learning have enabled machine learning methods to outperform human beings in various areas, but it remains a great challenge for a well-trained model to quickly adapt to a new task. One promising solution to realize this goal is through meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, which has achieved promising results in few-shot learning. However, current approaches are still enormously different from human beings' learning process, especially in the ability to extract structural and transferable knowledge. This drawback makes current meta-learning frameworks non-interpretable and hard to extend to more complex tasks. We tackle this problem by introducing concept discovery to the few-shot learning problem, where we achieve more effective adaptation by meta-learning the structure among the data features, leading to a composite representation of the data. Our proposed method Concept-Based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (COMAML) has been shown to achieve consistent improvements in the structured data for both synthesized datasets and real-world datasets.
