  "title": "Novel Intensity Mapping Functions: Weighted Histogram Averaging",
  "abstract": "  It is challenging to align the brightness distribution of the images with different exposures due to possible color distortion and loss of details in the brightest and darkest regions of input images. In this paper, a novel intensity mapping algorithm is first proposed by introducing a new concept of weighted histogram averaging (WHA). The proposed WHA algorithm leverages the correspondence between the histogram bins of two images which are built up by using the non-decreasing property of the intensity mapping functions (IMFs). Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed WHA algorithm significantly surpasses the related state-of-the-art intensity mapping methods. "
