  "abstract": "This paper proposes an adaptive graph-based approach for multi-label image\nclassification. Graph-based methods have been largely exploited in the field of\nmulti-label classification, given their ability to model label correlations.\nSpecifically, their effectiveness has been proven not only when considering a\nsingle domain but also when taking into account multiple domains. However, the\ntopology of the used graph is not optimal as it is pre-defined heuristically.\nIn addition, consecutive Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) aggregations tend to\ndestroy the feature similarity. To overcome these issues, an architecture for\nlearning the graph connectivity in an end-to-end fashion is introduced. This is\ndone by integrating an attention-based mechanism and a similarity-preserving\nstrategy. The proposed framework is then extended to multiple domains using an\nadversarial training scheme. Numerous experiments are reported on well-known\nsingle-domain and multi-domain benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our\napproach achieves competitive results in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP)\nand model size as compared to the state-of-the-art. The code will be made\npublicly available."
