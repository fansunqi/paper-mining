  "title": "A Tractable Probability Distribution with Applications in\n  Three-Dimensional Statistics",
  "abstract": "  A new family of continuous probability distributions is presented in this paper that has applications in norm distributions of three-dimensional random spaces. The distribution is defined on the semi-infinite interval [0,$\\infty$) and exhibits remarkable computational tractability, making it highly appealing for various applications. "
