  "abstract": "  In recent years, distributional language representation models have demonstrated great practical success. At the same time, the need for interpretability has elicited questions on their intrinsic properties and capabilities. Crucially, distributional models are often inconsistent when dealing with compositional phenomena in natural language, which has significant implications for their safety and fairness. Despite this, most current research on compositionality is directed towards improving their performance on similarity tasks only. This work takes a different approach, and proposes a methodology for measuring compositional behavior in contemporary language models. Specifically, we focus on adjectival modifier phenomena in adjective-noun phrases. We introduce three novel tests of compositional behavior inspired by Montague semantics. Our experimental results indicate that current neural language models behave according to the expected linguistic theories to a limited extent only. This raises the question of whether these language models are not able to capture the semantic properties we evaluated, or whether linguistic theories from Montagovian tradition would not match the expected capabilities of distributional models.
