  "abstract": "  Unsupervised machine learning applied to the study of phase transitions is an ongoing and interesting research direction. The active contour model, also called the snake model, was initially proposed for target contour extraction in two-dimensional images. In order to obtain a physical phase diagram, the snake model with an artificial neural network is applied in an unsupervised learning way by the authors of [Phys.Rev.Lett. 120, 176401(2018)]. It guesses the phase boundary as an initial snake and then drives the snake to convergence with forces estimated by the artificial neural network. In this paper, we extend this unsupervised learning method with one contour to a snake net with multiple contours for the purpose of obtaining several phase boundaries in a phase diagram. For the classical Blume-Capel model, the phase diagram containing three and four phases is obtained. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of the initial position and speed up the movement of the snake, the balloon force decaying with the iteration steps is introduced and applied to the snake net structure. Our method is helpful in determining the phase diagram with multiple phases, using just snapshots of configurations from cold atoms or other experiments without knowledge of the phases. "
