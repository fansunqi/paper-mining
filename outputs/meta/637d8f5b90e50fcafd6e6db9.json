  "abstract": "  In 2009, Ghani, Hancock and Pattinson gave a tree-like representation of stream processors $A^{\\mathbb{N}} \\rightarrow B^{\\mathbb{N}}$. In 2021, Garner showed that this representation can be established in terms of algebraic theory and comodels: the set of infinite streams $A^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is the final comodel of the algebraic theory of $A$-valued input $\\mathbb{T}_A$ and the set of stream processors $\\mathit{Top}(A^{\\mathbb{N}},B^{\\mathbb{N}})$ can be seen as the final $\\mathbb{T}_A$-$\\mathbb{T}_B$-bimodel. In this paper, we generalize Garner's results to the case of free algebraic theories. "
