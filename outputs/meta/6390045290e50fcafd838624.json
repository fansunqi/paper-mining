  "abstract": "  Cities are continuously evolving human settlements. Our cities are under strain in an increasingly urbanized world, and planners, decision-makers, and communities must be ready to adapt. Data is an important resource for municipal administration. Some technologies aid in the collection, processing, and visualization of urban data, assisting in the interpretation and comprehension of how urban systems operate. The relationship between data analytics and smart cities has come to light in recent years as interest in both has grown. A sophisticated network of interconnected systems, including planners and inhabitants, is what is known as a smart city. Data analysis has the potential to support data-driven decision-making in the context of smart cities. Both urban managers and residents are becoming more interested in city dashboards. Dashboards may collect, display, analyze, and provide information on regional performance to help smart cities development have sustainability. In order to assist decision-making processes and enhance the performance of cities, we examine how dashboards might be used to acquire accurate and representative information regarding urban challenges. This chapter culminates Data Analytics on key indicators for the city's urban services and dashboards for leadership and decision-making. A single web page with consolidated information, real-time data streams pertinent to planners and decision-makers as well as residents' everyday lives, and site analytics as a method to assess user interactions and preferences are among the proposals for urban dashboards.   Keywords: -Dashboard, data analytics, smart city, sustainability, Smart cities, City dashboards, Urban services, Decision-making, Interconnected systems, Real-time data streams, Key indicators, and Urban challenges.
