  "abstract": "  Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) has rapidly progressed in recent years. Existing works tend to design a single tracking algorithm to perform both detection and association. Though ensemble learning has been exploited in many tasks, i.e, classification and object detection, it hasn't been studied in the MOT task, which is mainly caused by its complexity and evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective ensemble method for MOT, called EnsembleMOT, which merges multiple tracking results from various trackers with spatio-temporal constraints. Meanwhile, several post-processing procedures are applied to filter out abnormal results. Our method is model-independent and doesn't need the learning procedure. What's more, it can easily work in conjunction with other algorithms, e.g., tracklets interpolation. Experiments on the MOT17 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
