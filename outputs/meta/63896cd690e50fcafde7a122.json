  "abstract": "  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm with an added advantage of data privacy. With the growing interest in having collaboration among data owners, FL has gained significant attention of organizations. The idea of FL is to enable collaborating participants train machine learning (ML) models on decentralized data without breaching privacy. In simpler words, federated learning is the approach of ``bringing the model to the data, instead of bringing the data to the mode''. Federated learning, when applied to data which is partitioned vertically across participants, is able to build a complete ML model by combining local models trained only using the data with distinct features at the local sites. This architecture of FL is referred to as vertical federated learning (VFL), which differs from the conventional FL on horizontally partitioned data. As VFL is different from conventional FL, it comes with its own issues and challenges. In this paper, we present a structured literature review discussing the state-of-the-art approaches in VFL. Additionally, the literature review highlights the existing solutions to challenges in VFL and provides potential research directions in this domain. "
