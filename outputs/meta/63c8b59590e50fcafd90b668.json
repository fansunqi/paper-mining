  "title": "FemtoDet: An Object Detection Baseline for Energy Versus Performance\n  Tradeoffs",
  "abstract": "  Efficient detectors for edge devices are often optimized for metrics like parameters or speed counts, which remain weak correlation with the energy of detectors. However, among vision applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), some, such as always-on surveillance cameras, are critical for energy constraints. This paper aims to serve as a baseline by designing detectors to reach tradeoffs between energy and performance from two perspectives: 1) We extensively analyze various CNNs to identify low-energy architectures, including the selection of activation functions, convolutions operators, and feature fusion structures on necks. These underappreciated details in past works seriously affect the energy consumption of detectors; 2) To break through the dilemmatic energy-performance problem, we propose a balanced detector driven by energy using discovered low-energy components named \\textit{FemtoDet}. In addition to the novel construction, we further improve FemtoDet by considering convolutions and training strategy optimizations. Specifically, we develop a new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module for convolution optimization to overcome the contradiction between the limited capacity of CNNs and detection tasks in diverse spatial representations, and propose a recursive warm-restart (RecWR) for optimizing training strategy to escape the sub-optimization of light-weight detectors, considering the data shift produced in popular augmentations. As a result, FemtoDet with only 68.77k parameters achieves a competitive score of 46.3 AP50 on PASCAL VOC and power of 7.83W on RTX 3090. Extensive experiments on COCO and TJU-DHD datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in diverse scenes. "
