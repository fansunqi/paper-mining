  "title": "User Centered Design (VII): From Automated Flight Deck to Intelligent\n  Flight Deck",
  "abstract": "  Driven by the \"user-centered design\" philosophy, this paper first outlines the human factors problems of the flight deck automation for large civil aircraft and the human factors research carried out based on the \"human-centered automation\" approach. This paper then reviews the previous initial human factors research on intelligent civil flight deck based on the \"human-centered AI\" approach and discusses the prospects for future human factors research. Based on our proposed human factors engineering model for intelligent human-computer interaction and the framework of joint cognitive eco-systems, this paper proposes an initial human factors solution for the single-pilot operations of large civil aircraft and presents preliminary suggestions for future human factors research.
