  "abstract": "  As stakeholders' pressure on corporates for disclosing their corporate social responsibility operations grows, it is crucial to understand how efficient corporate disclosure systems are in bridging the gap between corporate social responsibility reports and their actual practice. Meanwhile, research on corporate social responsibility is still not aligned with the recent data-driven strategies, and little public data are available. This paper aims to describe CSRCZ, a newly created dataset based on disclosure reports from the websites of 1000 companies that operate in Czech Republic. Each company was analyzed based on three main parameters: company size, company industry, and company initiatives. We describe the content of the dataset as well as its potential use for future research. We believe that CSRCZ has implications for further research, since it is the first publicly available dataset of its kind. "
