  "abstract": "  Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) allows a set of parties to securely compute a functionality in a distributed fashion without the need for any trusted external party. Usually, it is assumed that the parties know each other and have already established authenticated channels among each other. However, in practice the parties sometimes must stay anonymous. In this paper, we conceptualize a framework that enables the repeated execution of an SMPC protocol for a given functionality such that the parties can keep their participation in the protocol executions private and at the same time be sure that only authorized parties may take part in a protocol execution. We identify the security properties that an implementation of our framework must meet and introduce a first implementation of the framework that achieves these properties. "
