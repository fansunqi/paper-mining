  "title": "22 Examples of Solution Compression via Derandomization",
  "abstract": "  We provide bounds on the compression size of the solutions to 22 problems in computer science. For each problem, we show that solutions exist with high probability, for some simple probability measure. Once this is proven, derandomization can be used to prove the existence of a simple solution. "
