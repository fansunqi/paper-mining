  "abstract": "  Pre-trained language models are trained on large-scale unsupervised data, and they can fine-turn the model only on small-scale labeled datasets, and achieve good results. Multilingual pre-trained language models can be trained on multiple languages, and the model can understand multiple languages at the same time. At present, the search on pre-trained models mainly focuses on rich resources, while there is relatively little research on low-resource languages such as minority languages, and the public multilingual pre-trained language model can not work well for minority languages. Therefore, this paper constructs a multilingual pre-trained model named MiLMo that performs better on minority language tasks, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh and Korean. To solve the problem of scarcity of datasets on minority languages and verify the effectiveness of the MiLMo model, this paper constructs a minority multilingual text classification dataset named MiTC, and trains a word2vec model for each language. By comparing the word2vec model and the pre-trained model in the text classification task, this paper provides an optimal scheme for the downstream task research of minority languages. The final experimental results show that the performance of the pre-trained model is better than that of the word2vec model, and it has achieved the best results in minority multilingual text classification. The multilingual pre-trained model MiLMo, multilingual word2vec model and multilingual text classification dataset MiTC are published on http://milmo.cmli-nlp.com/. "
