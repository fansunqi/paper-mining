  "abstract": "  Quantum kernels are considered as potential resources to illustrate benefits of quantum computing in machine learning. Considering the impact of hyperparameters on the performance of a classical machine learning model, it is imperative to identify promising hyperparameters using quantum kernel methods in order to achieve quantum advantages. In this work, we analyse and classify sentiments of textual data using a new quantum kernel based on linear and full entangled circuits as hyperparameters for controlling the correlation among words. We also find that the use of linear and full entanglement further controls the expressivity of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM). In addition, we also compare the efficiency of the proposed circuit with other quantum circuits and classical machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed fully entangled circuit outperforms all other fully or linearly entangled circuits in addition to classical algorithms for most of the features. In fact, as the feature increases the efficiency of our proposed fully entangled model also increases significantly. "
