  "title": "Re-creation of Creations: A New Paradigm for Lyric-to-Melody Generation",
  "abstract": "  Lyric-to-melody generation is an important task in songwriting, and is also quite challenging due to its unique characteristics: the generated melodies should not only follow good musical patterns, but also align with features in lyrics such as rhythms and structures. These characteristics cannot be well handled by neural generation models that learn lyric-to-melody mapping in an end-to-end way, due to several issues: (1) lack of aligned lyric-melody training data to sufficiently learn lyric-melody feature alignment; (2) lack of controllability in generation to better and explicitly align the lyric-melody features. In this paper, we propose Re-creation of Creations (ROC), a new paradigm for lyric-to-melody generation. ROC generates melodies according to given lyrics and also conditions on user-designated chord progression. It addresses the above issues through a generation-retrieval pipeline. Specifically, our paradigm has two stages: (1) creation stage, where a huge amount of music fragments generated by a neural melody language model are indexed in a database through several key features (e.g., chords, tonality, rhythm, and structural information); (2) re-creation stage, where melodies are re-created by retrieving music fragments from the database according to the key features from lyrics and concatenating best music fragments based on composition guidelines and melody language model scores. ROC has several advantages: (1) It only needs unpaired melody data to train melody language model, instead of paired lyric-melody data in previous models. (2) It achieves good lyric-melody feature alignment in lyric-to-melody generation. Tested by English and Chinese lyrics, ROC outperforms previous neural based lyric-to-melody generation models on both objective and subjective metrics. "
