  "abstract": "  An effective exact method is proposed for computing generalized eigenspaces of a matrix of integers or rational numbers. Keys of our approach are the use of minimal annihilating polynomials and the concept of the Jourdan-Krylov basis. A new method, called Jordan-Krylov elimination, is introduced to design an algorithm for computing Jordan-Krylov basis. The resulting algorithm outputs generalized eigenspaces as a form of Jordan chains. Notably, in the output, components of generalized eigenvectors are expressed as polynomials in the associated eigenvalue as a variable. "
