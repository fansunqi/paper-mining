  "abstract": "  We propose a novel Branch-and-Bound method for reachability analysis of neural networks in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Our idea is to first compute accurate bounds on the Lipschitz constant of the neural network in certain directions of interest offline using a convex program. We then use these bounds to obtain an instantaneous but conservative polyhedral approximation of the reachable set using Lipschitz continuity arguments. To reduce conservatism, we incorporate our bounding algorithm within a branching strategy to decrease the over-approximation error within an arbitrary accuracy. We then extend our method to reachability analysis of control systems with neural network controllers. Finally, to capture the shape of the reachable sets as accurately as possible, we use sample trajectories to inform the directions of the reachable set over-approximations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in several open-loop and closed-loop settings. "
