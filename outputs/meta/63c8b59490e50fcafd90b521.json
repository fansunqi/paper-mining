  "abstract": "  Stroke is a medical condition that can affect motor function, particularly dynamic balance. Biofeedback can aid in rehabilitation procedures which help patients to regain lost motor activity and recover functionality. In this work, we are presenting a robotic smart-vest device that can analyze Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and assist in rehabilitation procedures by providing timed feedback in the form of vibrotactile stimulation. Information provided by principal caregivers and patients in the form of surveys and interviews, is used to hypothesize potential clinical causes and to derive alternative three alternative clinical modalities: Artificial Vestibular Feedback, Gait Pacemaker and Risk-Predictor.
