  "abstract": "  $d$-dimensional (for $d>1$) efficient range-summability ($d$D-ERS) of random variables (RVs) is a fundamental algorithmic problem that has applications to two important families of database problems, namely, fast approximate wavelet tracking (FAWT) on data streams and approximately answering range-sum queries over a data cube. Whether there are efficient solutions to the $d$D-ERS problem, or to the latter database problem, have been two long-standing open problems. Both are solved in this work. Specifically, we propose a novel solution framework to $d$D-ERS on RVs that have Gaussian or Poisson distribution. Our $d$D-ERS solutions are the first ones that have polylogarithmic time complexities. Furthermore, we develop a novel $k$-wise independence theory that allows our $d$D-ERS solutions to have both high computational efficiencies and strong provable independence guarantees. Finally, we show that under a sufficient and likely necessary condition, certain existing solutions for 1D-ERS can be generalized to higher dimensions. "
