  "abstract": "  In this paper, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for multi-twisted Reed-Solomon codes to be MDS. In particular, we introduce a new class of MDS double-twisted Reed-Solomon codes $\\mathcal{C}_{\\pmb \\alpha, \\pmb t, \\pmb h, \\pmb \\eta}$ with twists $\\pmb t = (1, 2)$ and hooks $\\pmb h = (0, 1)$ over the finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$, providing a non-trivial example over $\\mathbb{F}_{16}$ and enumeration over the finite fields of size up to 17. Additionally, we enumerate the single-twisted Reed-Solomon codes $\\mathcal{C}_{\\pmb \\alpha, t, h, \\eta}$ with twist $t=2$ and hook $h=1$. Moreover, we obtain necessary conditions for the existence of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon codes with zero and one-dimensional hull. Consequently, we derive conditions for the existence of MDS double-twisted Reed-Solomon codes with zero and one-dimensional hull. "
