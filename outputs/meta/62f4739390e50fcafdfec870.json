  "title": "Mathematical Foundations of Complex Tonality",
  "abstract": "  Equal temperament, in which semitones are tuned in the irrational ratio of $2^{1/12} : 1$, is best seen as a serviceable compromise, sacrificing purity for flexibility. Just intonation, in which intervals given by products of powers of $2$, $3$, and $5$, is more natural, but of limited flexibility. We propose a new scheme in which ratios of Gaussian integers form the basis of an abstract tonal system. The tritone, so problematic in just temperament, given ambiguously by the ratios $\\tfrac{45}{32}$, $\\tfrac{64}{45}$, $\\tfrac{36}{25}$, $\\tfrac{25}{18}$, none satisfactory, is in our scheme represented by the complex ratio $1 + \\rm{i} : 1$. The major and minor whole tones, given by intervals of $\\tfrac{9}{8}$ and $\\tfrac{10}{9}$, can each be factorized into products of complex semitones, giving us a major complex semitone $\\tfrac{3}{4}(1 + \\rm{i})$ and a minor complex semitone $\\tfrac{1}{3}(3 + \\rm{i})$. The perfect third, given by the interval $\\tfrac{5}{4}$, factorizes into the product of a complex whole tone $\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\rm{i})$ and its complex conjugate. Augmented with these supplementary tones, the resulting scheme of complex intervals based on products of powers of Gaussian primes leads very naturally to the construction of a complete system of major and minor scales in all keys.
