  "abstract": "  We introduce a new digraph width measure called directed branch-width. To do this, we generalize a characterization of graph classes of bounded tree-width in terms of their line graphs to digraphs. Although we prove that underlying branch-width cannot be bounded in terms of our new measure, we show that directed branch-width is a natural generalization of its undirected counterpart and indeed the two invariants can be related via the operation of identifying pairs of sources or pairs of sinks. Leveraging these operations and the relationship to underlying tree-width allows us to extend a range of algorithmic results from directed graphs with bounded underlying treewidth to the larger class of digraphs having bounded directed branch-width.
