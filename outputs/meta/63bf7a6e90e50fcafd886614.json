  "title": "Circuit simulation using explicit methods",
  "abstract": "  Use of explicit methods for simulating electrical circuits, especially for power electronics applications, is described. Application of the forward Euler method to a half-wave rectifier is discussed, and the limitations of a fixed-step method are pointed out. Implementation of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) method, which allows variable time steps, for the half-wave rectifier circuit is discussed, and its advantages pointed out. Formulation of circuit equations for the purpose of simulation using the RKF method is described for some more examples. Stability and accuracy issues related to power electronic circuits are brought out, and mechanisms to address them are presented. Future plans related to this work are described. "
