  "title": "Energy-Efficient Naming in Beeping Networks",
  "abstract": "  A single-hop beeping network is a distributed communication model in which all stations can communicate with one another by transmitting only one-bit messages, called beeps. This paper focuses on resolving the distributed computing area's two fundamental problems: naming and counting problems. We are particularly interested in optimizing the energy complexity and the running time of algorithms to resolve these problems. Our contribution is to design randomized algorithms with an optimal running time of O(n log n) and an energy complexity of O(log n) for both the naming and counting problems on single-hop beeping networks of n stations.
