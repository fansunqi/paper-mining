  "abstract": "  In this work we prove decidability of the model-checking problem for safe recursion schemes against properties defined by alternating B-automata. We then exploit this result to show how to compute downward closures of languages of finite trees recognized by safe recursion schemes.   Higher-order recursion schemes are an expressive formalism used to define languages of finite and infinite ranked trees by means of fixed points of lambda terms. They extend regular and context-free grammars, and are equivalent in expressive power to the simply typed $\\lambda Y$-calculus and collapsible pushdown automata. Safety in a syntactic restriction which limits their expressive power.   The class of alternating B-automata is an extension of alternating parity automata over infinite trees; it enhances them with counting features that can be used to describe boundedness properties. "
