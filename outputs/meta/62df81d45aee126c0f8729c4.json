  "title": "FAD: A Chinese Dataset for Fake Audio Detection",
  "abstract": "  Fake audio detection is a growing concern and some relevant datasets have been designed for research. But there is no standard public Chinese dataset under additive noise conditions. In this paper, we aim to fill in the gap and design a Chinese fake audio detection dataset (FAD) for studying more generalized detection methods. Twelve mainstream speech generation techniques are used to generate fake audios. To simulate the real-life scenarios, three noise datasets are selected for noisy adding at five different signal noise ratios. FAD dataset can be used not only for fake audio detection, but also for detecting the algorithms of fake utterances for audio forensics. Baseline results are presented with analysis. The results that show fake audio detection methods with generalization remain challenging. The FAD dataset is publicly available. "
