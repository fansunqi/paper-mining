  "abstract": "  Optical layer attacks on communication networks are one of the weakest reinforced areas of the network, allowing attackers to overcome security when proper safeguards are not put into place. Here, we present our solution or Quantum Encryption in Phase Space (QEPS), a physical layer encryption method to secure data over the optical fiber, based on our novel round-trip Coherent-based Two-Field Quantum Key Distribution (CTF-QKD) scheme. We perform a theoretical study through simulation and provide an experimental demonstration. The same encryption is used for QEPS as CTF-QKD but achieved through a pre-shared key and one-directional transmission design. QEPS is uniquely different from traditional technology where encryption is performed at the optical domain with coherent states by applying a quantum phase-shifting operator. The pre-shared secret is used to seed a deterministic random number generator and control the phase modulator at the transmitter for encryption and at the receiver for decryption. Using commercially available simulation software, we study two preventative measures for different modulation formats which will prevent an eavesdropper from obtaining any data. QEPS demonstrates that it is secure against tapping attacks when attackers have no information of the phase modulator and pre-shared key. Finally, an experiment with commercial components demonstrates QEPS system integrability. "
