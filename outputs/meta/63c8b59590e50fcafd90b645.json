  "abstract": "  Humans can effortlessly perform very complex, dexterous manipulation tasks by reacting to sensor observations. In contrast, robots can not perform reactive manipulation and they mostly operate in open-loop while interacting with their environment. Consequently, the current manipulation algorithms either are inefficient in performance or can only work in highly structured environments. In this paper, we present closed-loop control of a complex manipulation task where a robot uses a tool to interact with objects. Manipulation using a tool leads to complex kinematics and contact constraints that need to be satisfied for generating feasible manipulation trajectories. We first present an open-loop controller design using Non-Linear Programming (NLP) that satisfies these constraints. In order to design a closed-loop controller, we present a pose estimator of objects and tools using tactile sensors. Using our tactile estimator, we design a closed-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed algorithm is verified using a 6 DoF manipulator on tasks using a variety of objects and tools. We verify that our closed-loop controller can successfully perform tool manipulation under several unexpected contacts.
