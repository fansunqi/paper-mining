  "title": "Vox-Surf: Voxel-based Implicit Surface Representation",
  "abstract": "  Virtual content creation and interaction play an important role in modern 3D applications such as AR and VR. Recovering detailed 3D models from real scenes can significantly expand the scope of its applications and has been studied for decades in the computer vision and computer graphics community. We propose Vox-Surf, a voxel-based implicit surface representation. Our Vox-Surf divides the space into finite bounded voxels. Each voxel stores geometry and appearance information in its corner vertices. Vox-Surf is suitable for almost any scenario thanks to sparsity inherited from voxel representation and can be easily trained from multiple view images. We leverage the progressive training procedure to extract important voxels gradually for further optimization so that only valid voxels are preserved, which greatly reduces the number of sampling points and increases rendering speed.The fine voxels can also be considered as the bounding volume for collision detection.The experiments show that Vox-Surf representation can learn delicate surface details and accurate color with less memory and faster rendering speed than other methods.We also show that Vox-Surf can be more practical in scene editing and AR applications.
