  "title": "Analogical proportions in monounary algebras and difference proportions",
  "abstract": "  This paper studies analogical proportions in monounary algebras consisting only of a universe and a single unary function. We show that the analogical proportion relation is characterized in the infinite monounary algebra formed by the natural numbers together with the successor function via difference proportions. "
