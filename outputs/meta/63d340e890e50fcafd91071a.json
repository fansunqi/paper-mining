  "title": "Source Address Validation",
  "abstract": "  Source address validation (SAV) is a standard formalized in RFC 2827 aimed at discarding packets with spoofed source IP addresses. The absence of SAV has been known as a root cause of reflection distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Outbound SAV (oSAV): filtering applied at the network edge to traffic coming from inside the customer network to the outside. Inbound SAV (iSAV): filtering applied at the network edge to traffic coming from the outside to the customer network. "
