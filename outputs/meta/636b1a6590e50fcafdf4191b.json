  "abstract": "  Given a set of points $P = (P^+ \\sqcup P^-) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d$ and a supply function $\\mu:P\\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\mu(p) > 0~\\forall p \\in P^+$, $\\mu(p) < 0~\\forall p \\in P^-$, and $\\sum_{p\\in P}{\\mu(p)} = 0$, the geometric transportation problem asks one to find a transportation map $\\tau: P^+\\times P^-\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ such that $\\sum_{q\\in P^-}{\\tau(p, q)} = \\mu(p)~\\forall p \\in P^+$, $\\sum_{p\\in P^+}{\\tau(p, q)} = -\\mu(q)~ \\forall q \\in P^-$, and the weighted sum of Euclidean distances for the pairs $\\sum_{(p,q)\\in P^+\\times P^-}\\tau(p, q)\\cdot ||q-p||_2$ is minimized. We present the first deterministic algorithm that computes, in near-linear time, a transportation map whose cost is within a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$ factor of optimal. More precisely, our algorithm runs in $O(n\\varepsilon^{-(d+2)}\\log^5{n}\\log{\\log{n}})$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.   Surprisingly, our result is not only a generalization of a bipartite matching one to arbitrary instances of geometric transportation, but it also reduces the running time for all previously known $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms, randomized or deterministic, even for geometric bipartite matching. In particular, we give the first $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate deterministic algorithm for geometric bipartite matching and the first $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate deterministic or randomized algorithm for geometric transportation with no dependence on $d$ in the exponent of the running time's polylog.   As an additional application of our main ideas, we also give the first randomized near-linear $O(poly(1 / \\varepsilon) m \\log^{O(1)} n)$ time $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the uncapacitated minimum cost flow (transshipment) problem in undirected graphs with arbitrary real edge costs.
