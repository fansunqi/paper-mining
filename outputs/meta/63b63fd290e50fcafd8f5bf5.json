  "title": "UAV aided Metaverse over Wireless Communications: A Reinforcement\n  Learning Approach",
  "abstract": "  Metaverse is expected to create a virtual world closely connected with reality to provide users with immersive experience with the support of 5G high data rate communication technique. A huge amount of data in physical world needs to be synchronized to the virtual world to provide immersive experience for users, and there will be higher requirements on coverage to include more users into Metaverse. However, 5G signal suffers severe attenuation, which makes it more expensive to maintain the same coverage. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising candidate technique for future implementation of Metaverse as a low-cost and high-mobility platform for communication devices. In this paper, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based double-agent cooperative reinforcement learning method for channel allocation and trajectory control of UAV to collect and synchronize data from the physical world to the virtual world, and expand the coverage of Metaverse services economically. Simulation results show that our proposed method is able to achieve better performance compared to the benchmark approaches. "
