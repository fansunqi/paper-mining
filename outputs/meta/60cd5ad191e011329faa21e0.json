  "abstract": "  Connected decision boundaries are useful in several tasks like image segmentation, clustering, alpha-shape or defining a region in nD-space. However, the machine learning literature lacks methods for generating connected decision boundaries using neural networks. Thresholding an invex function, a generalization of a convex function, generates such decision boundaries. This paper presents two methods for constructing invex functions using neural networks. The first approach is based on constraining a neural network with Gradient Clipped-Gradient Penality (GCGP), where we clip and penalise the gradients. In contrast, the second one is based on the relationship of the invex function to the composition of invertible and convex functions. We employ connectedness as a basic interpretation method and create connected region-based classifiers. We show that multiple connected set based classifiers can approximate any classification function. In the experiments section, we use our methods for classification tasks using an ensemble of 1-vs-all models as well as using a single multiclass model on larger-scale datasets. The experiments show that connected set-based classifiers do not pose any disadvantage over ordinary neural network classifiers, but rather, enhance their interpretability. We also did an extensive study on the properties of invex function and connected sets for interpretability and network morphism with experiments on simulated and real-world data sets. Our study suggests that invex function is fundamental to understanding and applying locality and connectedness of input space which is useful for various downstream tasks. "
