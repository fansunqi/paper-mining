  "abstract": "  The objective of the work was to realize a preliminary study of proof-of-concept to evaluate emotions using thermographic images and blood perfusion algorithm; the images were obtained for baseline and positive and negative valence according to the protocol of the Geneva Affective Picture Database. The blood perfusion algorithm is based on the heat transport equation. The average temperature and blood perfusion in forehead, periorbital eyes, cheeks, nose and upper lips were determined. Absolute and percentage differences between the valences and the baseline were calculated. For negative valence, a decrease in temperature and blood perfusion was observed in the ROIs, and the effect was greater on the left side than on the right side. In positive valence, the temperature and blood perfusion increased in some cases, showing a complex pattern. The temperature and perfusion of the nose was reduced for both valences, which is indicative of the arousal dimension. The blood perfusion images were found to be greater contrast; the percentage differences in the blood perfusion images are greater than those obtained in thermographic images. Moreover, the blood perfusion images, and vasomotor answer are consistent, therefore, they can be a better biomarker than thermographic analysis in identifying emotions. "
