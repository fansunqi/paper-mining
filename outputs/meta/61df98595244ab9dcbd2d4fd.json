  "title": "Reducing Noise Level in Differential Privacy through Matrix Masking",
  "abstract": "  Differential privacy schemes have been widely adopted in recent years to address issues of data privacy protection. We propose a new Gaussian scheme combining with another data protection technique, called random orthogonal matrix masking, to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) more efficiently. We prove that the additional matrix masking significantly reduces the rate of noise variance required in the Gaussian scheme to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)-$DP in big data setting. Specifically, when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $\\delta \\to 0$, and the sample size $n$ exceeds the number $p$ of attributes by $(n-p)=O(ln(1/\\delta))$, the required additive noise variance to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP is reduced from $O(ln(1/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ to $O(1/\\varepsilon)$. With much less noise added, the resulting differential privacy protected pseudo data sets allow much more accurate inferences, thus can significantly improve the scope of application for differential privacy.
