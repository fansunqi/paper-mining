  "abstract": "  Small neural networks (NNs) used for error correction were shown to improve on classic channel codes and to address channel model changes. We extend the code dimension of any such structure by using the same NN under one-hot encoding multiple times, then serially-concatenated with an outer classic code. We design NNs with the same network parameters, where each Reed-Solomon codeword symbol is an input to a different NN. Significant improvements in block error probabilities for an additive Gaussian noise channel as compared to the small neural code are illustrated, as well as robustness to channel model changes. "
