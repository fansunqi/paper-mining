  "title": "Analysis of UAV Corridors in Cellular Networks",
  "abstract": "  In this article, we introduce a new mathematical framework for the analysis and design of UAV corridors in cellular networks, while considering a realistic network deployment, antenna radiation pattern, and propagation channel model. By leveraging quantization theory, we optimize the electrical tilts of existing ground cellular base stations to maximize the coverage of both legacy ground users and UAVs flying along specified aerial routes. Our practical case study shows that the optimized network results in a cell partitioning that significantly differs from the usual hexagonal pattern, and that it can successfully guarantee coverage all over the UAV corridors without degrading the perceived signal strength on the ground.
