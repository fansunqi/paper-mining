  "title": "Color Me Intrigued: Quantifying Usage of Colors in Fiction",
  "abstract": "  We present preliminary results in quantitative analyses of color usage in selected authors' works from LitBank. Using Glasgow Norms, human ratings on 5000+ words, we measure attributes of nouns dependent on color terms. Early results demonstrate a significant increase in noun concreteness over time. We also propose future research directions for computational literary color analytics. "
