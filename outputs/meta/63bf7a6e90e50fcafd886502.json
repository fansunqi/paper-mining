  "title": "Dataset of Fluorescence Spectra and Chemical Parameters of Olive Oils",
  "abstract": "  This dataset encompasses fluorescence spectra and chemical parameters of 24 olive oil samples from the 2019-2020 harvest provided by the producer Conde de Benalua, Granada, Spain. The oils are characterized by different qualities: 10 extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), 8 virgin olive oil (VOO), and 6 lampante olive oil (LOO) samples. For each sample, the dataset includes fluorescence spectra obtained with two excitation wavelengths, oil quality, and five chemical parameters necessary for the quality assessment of olive oil. The fluorescence spectra were obtained by exciting the samples at 365 nm and 395 nm under identical conditions. The dataset includes the values of the following chemical parameters for each olive oil sample: acidity, peroxide value, K270, K232, ethyl esters, and the quality of the samples (EVOO, VOO, or LOO). The dataset offers a unique possibility for researchers in food technology to develop machine learning models based on fluorescence data for the quality assessment of olive oil due to the availability of both spectroscopic and chemical data. The dataset can be used, for example, to predict one or multiple chemical parameters or to classify samples based on their quality from fluorescence spectra. "
