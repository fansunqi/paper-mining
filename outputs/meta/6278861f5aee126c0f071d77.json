  "title": "Two Rapid Power Iterative DOA Estimators for UAV Emitter Using\n  Massive/Ultra-massive Receive Array",
  "abstract": "  To provide rapid direction finding (DF) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) emitter in future wireless networks, a low-complexity direction of arrival (DOA) estimation architecture for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) receiver arrays is constructed. In this paper, we propose two strategies to address the extremely high complexity caused by eigenvalue decomposition of the received signal covariance matrix. Firstly, a rapid power-iterative rotational invariance (RPI-RI) method is proposed, which adopts the signal subspace generated by power iteration to gets the final direction estimation through rotational invariance between subarrays. RPI-RI makes a significant complexity reduction at the cost of a substantial performance loss. In order to further reduce the complexity and provide a good directional measurement result, a rapid power-iterative Polynomial rooting (RPI-PR) method is proposed, which utilizes the noise subspace combined with polynomial solution method to get the optimal direction estimation. In addition, the influence of initial vector selection on convergence in the power iteration is analyzed, especially when the initial vector is orthogonal to the incident wave. Simulation results show that the two proposed methods outperform the conventional DOA estimation methods in terms of computational complexity. In particular, the RPIPR method achieves more than two orders of magnitude lower complexity than conventional methods and achieves performance close to CRLB. Moreover, it is verified that the initial vector and the relative error have a significant impact on the performance of the computational complexity. "
