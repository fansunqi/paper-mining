  "title": "Brain Tissue Segmentation Across the Human Lifespan via Supervised\n  Contrastive Learning",
  "abstract": "  Automatic segmentation of brain MR images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is critical for tissue volumetric analysis and cortical surface reconstruction. Due to dramatic structural and appearance changes associated with developmental and aging processes, existing brain tissue segmentation methods are only viable for specific age groups. Consequently, methods developed for one age group may fail for another. In this paper, we make the first attempt to segment brain tissues across the entire human lifespan (0-100 years of age) using a unified deep learning model. To overcome the challenges related to structural variability underpinned by biological processes, intensity inhomogeneity, motion artifacts, scanner-induced differences, and acquisition protocols, we propose to use contrastive learning to improve the quality of feature representations in a latent space for effective lifespan tissue segmentation. We compared our approach with commonly used segmentation methods on a large-scale dataset of 2,464 MR images. Experimental results show that our model accurately segments brain tissues across the lifespan and outperforms existing methods. "
