  "abstract": "  A storage code on a graph $G$ is a set of assignments of symbols to the vertices such that every vertex can recover its value by looking at its neighbors. We consider the question of constructing large-size storage codes on triangle-free graphs constructed as coset graphs of binary linear codes. Previously it was shown that there are infinite families of binary storage codes on coset graphs with rate converging to 3/4. Here we show that codes on such graphs can attain rate asymptotically approaching 1.   Equivalently, this question can be phrased as a version of hat-guessing games on graphs (e.g., P.J. Cameron e.a., \\emph{Electronic J. Comb.} 2016). In this language, we construct triangle-free graphs with success probability of the players approaching one as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Equivalently again, there exist linear index codes on such graphs of rate approaching zero.   Another family of storage codes on triangle-free graphs of rate approaching 1 was constructed earlier by A. Golovnev and I. Haviv (36th Computational Complexity Conf., 2021) relying on a different family of graphs. "
