  "title": "Artificial Intelligence Generated Coins for Size Comparison",
  "abstract": "  Authors of scientific articles use coins in photographs as a size reference for objects. For this purpose, coins are placed next to objects when taking the photo. In this letter we propose a novel method that uses artificial intelligence (AI) generated images of coins to provide a size reference in photos. The newest generation is able to quickly generate realistic high-quality images from textual descriptions. With the proposed method no physical coin is required while taking photos. Coins can be added to photos that contain none. Furthermore, we show how the coin motif can be matched to the object. "
