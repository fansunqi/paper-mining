  "abstract": "  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) protects data privacy in cloud computing by enabling computations to directly occur on ciphertexts. To improve the time-consuming FHE operations, we present an electro-optical (EO) FHE accelerator, CryptoLight. Compared to prior FHE accelerators, on average, CryptoLight reduces the latency of various FHE applications by >94.4% and the energy consumption by >95% "
