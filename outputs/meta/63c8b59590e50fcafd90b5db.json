  "title": "$Ae^2I$: A Double Autoencoder for Imputation of Missing Values",
  "abstract": "  The most common strategy of imputing missing values in a table is to study either the column-column relationship or the row-row relationship of the data table, then use the relationship to impute the missing values based on the non-missing values from other columns of the same row, or from the other rows of the same column. This paper introduces a double autoencoder for imputation ($Ae^2I$) that simultaneously and collaboratively uses both row-row relationship and column-column relationship to impute the missing values. Empirical tests on Movielens 1M dataset demonstrated that $Ae^2I$ outperforms the current state-of-the-art models for recommender systems by a significant margin. "
