  "abstract": "Social coding platforms such as GitHub have become defacto environments for\ncollaborative programming and open source. When these platforms do not support\nspecific cognitive styles, they create barriers to programming for some\npopulations. Research shows that the cognitive styles typically favored by\nwomen are often unsupported, creating barriers to entry for woman newcomers. In\nthis paper, we use the GenderMag method to evaluate GitHub to find cognitive\nstyle-specific inclusivity bugs. We redesigned the \"buggy\" GitHub features\nthrough a web browser plugin, which we evaluated through a between-subjects\nexperiment (n=75). Our results indicate that the changes to the interface\nimprove users' performance and self-efficacy, mainly for individuals with\ncognitive styles more common to women. Our results can inspire designers of\nsocial coding platforms and software engineering tools to produce more\ninclusive development environments."
