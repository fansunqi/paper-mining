  "abstract": "Comparative diagnostic in brain tumor evaluation makes possible to use the\navailable information of a medical center to compare similar cases when a new\npatient is evaluated. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence models, the\nproposed system is able of retrieving the most similar cases of brain tumors\nfor a given query. The primary objective is to enhance the diagnostic process\nby generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a\nparticular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. A key\ndistinction from previous models lies in its ability to produce enriched image\ndescriptors solely from binary information, eliminating the need for costly and\ndifficult to obtain tumor segmentation.\n  The proposed model uses Artificial Intelligence to detect patient features to\nrecommend the most similar cases from a database. The system not only suggests\nsimilar cases but also balances the representation of healthy and abnormal\nfeatures in its design. This not only encourages the generalization of its use\nbut also aids clinicians in their decision-making processes. This\ngeneralization makes possible for future research in different medical\ndiagnosis areas with almost not any change in the system.\n  We conducted a comparative analysis of our approach in relation to similar\nstudies. The proposed architecture obtains a Dice coefficient of 0.474 in both\ntumoral and healthy regions of the patients, which outperforms previous\nliterature. Our proposed model excels at extracting and combining anatomical\nand pathological features from brain scans, achieving state-of-the-art results\nwhile relying on less expensive label information. This substantially reduces\nthe overall cost of the training process. Our findings highlight the\nsignificant potential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of comparative\ndiagnostics and the treatment of tumoral pathologies."
