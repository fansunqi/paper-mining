  "abstract": "  Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) is a realistic setting of semi-supervised learning where the unlabeled training set contains classes that are not present in the labeled set. Many existing OSSL methods assume that these out-of-distribution data are harmful and put effort into excluding data from unknown classes from the training objective. In contrast, we propose an OSSL framework that facilitates learning from all unlabeled data through self-supervision. Additionally, we utilize an energy-based score to accurately recognize data belonging to the known classes, making our method well-suited for handling uncurated data in deployment. We show through extensive experimental evaluations on several datasets that our method shows overall unmatched robustness and performance in terms of closed-set accuracy and open-set recognition compared with state-of-the-art for OSSL. Our code will be released upon publication. "
