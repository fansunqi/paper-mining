  "abstract": "  Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\\Re^2$. For a parameter $\\varepsilon\\in (0,1)$, a subset $C\\subseteq P$ is an \\emph{$\\varepsilon$-kernel} of $P$ if the projection of the convex hull of $C$ approximates that of $P$ within $(1-\\varepsilon)$-factor in every direction. The set $C$ is a \\emph{weak $\\varepsilon$-kernel} of $P$ if its directional width approximates that of $P$ in every direction. Let $\\mathsf{k}_{\\varepsilon}(P)$ (resp.\\ $\\mathsf{k}^{\\mathsf{w}}_{\\varepsilon}(P)$) denote the minimum-size of an $\\varepsilon$-kernel (resp. weak $\\varepsilon$-kernel) of $P$. We present an $O(n\\mathsf{k}_{\\varepsilon}(P)\\log n)$-time algorithm for computing an $\\varepsilon$-kernel of $P$ of size $\\mathsf{k}_{\\varepsilon}(P)$, and an $O(n^2\\log n)$-time algorithm for computing a weak $\\varepsilon$-kernel of $P$ of size ${\\mathsf{k}}^{\\mathsf{w}}_{\\varepsilon}(P)$. We also present a fast algorithm for the Hausdorff variant of this problem. In addition, we introduce the notion of \\emph{$\\varepsilon$-core}, a convex polygon lying inside $\\mathsf{ch}(P)$, prove that it is a good approximation of the optimal $\\varepsilon$-kernel, present an efficient algorithm for computing it, and use it to compute an $\\varepsilon$-kernel of small size.
