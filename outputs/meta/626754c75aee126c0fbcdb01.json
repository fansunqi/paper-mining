  "abstract": "  The new concept of semi-integrated-sensing-and-communication (Semi-ISaC) is proposed for next-generation cellular networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art, where the total bandwidth is used for integrated sensing and communication (ISaC), the proposed Semi-ISaC framework provides more freedom as it allows that a portion of the bandwidth is exclusively used for either wireless communication or radar detection, while the rest is for ISaC transmission. To enhance the bandwidth efficiency (BE), we investigate the evolution of Semi-ISaC networks from orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). First, we evaluate the performance of an OMA-based Semi-ISaC network. As for the communication signals, we investigate both the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate. As for the radar echoes, we characterize the ergodic radar estimation information rate (REIR). Then, we investigate the performance of a NOMA-based Semi-ISaC network, including the OP and the ergodic rate for communication signals and the ergodic REIR for radar echoes. The diversity gains of OP and the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes of the ergodic REIR are also evaluated as insights. The analytical results indicate that: 1) Under a two-user NOMA-based Semi-ISaC scenario, the diversity order of the near-user is equal to the coefficient of the Nakagami-m fading channels (m), while that of the far-user is zero; and 2) The high-SNR slope for the ergodic REIR is based on the ratio of the radar signal's duty cycle to the pulse duration. Our simulation results show that: 1) Semi-ISaC has better channel capacity than the conventional ISaC; and 2) The NOMA-based Semi-ISaC has better channel capacity than the OMA-based Semi-ISaC. "
