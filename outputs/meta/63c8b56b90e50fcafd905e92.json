  "abstract": "Controlling the interaction forces between a human and an exoskeleton is\ncrucial for providing transparency or adjusting assistance or resistance\nlevels. However, it is an open problem to control the interaction forces of\nlower-limb exoskeletons designed for unrestricted overground walking. For these\ntypes of exoskeletons, it is challenging to implement force/torque sensors at\nevery contact between the user and the exoskeleton for direct force\nmeasurement. Moreover, it is important to compensate for the exoskeleton's\nwhole-body gravitational and dynamical forces, especially for heavy lower-limb\nexoskeletons. Previous works either simplified the dynamic model by treating\nthe legs as independent double pendulums, or they did not close the loop with\ninteraction force feedback.\n  The proposed whole-exoskeleton closed-loop compensation (WECC) method\ncalculates the interaction torques during the complete gait cycle by using\nwhole-body dynamics and joint torque measurements on a hip-knee exoskeleton.\nFurthermore, it uses a constrained optimization scheme to track desired\ninteraction torques in a closed loop while considering physical and safety\nconstraints. We evaluated the haptic transparency and dynamic interaction\ntorque tracking of WECC control on three subjects. We also compared the\nperformance of WECC with a controller based on a simplified dynamic model and a\npassive version of the exoskeleton. The WECC controller results in a\nconsistently low absolute interaction torque error during the whole gait cycle\nfor both zero and nonzero desired interaction torques. In contrast, the\nsimplified controller yields poor performance in tracking desired interaction\ntorques during the stance phase."
