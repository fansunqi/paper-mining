  "abstract": "  Using oblique projections and angles between subspaces we write condition number estimates for abstract nonsymmetric domain decomposition methods. In particular, we consider a restricted additive method for the Poisson equation and write a bound for the condition number of the preconditioned operator. We also obtain the non-negativity of the preconditioned operator. Condition number estimates are not enough for the convergence of iterative methods such as GMRES but these bounds may lead to further understanding of nonsymmetric domain decomposition methods. "
