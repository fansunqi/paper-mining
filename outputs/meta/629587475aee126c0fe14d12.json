  "title": "Most Equitable Voting Rules",
  "abstract": "  In social choice, anonymity (all agents being treated equally) and neutrality (all alternatives being treated equally) are widely regarded as \"minimal demands\" and \"uncontroversial\" axioms of equity and fairness. However, due to the ANR impossibility theorem, no voting rule satisfies anonymity, neutrality, and resolvability (always choosing one winner). How to design voting rules that optimally satisfy anonymity, neutrality, and resolvability remains an open question.   We address this question for a wide range of preferences and decisions that include ranked lists and committees. Our conceptual contribution is a novel and strong notion of most equitable refinements for any irresolute rule that satisfies anonymity and neutrality. Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the conditions for the ANR impossibility to hold for general settings. Second, we propose the most-favorable-permutation (MFP) tie-breaking to obtain a most equitable refinement and design a polynomial-time algorithm to compute it when agents' preferences are full rankings. Third, we establish tight bounds on the semi-random likelihood of ANR violations, showing that the likelihood is low for all anonymous and neutral irresolute rules with MFP tie-breaking. "
