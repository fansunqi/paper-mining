  "abstract": "  Remote sensing of rainfall events is critical for both operational and scientific needs, including for example weather forecasting, extreme flood mitigation, water cycle monitoring, etc. Ground-based weather radars, such as NOAA's Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD), provide reflectivity and precipitation estimates of rainfall events. However, their observation range is limited to a few hundred kilometers, prompting the exploration of other remote sensing methods, particularly over the open ocean, that represents large areas not covered by land-based radars. Here we propose a deep learning approach to extract rainfall information from SAR imagery. SAR has the advantage of providing global coverage and a very high resolution. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network trained on a collocated Sentinel-1/NEXRAD dataset clearly outperforms state-of-the-art filtering schemes such as the Koch's filters, which has been implemented here as a neural network in a machine learning framework. Our results indicate high performance in segmenting precipitation regimes, delineated by thresholds at 24.7, 31.5, and 38.8 dBZ. Compared to current methods that rely on Koch's filters to draw binary rainfall maps, these multi-threshold learning-based models can provide rainfall estimation. They may be of great interest for improving the qualification of SAR-derived wind field data. "
