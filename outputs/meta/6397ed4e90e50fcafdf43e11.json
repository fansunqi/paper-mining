  "title": "PyPop7: A Pure-Python Library for Population-Based Black-Box\n  Optimization",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a pure-Python library called PyPop7 for black-box optimization (BBO). As population-based methods are becoming increasingly popular for BBO, our design goal is to provide a unified API and elegant implementations for them, particularly for high-dimensional cases. Since population-based methods suffer easily from the curse of dimenisoanlity owing to their random sampling nature, various improvements have been proposed to alleviate this issue via exploiting possible problem structures: such as space decomposition, low-memory approximation, low-rank metric learning, variance reduction, ensemble of random subspaces, model self-adaptation, and smoothing. Now PyPop7 has covered these advances with $>72$ versions and variants of 13 BBO algorithm families from different research communities. Its open-source code and full-fledged documents are available at https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop and https://pypop.readthedocs.io, respectively. "
