  "title": "Measuring a Priori Voting Power -- Taking Delegations Seriously",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce new power indices to measure the criticality of voters involved in different elections where delegations play a key role, namely, two variants of the proxy voting setting and a liquid democracy setting. First, we argue that our power indices are natural extensions of the Penrose-Banzhaf index in classic simple voting games, illustrating their intuitions. We show that recursive formulas can compute these indices for weighted voting games in pseudo-polynomial time. Last, we highlight theoretical properties and provide numerical results to illustrate how introducing delegation options modifies the voting power of voters. "
