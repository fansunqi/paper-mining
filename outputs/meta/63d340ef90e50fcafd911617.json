  "title": "From medical imaging to virtual reality for archaeology",
  "abstract": "  The IRMA project aims to design innovative methodologies for research in the field of historical and archaeological heritage based on a combination of medical imaging technologies and interactive 3D restitution modalities (virtual reality, augmented reality, haptics, additive manufacturing). These tools are based on recent research results from a collaboration between IRISA, Inrap and the company Image ET and are intended for cultural heritage professionals such as museums, curators, restorers and archaeologists.
