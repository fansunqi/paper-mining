  "abstract": "  Given a relation on $ X \\times Y $, we can construct two abstract simplicial complexes called Dowker complexes. The geometric realizations of these simplicial complexes are homotopically equivalent. We show that if two relations are conjugate, then they have homotopically equivalent Dowker complexes. From a self-relation on $ X $, this is a directed graph, and we use the Dowker complexes to study their properties. We show that if two relations are shift equivalent, then, at some power of the relation, their Dowker complexes are homotopically equivalent. Finally, we define a new filtration based on Dowker complexes with different powers of a relation. "
