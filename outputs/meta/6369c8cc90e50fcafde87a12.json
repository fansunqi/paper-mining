  "abstract": "  The Bayesian Context Trees (BCT) framework is a recently introduced, general collection of statistical and algorithmic tools for modelling, analysis and inference with discrete-valued time series. The foundation of this development is built in part on some well-known information-theoretic ideas and techniques, including Rissanen's tree sources and Willems et al.'s context-tree weighting algorithm. This paper presents a collection of theoretical results that provide mathematical justifications and further insight into the BCT modelling framework and the associated practical tools. It is shown that the BCT prior predictive likelihood (the probability of a time series of observations averaged over all models and parameters) is both pointwise and minimax optimal, in agreement with the MDL principle and the BIC criterion. The posterior distribution is shown to be asymptotically consistent with probability one (over both models and parameters), and asymptotically Gaussian (over the parameters). And the posterior predictive distribution is also shown to be asymptotically consistent with probability one. "
