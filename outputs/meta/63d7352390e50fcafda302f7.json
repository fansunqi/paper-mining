  "title": "Mixed Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising",
  "abstract": "  Hyperspectral image denoising is unique for the highly similar and correlated spectral information that should be properly considered. However, existing methods show limitations in exploring the spectral correlations across different bands and feature interactions within each band. Besides, the low- and high-level features usually exhibit different importance for different spatial-spectral regions, which is not fully explored for current algorithms as well. In this paper, we present a Mixed Attention Network (MAN) that simultaneously considers the inter- and intra-spectral correlations as well as the interactions between low- and high-level spatial-spectral meaningful features. Specifically, we introduce a multi-head recurrent spectral attention that efficiently integrates the inter-spectral features across all the spectral bands. These features are further enhanced with a progressive spectral channel attention by exploring the intra-spectral relationships. Moreover, we propose an attentive skip-connection that adaptively controls the proportion of the low- and high-level spatial-spectral features from the encoder and decoder to better enhance the aggregated features. Extensive experiments show that our MAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real noise settings while maintaining a low cost of parameters and running time. "
