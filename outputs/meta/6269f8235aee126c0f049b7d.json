  "abstract": "  The circular cartogram, also known as the Dorling map, is a widely used tool for visualizing statistical data. It represents regions as circles with their areas in proportion to the statistical values and requires circle displacement to avoid overlap and maintain spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose a new approach for circular cartogram production that utilizes the elastic beam displacement algorithm in cartographic generalization. First, the initial circles are generated with their areas in proportion to the statistical values. Second, an elastic beam structure is built as a proximity graph based on the spatial relations between the circles. Third, the circles violating the quality requirements are considered to have a force on the nodes of a beam. Fourth, the elastic beam algorithm is applied to assign forces for each node to determine the new positions of the circles. Steps two through four are repeated until a circular cartogram that meets the defined quality requirements is obtained. The experiments indicate that the proposed approach can successfully generate circular cartograms without overlaps while maintaining topology and relative relationships with higher quality than existing approaches.
