  "title": "High SNR Analysis of RIS-Aided MIMO Broadcast Channels",
  "abstract": "  We analyze the influence of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on the Gram channel eigenvalues in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario. This allows to connect specific channel properties with the rank improvement capabilities of the RIS. In particular, fundamental limits due to a possible line of sight (LOS) setup between the base station (BS) and the RIS are derived. Furthermore, dirty paper coding (DPC) based schemes are compared to linear precoding in such a scenario and it is shown that under certain channel conditions, the performance gap between DPC and linear precoding vanishes.
