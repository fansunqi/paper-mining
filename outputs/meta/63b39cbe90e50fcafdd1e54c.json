  "title": "Encrypted Data-driven Predictive Cloud Control with Disturbance Observer",
  "abstract": "  In data-driven predictive cloud control tasks, the privacy of data stored and used in cloud services could be leaked to malicious attackers or curious eavesdroppers. Homomorphic encryption technique could be used to protect data privacy while allowing computation. However, extra errors are introduced by the homomorphic encryption extension to ensure the privacy-preserving properties, and the real number truncation also brings uncertainty. Also, process and measure noise existed in system input and output may bring disturbance. In this work, a data-driven predictive cloud controller is developed based on homomorphic encryption to protect the cloud data privacy. Besides, a disturbance observer is introduced to estimate and compensate the encrypted control signal sequence computed in the cloud. The privacy of data is guaranteed by encryption and experiment results show the effect of our cloud-edge cooperative design. "
