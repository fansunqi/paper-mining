  "title": "PyRelationAL: a python library for active learning research and\n  development",
  "abstract": "  In constrained real-world scenarios, where it may be challenging or costly to generate data, disciplined methods for acquiring informative new data points are of fundamental importance for the efficient training of machine learning (ML) models. Active learning (AL) is a sub-field of ML focused on the development of methods to iteratively and economically acquire data through strategically querying new data points that are the most useful for a particular task. Here, we introduce PyRelationAL, an open source library for AL research. We describe a modular toolkit that is compatible with diverse ML frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, JAX). Furthermore, the library implements a wide range of published methods and provides API access to wide-ranging benchmark datasets and AL task configurations based on existing literature. The library is supplemented by an expansive set of tutorials, demos, and documentation to help users get started. PyRelationAL is maintained using modern software engineering practices -- with an inclusive contributor code of conduct -- to promote long term library quality and utilisation. PyRelationAL is available under a permissive Apache licence on PyPi and at https://github.com/RelationRx/pyrelational. "
