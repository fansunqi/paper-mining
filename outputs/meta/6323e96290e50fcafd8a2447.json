  "abstract": "  The Natarajan dimension is a fundamental tool for characterizing multi-class PAC learnability, generalizing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension from binary to multi-class classification problems. This work establishes upper bounds on Natarajan dimensions for certain function classes, including (i) multi-class decision tree and random forests, and (ii) multi-class neural networks with binary, linear and ReLU activations. These results may be relevant for describing the performance of certain multi-class learning algorithms. "
