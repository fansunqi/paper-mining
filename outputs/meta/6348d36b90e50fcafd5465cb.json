  "title": "CS-Insights: A System for Analyzing Computer Science Research",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents CS-Insights, an interactive web application to analyze computer science publications from DBLP through multiple perspectives. The dedicated interfaces allow its users to identify trends in research activity, productivity, accessibility, author's productivity, venues' statistics, topics of interest, and the impact of computer science research on other fields. CS-Insightsis publicly available, and its modular architecture can be easily adapted to domains other than computer science. "
