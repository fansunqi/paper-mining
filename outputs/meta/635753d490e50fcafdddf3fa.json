  "title": "Matching Map Recovery with an Unknown Number of Outliers",
  "abstract": "  We consider the problem of finding the matching map between two sets of $d$-dimensional noisy feature-vectors. The distinctive feature of our setting is that we do not assume that all the vectors of the first set have their corresponding vector in the second set. If $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of these two sets, we assume that the matching map that should be recovered is defined on a subset of unknown cardinality $k^*\\le \\min(n,m)$. We show that, in the high-dimensional setting, if the signal-to-noise ratio is larger than $5(d\\log(4nm/\\alpha))^{1/4}$, then the true matching map can be recovered with probability $1-\\alpha$. Interestingly, this threshold does not depend on $k^*$ and is the same as the one obtained in prior work in the case of $k = \\min(n,m)$. The procedure for which the aforementioned property is proved is obtained by a data-driven selection among candidate mappings $\\{\\hat\\pi_k:k\\in[\\min(n,m)]\\}$. Each $\\hat\\pi_k$ minimizes the sum of squares of distances between two sets of size $k$. The resulting optimization problem can be formulated as a minimum-cost flow problem, and thus solved efficiently. Finally, we report the results of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data that illustrate our theoretical results and provide further insight into the properties of the algorithms studied in this work.
