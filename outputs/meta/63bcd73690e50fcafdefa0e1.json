  "abstract": "  Terahertz (THz) band owning the abundant multi-ten-GHz bandwidth is capable to support Terabit-per-second wireless communications, which is a pillar technology for 6G and beyond systems. With sub-millimeter-long antennas, ultra-massive (UM) MIMO and intelligent surface (IS) systems with thousands of array elements are exploited to effectively combat the distance limitation and blockage problems, which compose a promising THz ultra-large antenna array (ULAA) system. As a combined effect of wavelength and array aperture, the resulting coverage of THz systems ranges from near-field to far-field, leading to a new paradigm of cross-field communications. Although channel models, communications theories, and networking strategies have been studied for far-field and near-field separately, the unified design of cross-field communications that achieve high spectral efficiency and low complexity is still missing. In this article, the challenges and features of THz ULAA cross-field communications are investigated. Furthermore, cross-field solutions in three perspectives are presented, including a hybrid spherical- and planar-wave channel model, cross-field channel estimation, and widely-spaced multi-subarray hybrid beamforming, where a subarray as a basic unit in THz ULAA systems is exploited. The approximation error of channel modeling accuracy, spectral efficiency, and estimation error of these designs are numerically evaluated. Finally, as a roadmap of THz ULAA cross-field communications, multiple open problems and potential research directions are elaborated. "
