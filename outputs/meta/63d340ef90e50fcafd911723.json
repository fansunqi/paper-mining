  "title": "A simple model for pink noise from amplitude modulations",
  "abstract": "  We propose a simple model for the origin of pink noise (or 1/f fluctuation) based on the beat of cooperative waves. These cooperative waves arise spontaneously in a system with synchronization, resonance, and infrared divergence. Many cooperative waves with close frequencies can produce signals of arbitrary small frequencies from a system of small size. This beat mechanism can be understood as amplitude modulation. The pink noise can appear after the demodulation process, which produces a variety of pink noise in many fields. The pink noise thus formed from the beat has nothing to do with dissipation or long-time memory. We also suggest new ways of looking at pink noise in shallow earthquakes, solar flares, and stellar activities. "
