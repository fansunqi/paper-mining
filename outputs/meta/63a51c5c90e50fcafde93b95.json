  "abstract": "  In our work, we study the age of information ($\\AoI$) in a multi-source system where $K$ sources transmit updates of their time-varying processes via a common-aggregator node to a destination node through a channel with packet delivery errors. We analyze $\\AoI$ for an $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1)$-Gilbert-Elliot ($\\GE$) packet erasure channel with a round-robin scheduling policy. We employ maximum distance separable ($\\MDS$) scheme at aggregator for encoding the multi-source updates. We characterize the mean $\\AoI$ for the $\\MDS$ coded system for the case of large blocklengths. We further show that the \\emph{optimal coding rate} that achieves maximum \\emph{coding gain} over the uncoded system is $n(1-\\pers)-\\smallO(n)$, where $\\pers \\triangleq \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\epsilon_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\epsilon_1$, and this maximum coding gain is $(1+\\pers)/(1+\\smallO(1))$.
