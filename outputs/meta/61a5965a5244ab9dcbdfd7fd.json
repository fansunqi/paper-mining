  "abstract": "  Cell-free massive MIMO is one of the core technologies for future wireless networks. It is expected to bring enormous benefits, including ultra-high reliability, data throughput, energy efficiency, and uniform coverage. As a radically distributed system, the performance of cell-free massive MIMO critically relies on efficient distributed processing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a distributed expectation propagation (EP) detector for cell-free massive MIMO, which consists of two modules: a nonlinear module at the central processing unit (CPU) and a linear module at each access point (AP). The turbo principle in iterative channel decoding is utilized to compute and pass the extrinsic information between the two modules. An analytical framework is provided to characterize the asymptotic performance of the proposed EP detector with a large number of antennas. Furthermore, a distributed iterative channel estimation and data detection (ICD) algorithm is developed to handle the practical setting with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Simulation results will show that the proposed method outperforms existing detectors for cell-free massive MIMO systems in terms of the bit-error rate and demonstrate that the developed theoretical analysis accurately predicts system performance. Finally, it is shown that with imperfect CSI, the proposed ICD algorithm improves the system performance significantly and enables non-orthogonal pilots to reduce the pilot overhead. "
