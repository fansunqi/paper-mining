  "abstract": "  Multi-agent policy gradient methods have demonstrated success in games and robotics but are often limited to problems with low-level action space. However, when agents take higher-level, temporally-extended actions (i.e. options), when and how to derive a centralized control policy, its gradient as well as sampling options for all agents while not interrupting current option executions, becomes a challenge. This is mostly because agents may choose and terminate their options \\textit{asynchronously}. In this work, we propose a conditional reasoning approach to address this problem, and empirically validate its effectiveness on representative option-based multi-agent cooperative tasks. "
