  "title": "Likelihood-free hypothesis testing",
  "abstract": "  Consider the problem of binary hypothesis testing. Given $Z$ coming from either $\\mathbb P^{\\otimes m}$ or $\\mathbb Q^{\\otimes m}$, to decide between the two with small probability of error it is sufficient and in most cases necessary to have $m \\asymp 1/\\epsilon^2$, where $\\epsilon$ measures the separation between $\\mathbb P$ and $\\mathbb Q$ in total variation ($\\mathsf{TV}$). Achieving this, however, requires complete knowledge of the distributions and can be done, for example, using the Neyman-Pearson test. In this paper we consider a variation of the problem, which we call likelihood-free (or simulation-based) hypothesis testing, where access to $\\mathbb P$ and $\\mathbb Q$ is given through $n$ iid observations from each. In the case when $\\mathbb P,\\mathbb Q$ are assumed to belong to a non-parametric family $\\mathcal P$, we demonstrate the existence of a fundamental trade-off between $n$ and $m$ given by $nm \\asymp n^2_\\mathsf{GoF}(\\epsilon,\\cal P)$, where $n_\\mathsf{GoF}$ is the minimax sample complexity of testing between the hypotheses $H_0: \\mathbb P= \\mathbb Q$ vs $H_1: \\mathsf{TV}(\\mathbb P,\\mathbb Q) \\ge \\epsilon$. We show this for three families of distributions: $\\beta$-smooth densities supported on $[0,1]^d$, the Gaussian sequence model over a Sobolev ellipsoid, and the collection of distributions on alphabet $[k]=\\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}$ with pmfs bounded by $c/k$ for fixed $c$. For the larger family of all distributions on $[k]$ we obtain a more complicated trade-off that exhibits a phase-transition. The test that we propose, based on the $L^2$-distance statistic of Ingster, simultaneously achieves all points on the trade-off curve for the regular classes. This demonstrates the possibility of testing without fully estimating the distributions, provided $m\\gg1/\\epsilon^2$. "
