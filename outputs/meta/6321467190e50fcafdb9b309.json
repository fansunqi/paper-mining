  "title": "A Note on the Quickest Minimum Cost Transshipment Problem",
  "abstract": "  Klinz and Woeginger (1995) prove that the minimum cost quickest flow problem is NP-hard. On the other hand, the quickest minimum cost flow problem can be solved efficiently via a straightforward reduction to the quickest flow problem without costs. More generally, we show how the quickest minimum cost transshipment problem can be reduced to the efficiently solvable quickest transshipment problem, thus adding another mosaic tile to the rich complexity landscape of flows over time.
