  "abstract": "  Given a class of graphs $\\mathcal{H}$, the problem $\\oplus\\mathsf{Sub}(\\mathcal{H})$ is defined as follows. The input is a graph $H\\in \\mathcal{H}$ together with an arbitrary graph $G$. The problem is to compute, modulo $2$, the number of subgraphs of $G$ that are isomorphic to $H$. The goal of this research is to determine for which classes $\\mathcal{H}$ the problem $\\oplus\\mathsf{Sub}(\\mathcal{H})$ is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), i.e., solvable in time $f(|H|)\\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$.   Curticapean, Dell, and Husfeldt (ESA 2021) conjectured that $\\oplus\\mathsf{Sub}(\\mathcal{H})$ is FPT if and only if the class of allowed patterns $\\mathcal{H}$ is \"matching splittable\", which means that for some fixed $B$, every $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ can be turned into a matching (a graph in which every vertex has degree at most $1$) by removing at most $B$ vertices.   Assuming the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis, we prove their conjecture for (I) all hereditary pattern classes $\\mathcal{H}$, and (II) all tree pattern classes, i.e., all classes $\\mathcal{H}$ such that every $H\\in \\mathcal{H}$ is a tree.   We also establish almost tight fine-grained upper and lower bounds for the case of hereditary patterns (I). "
