  "abstract": "  Fluent human-human teaming is often characterized by tacit interaction without explicit communication. This is because explicit communication, such as language utterances and gestures, are inherently interruptive. On the other hand, tacit interaction requires team situation awareness (TSA) to facilitate, which often relies on explicit communication to maintain, creating a paradox. In this paper, we consider implicit and naturalistic team status projection for tacit human-robot interaction. Implicitness minimizes interruption while naturalness reduces cognitive demand, and they together improve responsiveness to robots. We introduce a novel process for such Team status Projection via virtual Shadows, or TPS. We compare our method with two baselines that use explicit projection for maintaining TSA. Results via human factors studies demonstrate that TPS provides a more fluent human-robot interaction experience by significantly improving human responsiveness to robots in tacit teaming scenarios, which suggests better TSA. Participants acknowledged robots implementing TPS as more acceptable as a teammate and favorable. Simultaneously, we demonstrate that TPS is comparable to, and sometimes better than, the best-performing baseline in maintaining accurate TSA "
