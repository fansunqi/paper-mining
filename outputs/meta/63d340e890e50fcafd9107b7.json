  "abstract": "  Coviability refers to the multiple socio-ecological arrangements and governance structures under which humans and nature can coexist in functional, fair, and persistent ways. Transitioning to a coviable state in environmentally degraded and socially vulnerable territories is challenging. This paper presents an ongoing French-Brazilian joint research project combining machine learning, agroecology, and social sciences to discover coviability pathways that can be adopted and implemented by local populations in the North-East region of Brazil.
