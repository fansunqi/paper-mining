  "title": "Dimensioning spectrum to support ultra-reliable low-latency\n  communication",
  "abstract": "  Industry-led initiatives such as the Next G Alliance (NGA) are currently considering how to dimension the spectrum required to support new classes of services envisioned beyond 5G. In particular, support for URLLC brings the challenge of how to dimension stochastic wireless networks to meet stringent reliability and latency requirements. Our analysis indicates that the bandwidth needed to meet URLLC goals can be in the order of gigahertz, beyond what is available in today's mobile networks. Network densification can ease those bandwidth needs but requires new deployment strategies involving substantially larger numbers of sites. As an alternative, we consider multi-connectivity and multi-operator network sharing as efficient ways to reduce the demand for bandwidth without outright deployment of additional base stations. "
