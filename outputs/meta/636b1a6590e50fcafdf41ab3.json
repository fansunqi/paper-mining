  "abstract": "  Packet loss concealment (PLC) is a tool for enhancing speech degradation caused by poor network conditions or underflow/overflow in audio processing pipelines. We propose a real-time recurrent method that leverages previous outputs to mitigate artefact of lost packets without the prior knowledge of loss mask. The proposed full-band recurrent network (FRN) model operates at 48 kHz, which is suitable for high-quality telecommunication applications. Experiment results highlight the superiority of FRN over an offline non-causal baseline and a top performer in a recent PLC challenge. "
