  "abstract": "  Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent life-threatening cardiovascular diseases in which 6.5 million people are suffering in the USA and more than 23 million worldwide. Mechanical circulatory support of HF patients can be achieved by implanting a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) into HF patients as a bridge to transplant, recovery or destination therapy and can be controlled by measurement of normal and abnormal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). While there are no commercial long-term implantable pressure sensors to measure PAWP, real-time non-invasive estimation of abnormal and normal PAWP becomes vital. In this work, first an improved Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm called HHO+ is presented and tested on 24 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. Second, a novel fully Elman neural network (FENN) is proposed to improve the classification performance. Finally, four novel 18-layer deep learning methods of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-layer perceptron (CNN-MLP), CNN with Elman neural networks (CNN-ENN), CNN with fully Elman neural networks (CNN-FENN), and CNN with fully Elman neural networks optimized by HHO+ algorithm (CNN-FENN-HHO+) for classification of abnormal and normal PAWP using estimated HVAD pump flow were developed and compared. The estimated pump flow was derived by a non-invasive method embedded into the commercial HVAD controller. The proposed methods are evaluated on an imbalanced clinical dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed CNN-FENN-HHO+ method outperforms the proposed CNN-MLP, CNN-ENN and CNN-FENN methods and improved the classification performance metrics across 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods can reduce the likelihood of hazardous events like pulmonary congestion and ventricular suction for HF patients and notify identified abnormal cases to the hospital, clinician and cardiologist.
