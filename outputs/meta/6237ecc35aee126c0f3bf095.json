  "title": "Exact approaches for the Connected Vertex Cover problem",
  "abstract": "  Given a graph $G$, the Connected Vertex Cover problem (CVC) asks to find a minimum cardinality vertex cover of $G$ that induces a connected subgraph. In this paper we describe some approaches to solve the CVC problem exactly. First, we give compact mixed-integer extended formulations for CVC: these are the first formulations proposed for this problem, and can be easily adapted to variations of the problem such as Tree Cover. Second, we describe a simple branch and bound algorithm for the CVC problem. Finally, we implement our algorithm and compare its performance against our best formulation: contrary to what usually happens for the classical Vertex Cover problem, our formulation outperforms the branch and bound algorithm.
