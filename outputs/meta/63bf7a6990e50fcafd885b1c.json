  "title": "Predicting Hateful Discussions on Reddit using Graph Transformer\n  Networks and Communal Context",
  "abstract": "  We propose a system to predict harmful discussions on social media platforms. Our solution uses contextual deep language models and proposes the novel idea of integrating state-of-the-art Graph Transformer Networks to analyze all conversations that follow an initial post. This framework also supports adapting to future comments as the conversation unfolds. In addition, we study whether a community-specific analysis of hate speech leads to more effective detection of hateful discussions. We evaluate our approach on 333,487 Reddit discussions from various communities. We find that community-specific modeling improves performance two-fold and that models which capture wider-discussion context improve accuracy by 28\\% (35\\% for the most hateful content) compared to limited context models.
