  "abstract": "  TextDescriptives is a Python package for calculating a large variety of metrics from text. It is built on top of spaCy and can be easily integrated into existing workflows. The package has already been used for analysing the linguistic stability of clinical texts, creating features for predicting neuropsychiatric conditions, and analysing linguistic goals of primary school students. This paper describes the package and its features. "
