  "abstract": "  We consider semigroup algorithmic problems in the Special Affine group $\\mathsf{SA}(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\rtimes \\mathsf{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the group of affine transformations of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ that preserve orientation. Our paper focuses on two decision problems introduced by Choffrut and Karhum\\\"{a}ki (2005): the Identity Problem (does a semigroup contain a neutral element?) and the Group Problem (is a semigroup a group?) for finitely generated sub-semigroups of $\\mathsf{SA}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. We show that both problems are decidable and NP-complete. Since $\\mathsf{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\leq \\mathsf{SA}(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\leq \\mathsf{SL}(3, \\mathbb{Z})$, our result extends that of Bell, Hirvensalo and Potapov (SODA 2017) on the NP-completeness of both problems in $\\mathsf{SL}(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, and contributes a first step towards the open problems in $\\mathsf{SL}(3, \\mathbb{Z})$.
