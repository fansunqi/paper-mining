  "abstract": "  Aiming at the disorder problem (i.e. uncertainty problem) of the utilization of network resources commonly existing in multi-hop transmission networks, the paper proposes the idea and the corresponding supporting theory, i.e. theory of network wave, by constructing volatility information transmission mechanism between the sending nodes and their corresponding receiving nodes of a pair of paths (composed of two primary paths), so as to improve the orderliness of the utilization of network resources. It is proved that the maximum asymptotic throughput of a primary path depends on its intrinsic period, which in itself is equal to the intrinsic interference intensity of a primary path. Based on the proposed theory of network wave, an algorithm for the transmission of information blocks based on the intrinsic period of a primary path is proposed, which can maximize the asymptotic throughput of a primary path. In the cases of traversals with equal opportunities, an algorithm for the cooperative volatility transmission of information blocks in a pair of paths based on the set of maximum supporting elements is proposed. It is proved that the algorithm can maximize the asymptotic joint throughput of a pair of paths. The research results of the paper lay an ideological and theoretical foundation for further exploring more general methods that can improve the orderly utilization of network resources. "
