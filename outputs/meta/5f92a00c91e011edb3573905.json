  "title": "On the numerical solution to an inverse medium problem",
  "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with the inverse medium problem of determining the location and shape of penetrable scattering objects from measurements of the scattered field. We study a sampling indicator function for recovering the scattering object in a fast and robust way. A flexibility of this indicator function is that it is applicable to data measured in near-field regime or far-field regime. The implementation of the function is simple and does not involve solving any ill-posed problems. The resolution analysis and stability estimate of the indicator function are investigated using the factorization analysis of the far-field operator along with the Funk-Hecke formula. The performance of the method is verified on both simulated and experimental data. "
