  "abstract": "  This paper focuses on the information freshness of finite-state Markov sources, using the uncertainty of information (UoI) as the performance metric. Measured by Shannon's entropy, UoI can capture not only the transition dynamics of the Markov source but also the different evolutions of information quality caused by the different values of the last observation. We consider an information update system with M finite-state Markov sources transmitting information to a remote monitor via m communication channels. Our goal is to explore the optimal scheduling policy to minimize the sum-UoI of the Markov sources. The problem is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB). We relax the RMAB and then decouple the relaxed problem into M single bandit problems. Analyzing the single bandit problem provides useful properties with which the relaxed problem reduces to maximizing a concave and piecewise linear function, allowing us to develop a gradient method to solve the relaxed problem and obtain its optimal policy. By rounding up the optimal policy for the relaxed problem, we obtain an index policy for the original RMAB problem. Notably, the proposed index policy is universal in the sense that it applies to general RMABs with bounded cost functions. "
