  "title": "Secure access system using signature verification over tablet PC",
  "abstract": "  Low-cost portable devices capable of capturing signature signals are being increasingly used. Additionally, the social and legal acceptance of the written signature for authentication purposes is opening a range of new applications. We describe a highly versatile and scalable prototype for Web-based secure access using signature verification. The proposed architecture can be easily extended to work with different kinds of sensors and large-scale databases. Several remarks are also given on security and privacy of network-based signature verification. "
