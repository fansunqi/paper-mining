  "abstract": "  We prove a linearity theorem for an extension of linear logic with addition and multiplication by a scalar: the proofs of some propositions in this logic are linear in the algebraic sense. This work is part of a wider research program that aims at defining a logic whose proof language is a quantum programming language. "
