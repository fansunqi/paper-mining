  "abstract": "  In recent years, renewable energy resources have accounted for an increasing share of electricity energy.Among them, photovoltaic (PV) power generation has received broad attention due to its economic and environmental benefits.Accurate PV generation forecasts can reduce power dispatch from the grid, thus increasing the supplier's profit in the day-ahead electricity market.The power system of a PV site is affected by solar radiation, PV plant properties and meteorological factors, resulting in uncertainty in its power output.This study used multiple seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (MSTL) and temporal fusion transformer (TFT) to perform day-ahead PV prediction on the desert knowledge Australia solar centre (DKASC) dataset.We compare the decomposition algorithms (VMD, EEMD and VMD-EEMD) and prediction models (BP, LSTM and XGBoost, etc.) which are commonly used in PV prediction presently.The results show that the MSTL-TFT method is more accurate than the aforementioned methods, which have noticeable improvement compared to other recent day-ahead PV predictions on desert knowledge Australia solar centre (DKASC).
