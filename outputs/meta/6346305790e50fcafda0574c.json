  "title": "Smart Hybrid Beamforming and Pilot Assignment for 6G Cell-Free Massive\n  MIMO",
  "abstract": "  This paper investigates Cell-Free massive MIMO networks, where each access point (AP) is equipped with a hybrid transceiver, reducing the complexity and cost compared to a fully digital transceiver. Asymptotic approximations for the spectral efficiency are derived for uplink and downlink. Capitalizing on these expressions, a max-min problem is formulated to optimize the (i) analog beamformer at the APs and (ii) pilot assignment. Simulations show that the optimization of these variables substantially increases the network performance. "
