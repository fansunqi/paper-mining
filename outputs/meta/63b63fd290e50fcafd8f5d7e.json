  "title": "COVID-Net USPro: An Open-Source Explainable Few-Shot Deep Prototypical\n  Network to Monitor and Detect COVID-19 Infection from Point-of-Care\n  Ultrasound Images",
  "abstract": "  As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact many aspects of life and the global healthcare systems, the adoption of rapid and effective screening methods to prevent further spread of the virus and lessen the burden on healthcare providers is a necessity. As a cheap and widely accessible medical image modality, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging allows radiologists to identify symptoms and assess severity through visual inspection of the chest ultrasound images. Combined with the recent advancements in computer science, applications of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis have shown promising results, demonstrating that artificial intelligence-based solutions can accelerate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and lower the burden on healthcare professionals. However, the lack of a huge amount of well-annotated data poses a challenge in building effective deep neural networks in the case of novel diseases and pandemics. Motivated by this, we present COVID-Net USPro, an explainable few-shot deep prototypical network, that monitors and detects COVID-19 positive cases with high precision and recall from minimal ultrasound images. COVID-Net USPro achieves 99.65% overall accuracy, 99.7% recall and 99.67% precision for COVID-19 positive cases when trained with only 5 shots. The analytic pipeline and results were verified by our contributing clinician with extensive experience in POCUS interpretation, ensuring that the network makes decisions based on actual patterns. "
