  "abstract": "  We describe the system used by our team for the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2022 (VoxSRC 2022) in the speaker diarization track. Our solution was designed around a new combination of voice activity detection algorithms that uses the strengths of several systems. We introduce a novel multi stream approach with a decision protocol based on classifiers entropy. We called this method a multi-stream voice activity detection and used it with standard baseline diarization embeddings, clustering and resegmentation. With this work, we successfully demonstrated that using a strong baseline and working only on voice activity detection, one can achieved close to state-of-theart results. "
