  "title": "GA-Aided Directivity in Volumetric and Planar Massive-Antenna Array\n  Design",
  "abstract": "  The problem of directivity enhancement, leading to the increase in the directivity gain over a certain desired angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), is considered in this work. A new formulation of the volumetric array directivity problem is proposed using the rectangular coordinates to describe each antenna element and the desired azimuth and elevation angles with a general element pattern. Such a directivity problem is formulated to find the optimal minimum distance between the antenna elements $d_\\text{min}$ aiming to achieve as high directivity gains as possible. {An expedited implementation method is developed to place the antenna elements in a distinctive plane dependent on ($\\theta_0$; $\\phi_0$). A novel concept on optimizing directivity for the uniform planar array (OUPA) is introduced to find a quasi-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem with low complexity. This solution is reached by deploying the proposed successive evaluation and validation (SEV) method. {Moreover, the genetic} algorithm (GA) method was deployed to find the directivity optimization solution expeditiously. For a small number of antenna elements {, typically $N\\in [4,\\dots, 9]$,} the achievable directivity by GA optimization demonstrates gains of $\\sim 3$ dBi compared with the traditional beamforming technique, using steering vector for uniform linear arrays (ULA) and uniform circular arrays (UCA), while gains of $\\sim1.5$ dBi are attained when compared with an improved UCA directivity method. For a larger number of antenna elements {, two improved GA procedures, namely GA-{\\it marginal} and GA-{\\it stall}, were} proposed and compared with the OUPA method. OUPA also indicates promising directivity gains surpassing $30$ dBi for massive MIMO scenarios. "
