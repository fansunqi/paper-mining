  "abstract": "  Architectural design contexts contain a set of factors that influence software application development. Among them, organizational design contexts consist of high-level company concerns and how it is structured, for example, stakeholders and development schedule, heavily impacting design considerations. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), as a vital concept in the Web3 space, is an organization constructed by automatically executed rules such as via smart contracts, holding features of the permissionless committee, transparent proposals, and fair contribution by stakeholders. In this work, we conduct a systematic literature review to summarize how DAO is structured as well as explore its benefits&challenges in Web3 applications. "
