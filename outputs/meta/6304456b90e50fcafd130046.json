  "abstract": "  Permutation codes and multi-permutation codes have been widely considered due to their various applications, especially in flash memory. In this paper, we consider permutation codes and multi-permutation codes against a burst of stable deletions. In particular, we propose a construction of permutation codes correcting a burst stable deletion of length $s$, with redundancy $\\log n+ 2\\log \\log n+O(1)$. Compared to the previous known results, our improvement relies on a different strategy to retrieve the missing symbol on the first row of the array representation of a permutation. We also generalize our constructions for multi-permutations and the variable length burst model. Furthermore, we propose a linear-time encoder with optimal redundancy for single stable deletion correcting permutation codes. "
