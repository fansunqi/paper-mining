  "title": "Fast spline detection in high density microscopy data",
  "abstract": "  Computer-aided analysis of biological microscopy data has seen a massive improvement with the utilization of general-purpose deep learning techniques. Yet, in microscopy studies of multi-organism systems, the problem of collision and overlap remains challenging. This is particularly true for systems composed of slender bodies such as crawling nematodes, swimming spermatozoa, or the beating of eukaryotic or prokaryotic flagella. Here, we develop a novel end-to-end deep learning approach to extract precise shape trajectories of generally motile and overlapping splines. Our method works in low resolution settings where feature keypoints are hard to define and detect. Detection is fast and we demonstrate the ability to track thousands of overlapping organisms simultaneously. While our approach is agnostic to area of application, we present it in the setting of and exemplify its usability on dense experiments of crawling Caenorhabditis elegans. The model training is achieved purely on synthetic data, utilizing a physics-based model for nematode motility, and we demonstrate the model's ability to generalize from simulations to experimental videos.
