  "title": "Bounds for a alpha-eigenvalues",
  "abstract": "  Let G be a graph with adjacency matrix A(G) and degree diagonal matrix D(G). In 2017, Nikiforov [1] defined the matrix Aalpha(G), as a convex combination of A(G) and D(G), the following way, Aalpha(G) = alpha A(G) + (1 - alpha)D(G), where alpha belongs to [0,1]. In this paper, we present some new upper and lower bounds for the largest, second largest, and smallest eigenvalue of the Aalpha-matrix. Moreover, extremal graphs attaining some of these bounds are characterized "
