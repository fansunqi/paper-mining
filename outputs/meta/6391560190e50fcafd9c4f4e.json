  "title": "Planar #CSP Equality Corresponds to Quantum Isomorphism -- A Holant\n  Viewpoint",
  "abstract": "  Recently, Man\\v{c}inska and Roberson proved that two graphs $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from all planar graphs. We extend this result to planar #CSP with any pair of sets $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}'$ of real-valued, arbitrary-arity constraint functions. Graph homomorphism is the special case where each of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}'$ contains a single symmetric 0-1-valued binary constraint function. Our treatment uses the framework of planar Holant problems. To prove that quantum isomorphic constraint function sets give the same value on any planar #CSP instance, we apply a novel form of holographic transformation of Valiant, using the quantum permutation matrix $\\mathcal{U}$ defining the quantum isomorphism. Due to the noncommutativity of $\\mathcal{U}$'s entries, it turns out that this form of holographic transformation is only applicable to planar Holant. To prove the converse, we introduce the quantum automorphism group Qut$(\\mathcal{F})$ of a set of constraint functions $\\mathcal{F}$, and characterize the intertwiners of Qut$(\\mathcal{F})$ as the signature matrices of planar Holant$(\\mathcal{F}\\,|\\,\\mathcal{EQ})$ quantum gadgets. Then we define a new notion of (projective) connectivity for constraint functions and reduce arity while preserving the quantum automorphism group. Finally, to address the challenges posed by generalizing from 0-1 valued to real-valued constraint functions, we adapt a technique of Lov\\'asz in the classical setting for isomorphisms of real-weighted graphs to the setting of quantum isomorphisms.
