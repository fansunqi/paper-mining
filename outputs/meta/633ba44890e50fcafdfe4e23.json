  "title": "Saving the Limping: Fault-tolerant Quadruped Locomotion via\n  Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "  Modern quadrupeds are skillful in traversing or even sprinting on uneven terrains in a remote uncontrolled environment. However, survival in the wild requires not only maneuverability, but also the ability to handle potential critical hardware failures. How to grant such ability to quadrupeds is rarely investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to train and test hardware fault-tolerant controllers for quadruped locomotion, both in the simulation and physical world. We adopt the teacher-student reinforcement learning framework to train the controller with close-to-reality joint-locking failure in the simulation, which can be zero-shot transferred to the physical robot without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our fault-tolerant controller can efficiently lead a quadruped stably when it faces joint failure during locomotion. "
