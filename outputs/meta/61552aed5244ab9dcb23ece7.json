  "abstract": "  In this paper we discuss the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the exemplary industrial use case of the two-dimensional commissioning problem in a high-bay storage, which essentially can be phrased as an instance of Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We investigate the mlrose library that provides an TSP optimizer based on various heuristic optimization techniques. Our focus is on two methods, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing (HC), which are provided by mlrose. We present improvements for both methods that yield shorter tour lengths, by moderately exploiting the problem structure of TSP. That is, the proposed improvements have a generic character and are not limited to TSP only. "
