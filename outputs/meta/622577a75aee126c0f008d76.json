  "abstract": "  Multimode fibers hold great promise to advance data rates in optical communications but come with the challenge to compensate for modal crosstalk and mode-dependent losses, resulting in strong distortions. The holographic measurement of the transmission matrix enables not only correcting distortions but also harnessing these effects for creating a confidential data connection between legitimate communication parties, Alice and Bob. The feasibility of this physical-layer-security-based approach is demonstrated experimentally for the first time on a multimode fiber link to which the eavesdropper Eve is physically coupled. Once the proper structured light field is launched at Alice's side, the message can be delivered to Bob, and, simultaneously, the decipherment for an illegitimate wiretapper Eve is destroyed. Within a real communication scenario, we implement wiretap codes and demonstrate confidentiality by quantifying the level of secrecy. Compared to an uncoded data transmission, the amount of securely exchanged data is enhanced by a factor of 538. The complex light transportation phenomena that have long been considered limiting and have restricted the widespread use of multimode fiber are exploited for opening new perspectives on information security in spatial multiplexing communication systems.
