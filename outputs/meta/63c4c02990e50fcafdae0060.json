  "abstract": "Cops and Robber is a family of two-player games played on graphs in which one\nplayer controls a number of cops and the other player controls a robber. In\nalternating turns, each player moves (all) their figures. The cops try to\ncapture the robber while the latter tries to flee indefinitely. In this paper\nwe consider a variant of the game played on a planar graph where the robber\nmoves between adjacent vertices while the cops move between adjacent faces. The\ncops capture the robber if they occupy all incident faces. We prove that a\nconstant number of cops suffices to capture the robber on any planar graph of\nmaximum degree \u0394 if and only if \u0394\u2264 4."
