  "title": "Naturalistic Static Program Analysis",
  "abstract": "  Static program analysis development is a non-trivial and time-consuming task. We present a framework through which developers can define static program analyses in natural language. We show the application of this framework to identify cryptography misuses in Java programs, and we discuss how it facilitates static program analysis development for developers. "
