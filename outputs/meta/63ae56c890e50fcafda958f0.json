  "title": "Toward Integrated Sensing and Communications in IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi\n  Networks",
  "abstract": "  As Wi-Fi becomes ubiquitous in public and private spaces, it becomes natural to leverage its intrinsic ability to sense the surrounding environment to implement groundbreaking wireless sensing applications such as human presence detection, activity recognition, and object tracking. For this reason, the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group is defining the appropriate modifications to existing Wi-Fi standards to enhance sensing capabilities through 802.11-compliant devices. However, the new standard is expected to leave the specific sensing algorithms open to implementation. To fill this gap, this article explores the practical implications of integrating sensing into Wi-Fi networks. We provide an overview of the physical and medium access control layers sensing enablers, together with the application layer perspective. We analyze the impact of communication parameters on sensing performance and detail the main research challenges. To make our evaluation replicable, we pledge to release all of our dataset and code to the community. "
