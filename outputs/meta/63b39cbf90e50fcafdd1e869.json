  "title": "Polynomial representation of additive cyclic codes and new quantum codes",
  "abstract": "  We give a polynomial representation for additive cyclic codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. This representation will be applied to uniquely present each additive cyclic code by at most two generator polynomials. We determine the generator polynomials of all different additive cyclic codes. A minimum distance lower bound for additive cyclic codes will also be provided using linear cyclic codes over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. We classify all the symplectic self-dual, self-orthogonal, and nearly self-orthogonal additive cyclic codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Finally, we present ten record-breaking binary quantum codes after applying a quantum construction to self-orthogonal and nearly self-orthogonal additive cyclic codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{4}$. "
