  "title": "Automata and one-dimensional TQFTs with defects",
  "abstract": "  This paper explains how any nondeterministic automaton for a regular language $L$ gives rise to a one-dimensional oriented Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) with inner endpoints and zero-dimensional defects labelled by letters of the alphabet for $L$. The TQFT is defined over the Boolean semiring $\\mathbb{B}$. Different automata for a fixed language $L$ produce TQFTs that differ by their values on decorated circles, while the values on decorated intervals are described by the language $L$. The language $L$ and the TQFT associated to an automaton can be given a path integral interpretation.   In this TQFT the state space of a one-point 0-manifold is a free module over $\\mathbb{B}$ with the basis of states of the automaton. Replacing a free module by a finite projective $\\mathbb{B}$-module $P$ allows to generalize automata and this type of TQFT to a structure where defects act on open subsets of a finite topological space. Intersection of open subsets induces a multiplication on $P$ allowing to extend the TQFT to a TQFT for one-dimensional foams (oriented graphs with defects modulo a suitable equivalence relation).   A linear version of these constructions is also explained, with the Boolean semiring replaced by a commutative ring. "
