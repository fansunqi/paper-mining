  "abstract": "  We study power-set operations on classes of trees and tree algebras. Our main result consists of a distributive law between the tree monad and the upwards-closed power-set monad, in the case where all trees are assumed to be linear. For non-linear ones, we prove that such a distributive law does not exist. "
