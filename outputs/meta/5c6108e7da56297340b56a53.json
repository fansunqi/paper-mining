  "abstract": "  With the rapid development of internet technologies, social networks, and other related areas, user authentication becomes more and more important to protect the data of users. Password authentication is one of the widely used methods to achieve authentication for legal users and defense against intruders. There have been many password-cracking methods developed during the past years, and people have been designing countermeasures against password cracking all the time. However, we find that the survey work on password cracking research has not been done very much. This paper is mainly to give a brief review of the password cracking methods, import technologies of password cracking, and the countermeasures against password cracking that are usually designed at two stages including the password design stage (e.g. user education, dynamic password, use of tokens, computer generations) and after the design (e.g. reactive password checking, proactive password checking, password encryption, access control). The main objective of this work is to offer the abecedarian IT security professionals and the common audiences some knowledge about computer security and password cracking and promote the development of this area.
