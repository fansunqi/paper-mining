  "abstract": "  Image captioning is currently a challenging task that requires the ability to both understand visual information and use human language to describe this visual information in the image. In this paper, we propose an efficient way to improve the image understanding ability of transformer-based method by extending Object Relation Transformer architecture with Attention on Attention mechanism. Experiments on the VieCap4H dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms its original structure on both the public test and private test of the Image Captioning shared task held by VLSP.
