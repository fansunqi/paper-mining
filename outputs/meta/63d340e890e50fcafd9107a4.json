  "title": "The Role of Digital Agriculture in Transforming Rural Areas into Smart\n  Villages",
  "abstract": "  From the perspective of any nation, rural areas generally present a comparable set of problems, such as a lack of proper health care, education, living conditions, wages, and market opportunities. Some nations have created and developed the concept of smart villages during the previous few decades, which effectively addresses these issues. The landscape of traditional agriculture has been radically altered by digital agriculture, which has also had a positive economic impact on farmers and those who live in rural regions by ensuring an increase in agricultural production. We explored current issues in rural areas, and the consequences of smart village applications, and then illustrate our concept of smart village from recent examples of how emerging digital agriculture trends contribute to improving agricultural production in this chapter.
