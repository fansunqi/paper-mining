  "abstract": "  We present in this paper an algorithm for exchanging session keys, coupled with an hashing encryption module. We show schemes designed for their potential invulnerability to classical and quantum attacks. In turn, if the parameters included were appropriate, brute-force attacks exceed the (five) security levels used in the NIST competition of new post-quantum standards. The original idea consists of products of rectangular matrices in Zp as public values and whose factorization is provably an NP-complete problem. We present running times as a function of the explored parameters and their link with operational safety. To our knowledge there are no classical and quantum attacks of polynomial complexity available at hand, remaining only the systematic exploration of the private-key space. "
