  "abstract": "  Large-scale data missing is a challenging problem in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Many studies have been carried out to impute large-scale traffic data by considering their spatiotemporal correlations at a network level. In existing traffic data imputations, however, rich semantic information of a road network has been largely ignored when capturing network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. This study proposes a Graph Transformer for Traffic Data Imputation (GT-TDI) model to impute large-scale traffic data with spatiotemporal semantic understanding of a road network. Specifically, the proposed model introduces semantic descriptions consisting of network-wide spatial and temporal information of traffic data to help the GT-TDI model capture spatiotemporal correlations at a network level. The proposed model takes incomplete data, the social connectivity of sensors, and semantic descriptions as input to perform imputation tasks with the help of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer. On the PeMS freeway dataset, extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed GT-TDI model with conventional methods, tensor factorization methods, and deep learning-based methods. The results show that the proposed GT-TDI outperforms existing methods in complex missing patterns and diverse missing rates. The code of the GT-TDI model will be available at https://github.com/KP-Zhang/GT-TDI. "
