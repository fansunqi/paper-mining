  "abstract": "  The complexity of the data generated by (magneto)-hydrodynamic (HD/MHD) simulations requires advanced tools for their analysis and visualization. The dramatic improvements in virtual reality (VR) technologies have inspired us to seek the long-term goal of creating VR tools for scientific model analysis and visualization that would allow researchers to study and perform data analysis on their models within an immersive environment. Here, we report the results obtained at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo in the development of these tools, which would allow for the exploration of 3D models interactively, resulting in highly detailed analysis that cannot be performed with traditional data visualization and analysis platforms. Additionally, these VR-based tools offer the ability to produce high-impact VR content for efficient audience engagement and awareness. "
