  "title": "On Parameter Estimation in Unobserved Components Models subject to\n  Linear Inequality Constraints",
  "abstract": "  We propose a new \\textit{quadratic programming-based} method of approximating a nonstandard density using a multivariate Gaussian density. Such nonstandard densities usually arise while developing posterior samplers for unobserved components models involving inequality constraints on the parameters. For instance, Chan et al. (2016) provided a new model of trend inflation with linear inequality constraints on the stochastic trend. We implemented the proposed quadratic programming-based method for this model and compared it to the existing approximation. We observed that the proposed method works as well as the existing approximation in terms of the final trend estimates while achieving gains in terms of sample efficiency. "
