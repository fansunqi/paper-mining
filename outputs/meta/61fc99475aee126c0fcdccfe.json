  "title": "Noisy Sorting Capacity",
  "abstract": "  Sorting is the task of ordering $n$ elements using pairwise comparisons. It is well known that $m=\\Theta(n\\log n)$ comparisons are both necessary and sufficient when the outcomes of the comparisons are observed with no noise. In this paper, we study the sorting problem in the presence of noise. Unlike the common approach in the literature which aims to minimize the number of pairwise comparisons $m$ to achieve a given desired error probability, we consider randomized algorithms with expected number of queries $\\mathsf{E}[M]$ and aim at characterizing the maximal ratio $\\frac{n\\log n}{\\mathsf{E}[M]}$ such that the ordering of the elements can be estimated with a vanishing error probability asymptotically. The maximal ratio is referred to as the noisy sorting capacity. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the noisy sorting capacity. We establish two lower bounds, one for fixed-length algorithms and one for variable-length algorithms. The proposed algorithms exploit the connection between noisy searching and channel coding with feedback and incorporate the insertion sort algorithm with the Burnashev-Zigangirov algorithm for channel coding with feedback. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the noisy sorting capacity and an upper bound for the achievable rates of algorithms based on insertion sort. "
