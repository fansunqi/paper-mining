  "abstract": "  A multiple model track-before-detect (TBD) particle filter-based approach for detection and tracking of low observable maneuvering objects based on a sequence of image frames in the presence of noise and clutter is briefly studied in this letter. At each time instance after receiving a frame of image, first, some preprocessing approaches are applied to the image. Then, it is sent to the multiple model TBD particle filter for detection and tracking of an object. Performance of the approach is evaluated for detection and tracking of an object in different scenarios including noise and clutter. "
