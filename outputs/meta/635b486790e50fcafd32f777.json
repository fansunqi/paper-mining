  "abstract": "  Quantum computing is fast evolving as a technology due to recent advances in hardware, software, as well as the development of promising applications. To use this technology for solving specific problems, a suitable quantum algorithm has to be determined, the problem has to be encoded in a form suitable for the chosen algorithm, it has to be executed, and the result has to be decoded. To date, each of these tedious and error-prone steps is conducted in a mostly manual fashion. This creates a high entry barrier for using quantum computing -- especially for users with little to no expertise in that domain. In this work, we envision a framework that aims to lower this entry barrier by allowing users to employ quantum computing solutions in an automatic fashion. To this end, interfaces as similar as possible to classical solvers are provided, while the quantum steps of the workflow are shielded from the user as much as possible by a fully automated backend. To demonstrate the feasibility and usability of such a framework, we provide proof-of-concept implementations for two different classes of problems which are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/cda-tum/MQTProblemSolver) as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT). By this, this work provides the foundation for a low-threshold approach realizing quantum computing solutions with no or only moderate expertise in this technology. "
