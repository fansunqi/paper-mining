  "title": "Google's Quantum Supremacy Claim: Data, Documentation, and Discussion",
  "abstract": "  In October 2019, Nature published a paper describing an experiment that took place at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum (computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer. Since September 2019 we have been involved in a long-term project to study various statistical aspects of the Google experiment. We have been trying to gather the relevant data and information in order to reconstruct and verify those parts of the Google experiment that are based on classical computations (except when the required computation is too heavy), and to perform a statistical analysis on the data. This document describes the available data and information for the Google experiment, some main questions in the evaluation of the experiment, and some of our results and plans. "
