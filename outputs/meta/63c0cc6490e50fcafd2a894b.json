  "abstract": "  Blockchain is a linearly linked, distributed, and very robust data structure. Originally proposed as part of the Bitcoin distributed stack, it found a number of applications in a number of fields, most notably in smart contracts, social media, secure IoT, and cryptocurrency mining. It ensures data integrity by distributing strongly encrypted data in widely redundant segments. Each new insertion requires verification and approval by the majority of the users of the blockchain. Both encryption and verification are computationally intensive tasks which cannot be solved with ordinary off-the-shelf CPUs. This has resulted in a renewed scientific interest in secure distributed communication and coordination protocols. Mobile health applications are growing progressively popular and have the enormous advantage of timely diagnosis of certain conditions. However, privacy concerns have been raised as mobile health application by default have access to highly sensitive personal data. This chapter presents concisely how blockchain can be applied to mobile health applications in order to enhance privacy. "
