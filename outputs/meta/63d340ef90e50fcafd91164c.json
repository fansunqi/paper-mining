  "abstract": "  Ransomware is a rapidly evolving type of malware designed to encrypt user files on a device, making them inaccessible in order to exact a ransom. Ransomware attacks resulted in billions of dollars in damages in recent years and are expected to cause hundreds of billions more in the next decade. With current state-of-the-art process-based detectors being heavily susceptible to evasion attacks, no comprehensive solution to this problem is available today. This paper presents Minerva, a new approach to ransomware detection. Unlike current methods focused on identifying ransomware based on process-level behavioral modeling, Minerva detects ransomware by building behavioral profiles of files based on all the operations they receive in a time window. Minerva addresses some of the critical challenges associated with process-based approaches, specifically their vulnerability to complex evasion attacks. Our evaluation of Minerva demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting ransomware attacks, including those that are able to bypass existing defenses. Our results show that Minerva identifies ransomware activity with an average accuracy of 99.45% and an average recall of 99.66%, with 99.97% of ransomware detected within 1 second. "
