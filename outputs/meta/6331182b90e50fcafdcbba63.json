  "abstract": "  The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in material science and engineering (MSE) is becoming increasingly important as AI technology advances. The development of high-performance computing has made it possible to test deep learning (DL) models with significant parameters, providing an opportunity to overcome the limitation of traditional computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), in property prediction. Machine learning (ML)-based methods are faster and more accurate than DFT-based methods. Furthermore, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) have facilitated the generation of chemical compositions of inorganic materials without using crystal structure information. These developments have significantly impacted material engineering (ME) and research. Some of the latest developments in AI in ME herein are reviewed. First, the development of AI in the critical areas of ME, such as in material processing, the study of structure and material property, and measuring the performance of materials in various aspects, is discussed. Then, the significant methods of AI and their uses in MSE, such as graph neural network, generative models, transfer of learning, etc. are discussed. The use of AI to analyze the results from existing analytical instruments is also discussed. Finally, AI's advantages, disadvantages, and future in ME are discussed. "
