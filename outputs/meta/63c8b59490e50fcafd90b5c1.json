  "abstract": "Background and Objective: Vital sign monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit\n(ICU) is crucial for enabling prompt interventions for patients. This\nunderscores the need for an accurate predictive system. Therefore, this study\nproposes a novel deep learning approach for forecasting Heart Rate (HR),\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) in the ICU.\nMethods: We extracted 24,886 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III database which\ncontains data from over 46 thousand patients, to train and test the model.\nThe model proposed in this study, Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic\nModel for Sparse Time Series Forecasting (TDSTF), merges Transformer and\ndiffusion models to forecast vital signs. The TDSTF model showed\nstate-of-the-art performance in predicting vital signs in the ICU,\noutperforming other models' ability to predict distributions of vital signs and\nbeing more computationally efficient. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PingChang818/TDSTF. Results: The results of the study showed\nthat TDSTF achieved a Standardized Average Continuous Ranked Probability Score\n(SACRPS) of 0.4438 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4168, an improvement\nof 18.9% and 34.3% over the best baseline model, respectively. The\ninference speed of TDSTF is more than 17 times faster than the best baseline\nmodel. Conclusion: TDSTF is an effective and efficient solution for forecasting\nvital signs in the ICU, and it shows a significant improvement compared to\nother models in the field."
