  "abstract": "A matroid M is an ordered pair (E,I), where E is a finite set called\nthe ground set and a collection I\u2282 2^E called the independent sets\nwhich satisfy the conditions: (I1) \u2205\u2208 I, (I2) I'\u2282 I \u2208 I\nimplies I'\u2208 I, and (I3) I_1,I_2 \u2208 I and |I_1| < |I_2| implies that\nthere is an e\u2208 I_2 such that I_1\u222a{e}\u2208 I. The rank rank(M) of a\nmatroid M is the maximum size of an independent set. We say that a matroid\nM=(E,I) is representable over the reals if there is a map \u03c6 : E\n\u2192\u211d^rank(M) such that I\u2208 I if and only if\n\u03c6(I) forms a linearly independent set.\n  We study the problem of matroid realizability over the reals. Given a matroid\nM, we ask whether there is a set of points in the Euclidean space\nrepresenting M. We show that matroid realizability is \u2203\u211d-complete, already for matroids of rank 3. The complexity class \u2203\u211d can be defined as the family of algorithmic problems that is\npolynomial-time is equivalent to determining if a multivariate polynomial with\nintegers coefficients has a real root.\n  Our methods are similar to previous methods from the literature. Yet, the\nresult itself was never pointed out and there is no proof readily available in\nthe language of computer science."
