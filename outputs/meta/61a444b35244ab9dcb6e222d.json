  "abstract": "  Task and motion planning problems in robotics combine symbolic planning over discrete task variables with motion optimization over continuous state and action variables. Recent works such as PDDLStream have focused on optimistic planning with an incrementally growing set of objects until a feasible trajectory is found. However, this set is exhaustively expanded in a breadth-first manner, regardless of the logical and geometric structure of the problem at hand, which makes long-horizon reasoning with large numbers of objects prohibitively time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a geometrically informed symbolic planner that expands the set of objects and facts in a best-first manner, prioritized by a Graph Neural Network that is learned from prior search computations. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of problems and demonstrate an improved ability to plan in difficult scenarios. We also apply our algorithm on a 7DOF robotic arm in block-stacking manipulation tasks. "
