  "abstract": "  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have steadily gained attention to overcome the harsh propagation loss and blockage issue of millimeter-wave communication. However, UAV communication systems suffer from energy consumption, which limits the flying time of UAVs. In this paper, we propose several UAV energy consumption minimization techniques through the aid of multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In specific, we introduce a tractable model to effectively capture the characteristics of multiple IRSs and multiple user equipments (UEs). Then, we derive a closed form expression for the UE achievable rate, resulting in tractable optimization problems. Accordingly, we effectively solve the optimization problems by adopting the successive convex approximation technique. To compensate for the high complexity of the optimization problems, we propose a low complexity algorithm that has marginal performance loss. In the numerical results, we show that the proposed algorithms can save UAV energy consumption significantly compared to the benchmark with no IRSs, justifying that exploiting the IRSs is indeed favorable to UAV energy consumption minimization.
