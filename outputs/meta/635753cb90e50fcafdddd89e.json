  "title": "Instance-Aware Image Completion",
  "abstract": "  Image completion is a task that aims to fill in the missing region of a masked image with plausible contents. However, existing image completion methods tend to fill in the missing region with the surrounding texture instead of hallucinating a visual instance that is suitable in accordance with the context of the scene. In this work, we propose a novel image completion model, dubbed ImComplete, that hallucinates the missing instance that harmonizes well with - and thus preserves - the original context. ImComplete first adopts a transformer architecture that considers the visible instances and the location of the missing region. Then, ImComplete completes the semantic segmentation masks within the missing region, providing pixel-level semantic and structural guidance. Finally, the image synthesis blocks generate photo-realistic content. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the results in terms of visual quality (LPIPS and FID) and contextual preservation scores (CLIPscore and object detection accuracy) with COCO-panoptic and Visual Genome datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of ImComplete on various natural images. "
