  "abstract": "  End-users are concerned about protecting the privacy of their personal data generated while working on information systems. This extends to both the data they actively provide including personal identification in exchange for products and services as well as its related metadata such as unnecessary access to location. This is where Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) plays a major role by incorporating privacy on the evolving new technologies at the fundamental level. Thus, this paper offers an overview of the privacy-preserving mechanisms under standardization at the IETF including DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTP (DoH) and DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) classified as DNS encryption. The paper also discusses Privacy Pass Protocol and its application in generating Private Access Tokens and Passkeys to replace passwords for authentication at the end-user's devices. To further protect the user privacy at the IP level, Private Relays and MASQUE are discussed. This aims to make designers, implementers and users of the Internet aware about the privacy-related design choices. "
