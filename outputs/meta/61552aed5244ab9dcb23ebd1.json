  "title": "WEDGE: Web-Image Assisted Domain Generalization for Semantic\n  Segmentation",
  "abstract": "  Domain generalization for semantic segmentation is highly demanded in real applications, where a trained model is expected to work well in previously unseen domains. One challenge lies in the lack of data which could cover the diverse distributions of the possible unseen domains for training. In this paper, we propose a WEb-image assisted Domain GEneralization (WEDGE) scheme, which is the first to exploit the diversity of web-crawled images for generalizable semantic segmentation. To explore and exploit the real-world data distributions, we collect a web-crawled dataset which presents large diversity in terms of weather conditions, sites, lighting, camera styles, etc. We also present a method which injects the style representation of the web-crawled data into the source domain on-the-fly during training, which enables the network to experience images of diverse styles with reliable labels for effective training. Moreover, we use the web-crawled dataset with predicted pseudo labels for training to further enhance the capability of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms existing domain generalization techniques. "
