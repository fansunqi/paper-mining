  "abstract": "  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of language models capable of generating text with controllable attributes. While several approaches have been proposed, many of these methods require condition-specific data or significant computational resources. In this study, we propose a novel method called Gamma Sampling, which enables controllable language generation without the need for any training data and maintains a fast generation speed. Gamma Sampling incorporates attribute-related information into the sampling process, effectively guiding the language model to produce text with desired attributes. Our experimental results demonstrate that Gamma Sampling, when applied to GPT2, outperforms representative baselines in terms of diversity, attribute relevance, and overall quality of the generated samples.
