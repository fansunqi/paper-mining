  "abstract": "We consider the matroid prophet inequality problem. This problem has been\nextensively studied in the case of adaptive mechanisms. In particular, there is\na tight 2-competitive mechanism for all matroids.\n  However, it is not known what classes of matroids admit non-adaptive\nmechanisms with constant guarantee. Recently, it was shown that there are\nconstant-competitive non-adaptive mechanisms for graphic matroids. In this\nwork, we show that various known classes of matroids admit constant-competitive\nnon-adaptive mechanisms."
