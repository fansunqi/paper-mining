  "abstract": "  In this research work, we have proposed a thermal tiny-YOLO multi-class object detection (TTYMOD) system as a smart forward sensing system that should remain effective in all weather and harsh environmental conditions using an end-to-end YOLO deep learning framework. It provides enhanced safety and improved awareness features for driver assistance. The system is trained on large-scale thermal public datasets as well as newly gathered novel open-sourced dataset comprising of more than 35,000 distinct thermal frames. For optimal training and convergence of YOLO-v5 tiny network variant on thermal data, we have employed different optimizers which include stochastic decent gradient (SGD), Adam, and its variant AdamW which has an improved implementation of weight decay. The performance of thermally tuned tiny architecture is further evaluated on the public as well as locally gathered test data in diversified and challenging weather and environmental conditions. The efficacy of a thermally tuned nano network is quantified using various qualitative metrics which include mean average precision, frames per second rate, and average inference time. Experimental outcomes show that the network achieved the best mAP of 56.4% with an average inference time/ frame of 4 milliseconds. The study further incorporates optimization of tiny network variant using the TensorFlow Lite quantization tool this is beneficial for the deployment of deep learning architectures on the edge and mobile devices. For this study, we have used a raspberry pi 4 computing board for evaluating the real-time feasibility performance of an optimized version of the thermal object detection network for the automotive sensor suite. The source code, trained and optimized models and complete validation/ testing results are publicly available at https://github.com/MAli-Farooq/Thermal-YOLO-And-Model-Optimization-Using-TensorFlowLite.
