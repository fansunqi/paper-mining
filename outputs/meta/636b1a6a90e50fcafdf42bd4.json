  "abstract": "  The prediction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma therapy response is a clinically challenging and important task in this high-mortality tumour entity. The training of neural networks able to tackle this challenge is impeded by a lack of large datasets and the difficult anatomical localisation of the pancreas. Here, we propose a hybrid deep neural network pipeline to predict tumour response to initial chemotherapy which is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) score, a standardised method for cancer response evaluation by clinicians as well as tumour markers, and clinical evaluation of the patients. We leverage a combination of representation transfer from segmentation to classification, as well as localisation and representation learning. Our approach yields a remarkably data-efficient method able to predict treatment response with a ROC-AUC of 63.7% using only 477 datasets in total. "
