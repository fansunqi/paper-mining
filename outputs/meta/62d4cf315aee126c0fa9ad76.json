  "abstract": "  In this paper we will provide a quantitative analysis of a simple model of the Federal Disaster Assistance policy from the viewpoint of three different stakeholders. This quantitative methodology is new and has applications to other areas such as business and healthcare processes. The stakeholders are interested in process transparency but each has a different opinion on precisely what constitutes transparency. We will also consider three modifications to the Federal Disaster Assistance policy and analyse, from a stakeholder viewpoint, how stakeholder satisfaction changes from process to process. This analysis is used to rank the favourability of four policies with respect to all collective stakeholder preferences. "
