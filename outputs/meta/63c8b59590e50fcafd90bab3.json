  "title": "Two New Upper Bounds for the Maximum k-plex Problem",
  "abstract": "A k-plex in a graph is a vertex set where each vertex is non-adjacent to at\nmost k vertices (including itself) in this set, and the Maximum k-plex Problem\n(MKP) is to find the largest k-plex in the graph. As a practical NP-hard\nproblem, MKP has many important real-world applications, such as the analysis\nof various complex networks. Branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithms are a type of\nwell-studied and effective exact algorithms for MKP. Recent BnB MKP algorithms\ninvolve two kinds of upper bounds based on graph coloring and partition,\nrespectively, that work in different perspectives and thus are complementary\nwith each other. In this paper, we first propose a new coloring-based upper\nbound, termed Relaxed Graph Color Bound (RelaxGCB), that significantly improves\nthe previous coloring-based upper bound. We further propose another new upper\nbound, termed RelaxPUB, that incorporates RelaxGCB and a partition-based upper\nbound in a novel way, making use of their complementarity. We apply RelaxGCB\nand RelaxPUB to state-of-the-art BnB MKP algorithms and produce eight new\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments using diverse k values on hundreds of\ninstances based on dense and massive sparse graphs demonstrate the excellent\nperformance and robustness of our proposed methods."
