  "abstract": "  We prove that even in average case, the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem exhibits an integrality gap of $(1+\\epsilon)$ for $\\epsilon>0$ when the Held-Karp Linear Programming relaxation is augmented by all comb inequalities of bounded size. This implies that large classes of branch-and-cut algorithms take exponential time for the Euclidean TSP, even on random inputs. "
