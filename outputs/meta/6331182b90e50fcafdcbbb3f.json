  "title": "Design of a Multimodal Fingertip Sensor for Dynamic Manipulation",
  "abstract": "  We introduce a spherical fingertip sensor for dynamic manipulation. It is based on barometric pressure and time-of-flight proximity sensors and is low-latency, compact, and physically robust. The sensor uses a trained neural network to estimate the contact location and three-axis contact forces based on data from the pressure sensors, which are embedded within the sensor's sphere of polyurethane rubber. The time-of-flight sensors face in three different outward directions, and an integrated microcontroller samples each of the individual sensors at up to 200 Hz. To quantify the effect of system latency on dynamic manipulation performance, we develop and analyze a metric called the collision impulse ratio and characterize the end-to-end latency of our new sensor. We also present experimental demonstrations with the sensor, including measuring contact transitions, performing coarse mapping, maintaining a contact force with a moving object, and reacting to avoid collisions.
