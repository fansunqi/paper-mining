  "title": "Quantum Split Neural Network Learning using Cross-Channel Pooling",
  "abstract": "  In recent years, the field of quantum science has attracted significant interest across various disciplines, including quantum machine learning, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Among these emerging areas, quantum federated learning (QFL) has gained particular attention due to the integration of quantum neural networks (QNNs) with traditional federated learning (FL) techniques. In this study, a novel approach entitled quantum split learning (QSL) is presented, which represents an advanced extension of classical split learning. Previous research in classical computing has demonstrated numerous advantages of split learning, such as accelerated convergence, reduced communication costs, and enhanced privacy protection. To maximize the potential of QSL, cross-channel pooling is introduced, a technique that capitalizes on the distinctive properties of quantum state tomography facilitated by QNNs. Through rigorous numerical analysis, evidence is provided that QSL not only achieves a 1.64\\% higher top-1 accuracy compared to QFL but also demonstrates robust privacy preservation in the context of the MNIST classification task.
