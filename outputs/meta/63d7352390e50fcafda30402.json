  "abstract": "  Deep learning methods dominate short-term high-resolution precipitation nowcasting in terms of prediction error. However, their operational usability is limited by difficulties explaining dynamics behind the predictions, which are smoothed out and missing the high-frequency features due to optimizing for mean error loss functions. We experiment with hand-engineering of the advection-diffusion differential equation into a PhyCell to introduce more accurate physical prior to a PhyDNet model that disentangles physical and residual dynamics. Results indicate that while PhyCell can learn the intended dynamics, training of PhyDNet remains driven by loss optimization, resulting in a model with the same prediction capabilities. "
