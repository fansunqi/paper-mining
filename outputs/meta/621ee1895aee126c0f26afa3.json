  "abstract": "  This document provides full details of second-order partial derivatives of rigid-body inverse dynamics. Several properties and identities using an extension of Spatial Vector Algebra for tensorial use are listed, along with their detailed derivations. Using those, the expressions for second-order derivatives are derived step-by-step in detail. The expressions build upon previous work by the authors on first-order partial derivatives of inverse dynamics. "
