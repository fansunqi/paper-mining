  "title": "Supervisory Control for Dynamic Feature Configuration in Product Lines",
  "abstract": "  In this paper a framework for engineering supervisory controllers for product lines with dynamic feature configuration is proposed. The variability in valid configurations is described by a feature model. Behavior of system components is achieved using (extended) finite automata and both behavioral and dynamic configuration constraints are expressed by means of requirements as is common in supervisory control theory. Supervisory controller synthesis is applied to compute a behavioral model in which the requirements are adhered to. For the challenges that arise in this setting, multiple solutions are discussed. The solutions are exemplified in the CIF toolset using a model of a coffee machine. A use case of the much larger Body Comfort System product line is performed to showcase feasibility for industrial-sized systems. "
