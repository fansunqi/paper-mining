  "title": "A Quantum EL Theorem",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we prove a quantum version of the EL Theorem. It states that non-exotic projections of large rank must have simple quantum states in their images. A consequence to this is there is no way to communicate a quantum source with corresponding large enough von Neumann entropy without using simple quantum states. "
