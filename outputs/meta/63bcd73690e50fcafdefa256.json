  "title": "Construction of Optimal Binary Z-Complementary Code Sets with New\n  Lengths",
  "abstract": "  Z-complementary code sets (ZCCSs) are used in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems, for interference-free communication over multiuser and quasi-asynchronous environments.   In this letter, we propose three new constructions of optimal binary $\\left(R2^{k+1},2^{k+1}, R\\gamma,\\gamma\\right)$-ZCCS, $\\left(R2^{k+1},2^{k+1}, R2^{m_{2}},2^{m_{2}}\\right)$-ZCCS and $\\left(2^{k+1},2^{k+1},3\\gamma,2\\gamma\\right)$-ZCCS   based on generalized Boolean functions (GBFs), where $\\gamma=2^{m_{1}-1}+2^{m_{1}-3}, m_{1}\\geq 5, k\\geq 1,m_{2}\\geq 1$ and $R$ is any even number. The proposed ZCCSs cover many unreported lengths and large set sizes. "
