  "abstract": "  This study aimed to improve the surface defect detection accuracy of ZrO2 ceramic bearing balls. Combined with the noise damage of the image samples, a surface defect detection method for ZrO2 ceramic bearing balls based on cartoon-texture decomposition model was proposed. Building a ZrO2 ceramic bearing ball surface defect detection system. The ZrO2 ceramic bearing ball surface defect image was decomposed by using the Gaussian curvature model and the decomposed image layer was filtered by using Winner filter and wavelet value domain filter. Then they were fused into a clear and undamaged ZrO2 ceramic bearing ball surface defect image and detected. The experimental results show that the image denoising method of ZrO2 ceramic bearing ball surface defect based on cartoon-texture decomposition model can denoise while retaining the image details. The PSNR of image is 34.1 dB, the SSIM is 0.9476, the detection accuracy is 95.8%, and the detection speed of a single defect image is 191ms / img. This method can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of ZrO2 ceramic bearing ball surface defect detection. "
