  "title": "Brain PET Synthesis from MRI Using Joint Probability Distribution of\n  Diffusion Model at Ultrahigh Fields",
  "abstract": "  MRI and PET are important modalities and can provide complementary information for the diagnosis of brain diseases because MRI can provide structural information of brain and PET can obtain functional information of brain. However, PET is usually missing. Especially, simultaneous PET and MRI imaging at ultrahigh field is not achievable in the current. Thus, synthetic PET using MRI at ultrahigh field is essential. In this paper, we synthetic PET using MRI as a guide by joint probability distribution of diffusion model (JPDDM). Meanwhile, We utilized our model in Ultrahigh Fields. "
