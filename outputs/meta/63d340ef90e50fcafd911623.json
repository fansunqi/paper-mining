  "abstract": "  The generalization power of the pre-trained model is the key for few-shot deep learning. Dropout is a regularization technique used in traditional deep learning methods. In this paper, we explore the power of dropout on few-shot learning and provide some insights about how to use it. Extensive experiments on the few-shot object detection and few-shot image classification datasets, i.e., Pascal VOC, MS COCO, CUB, and mini-ImageNet, validate the effectiveness of our method. "
