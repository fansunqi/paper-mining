  "title": "Learning Gradients of Convex Functions with Monotone Gradient Networks",
  "abstract": "  While much effort has been devoted to deriving and analyzing effective convex formulations of signal processing problems, the gradients of convex functions also have critical applications ranging from gradient-based optimization to optimal transport. Recent works have explored data-driven methods for learning convex objective functions, but learning their monotone gradients is seldom studied. In this work, we propose C-MGN and M-MGN, two monotone gradient neural network architectures for directly learning the gradients of convex functions. We show that, compared to state of the art methods, our networks are easier to train, learn monotone gradient fields more accurately, and use significantly fewer parameters. We further demonstrate their ability to learn optimal transport mappings to augment driving image data. "
