  "title": "Compositional Net Semantics up to Step Net Bisimilarity",
  "abstract": "  Step net bisimilarity \\cite{Gor23} is a truly concurrent behavioral equivalence for finite Petri nets, which is defined as a smooth generalization of standard step bisimilarity \\cite{NT84} on Petri nets, but with the property of relating markings (of the same size only) generating the same partial orders of events. The process algebra FNM \\cite{Gor17} truly represents all (and only) the finite Petri nets, up to isomorphism. We prove that step net bisimilarity is a congruence w.r.t. the FMN operators, In this way, we have defined a compositional semantics, fully respecting causality and the branching structure of systems, for the class of all the finite Petri nets.
