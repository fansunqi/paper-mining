  "abstract": "  Amodal recognition is the ability of the system to detect occluded objects. Most SOTA Visual Recognition systems lack the ability to perform amodal recognition. Few studies have achieved amodal recognition through passive prediction or embodied recognition approaches. However, these approaches suffer from challenges in real-world applications, such as dynamic obstacles. We propose SeekNet, an improved optimization method for amodal recognition through embodied visual recognition. Additionally, we implement SeekNet for social robots, where there are multiple interactions with crowded pedestrians. We also demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm on occluded human detection and tracking over other baselines. Additionally, we set up a multi-robot environment with SeekNet to identify and track visual disease markers for airborne disease in crowded areas. We conduct our experiments in a simulated indoor environment and show that our method enhances the overall accuracy of the amodal recognition task and achieves the largest improvement in detection accuracy over time in comparison to the baseline approaches.
