  "title": "Quantum Encryption in Phase Space using Displacement Operator for QPSK\n  Data Modulation",
  "abstract": "  In 2020, Kuang and Bettenburg proposed Quantum Public Key Distribution (QPKE) which utilized the randomized phase shift gate. Since then, it has been implemented both theoretically through simulations and experimentally over existing fiber optical networks. QPKE can be compared to an RSA-type scheme but in the optical analogue domain. Later on, it was renamed Quantum Encryption in Phase Space (QEPS) to emphasize the encryption of coherent states in phase space. However, the phase shift gate used in QEPS is limited to data modulation schemes with phase shift keying such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) as it may leak data information in amplitude if applied to quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. Recently, Kuang and Chan proposed a new version of QEPS known as Quantum Encryption in Phase Space with the displacement gate or QEPS-d, which overcomes the limitation of QEPS with the phase shift gate. This was achieved by introducing a reduced displacement operator that ignores the global phase factor, making the reduced displacement operators commutable, thus aiding the implementation at both transmission and reception. Furthermore, any arbitrary displacement operator can be decoupled into a standard QAM modulation with a phase shift modulation, making encryption and decryption easier. This paper demonstrates the simulation of QEPS-d encryption for QPSK data modulation to illustrate how QEPS-d functions. "
