  "abstract": "  Rule-based reasoning is an essential part of human intelligence prominently formalized in artificial intelligence research via logic programs. Describing complex objects as the composition of elementary ones is a common strategy in computer science and science in general. The author has recently introduced the sequential composition of logic programs in the context of logic-based analogical reasoning and learning in logic programming. Motivated by these applications, in this paper we construct a qualitative and algebraic notion of syntactic logic program similarity from sequential decompositions of programs. We then show how similarity can be used to answer queries across different domains via a one-step reduction. In a broader sense, this paper is a further step towards an algebraic theory of logic programming. "
