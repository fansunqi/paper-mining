  "title": "Modeling the Rhythm from Lyrics for Melody Generation of Pop Song",
  "abstract": "  Creating a pop song melody according to pre-written lyrics is a typical practice for composers. A computational model of how lyrics are set as melodies is important for automatic composition systems, but an end-to-end lyric-to-melody model would require enormous amounts of paired training data. To mitigate the data constraints, we adopt a two-stage approach, dividing the task into lyric-to-rhythm and rhythm-to-melody modules. However, the lyric-to-rhythm task is still challenging due to its multimodality. In this paper, we propose a novel lyric-to-rhythm framework that includes part-of-speech tags to achieve better text setting, and a Transformer architecture designed to model long-term syllable-to-note associations. For the rhythm-to-melody task, we adapt a proven chord-conditioned melody Transformer, which has achieved state-of-the-art results. Experiments for Chinese lyric-to-melody generation show that the proposed framework is able to model key characteristics of rhythm and pitch distributions in the dataset, and in a subjective evaluation, the melodies generated by our system were rated as similar to or better than those of a state-of-the-art alternative.
