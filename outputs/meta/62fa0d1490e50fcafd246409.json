  "abstract": "  Collision evaluation is of vital importance in various applications. However, existing methods are either cumbersome to calculate or have a gap with the actual value. In this paper, we propose a zero-gap whole-body collision evaluation which can be formulated as a low dimensional linear program. This evaluation can be solved analytically in O(m) computational time, where m is the total number of the linear inequalities in this linear program. Moreover, the proposed method is efficient in obtaining its gradient, making it easy to apply to optimization-based applications. "
