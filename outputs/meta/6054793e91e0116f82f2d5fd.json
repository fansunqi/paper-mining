  "abstract": "  We introduce magic measures to quantify the nonstabilizerness of multiqubit quantum gates and establish lower bounds on the $T$ count for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we introduce the stabilizer nullity of multi-qubit unitary, which is based on the subgroup of the quotient Pauli group associated with the unitary. This unitary stabilizer nullity extends the state-stabilizer nullity by Beverland et al. to a dynamic version. In particular, we show this nonstabilizerness measure has desirable properties such as subadditivity under composition and additivity under tensor product. Second, we prove that a given unitary's stabilizer nullity is a lower bound for the $T$ count, utilizing the above properties in gate synthesis. Third, we compare the state- and the unitary-stabilizer nullity, proving that the lower bounds for the $T$ count obtained by the unitary-stabilizer nullity are never less than the state-stabilizer nullity. Moreover, we show an explicit $n$-qubit unitary family of unitary-stabilizer nullity $2n$, which implies that its $T$ count is at least $2n$. This gives an example where the bounds derived by the unitary-stabilizer nullity strictly outperform the state-stabilizer nullity by a factor of $2$. We finally showcase the advantages of unitary-stabilizer nullity in estimating the $T$ count of quantum gates with interests. "
