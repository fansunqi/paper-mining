  "abstract": "  Proactive edge association is capable of improving wireless connectivity at the cost of increased handover (HO) frequency and energy consumption, while relying on a large amount of private information sharing required for decision making. In order to improve the connectivity-cost trade-off without privacy leakage, we investigate the privacy-preserving joint edge association and power allocation (JEAPA) problem in the face of the environmental uncertainty and the infeasibility of individual learning. Upon modelling the problem by a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), it is solved by federated multi-agent reinforcement learning (FMARL) through only sharing encrypted training data for federatively learning the policy sought. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution strikes a compelling trade-off, while preserving a higher privacy level than the state-of-the-art solutions. "
