  "title": "An Efficient Semi-Automated Scheme for Infrastructure LiDAR Annotation",
  "abstract": "  Most existing perception systems rely on sensory data acquired from cameras, which perform poorly in low light and adverse weather conditions. To resolve this limitation, we have witnessed advanced LiDAR sensors become popular in perception tasks in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, their usage in traffic monitoring systems is less ubiquitous. We identify two significant obstacles in cost-effectively and efficiently developing such a LiDAR-based traffic monitoring system: (i) public LiDAR datasets are insufficient for supporting perception tasks in infrastructure systems, and (ii) 3D annotations on LiDAR point clouds are time-consuming and expensive. To fill this gap, we present an efficient semi-automated annotation tool that automatically annotates LiDAR sequences with tracking algorithms while offering a fully annotated infrastructure LiDAR dataset -- FLORIDA (Florida LiDAR-based Object Recognition and Intelligent Data Annotation) -- which will be made publicly available. Our advanced annotation tool seamlessly integrates multi-object tracking (MOT), single-object tracking (SOT), and suitable trajectory post-processing techniques. Specifically, we introduce a human-in-the-loop schema in which annotators recursively fix and refine annotations imperfectly predicted by our tool and incrementally add them to the training dataset to obtain better SOT and MOT models. By repeating the process, we significantly increase the overall annotation speed by three to four times and obtain better qualitative annotations than a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The human annotation experiments verify the effectiveness of our annotation tool. In addition, we provide detailed statistics and object detection evaluation results for our dataset in serving as a benchmark for perception tasks at traffic intersections. "
