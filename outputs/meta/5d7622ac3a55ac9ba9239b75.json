  "abstract": "  We present a refinement of the classical alteration method for constructing $H$-free graphs: for suitable edge-probabilities $p$, we show that removing all edges in $H$-copies of the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ does not significantly change the independence number. This differs from earlier alteration approaches of Erd\\H{o}s and Krivelevich, who obtained similar guarantees by removing one edge from each $H$-copy (instead of all of them). We demonstrate the usefulness of our refined alternation method via two applications to online graph Ramsey games, where it enables easier analysis. "
