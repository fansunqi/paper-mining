  "abstract": "  We present proofs of two new families of sum-product identities arising from the cylindric partitions paradigm. Most of the presented expressions, the related sum-product identities, and the ingredients for the proofs were first conjectured by Kanade-Russell in the spirit of Andrews-Schilling-Warnaar identities of the $A_2$ Rogers-Ramanujan type. We follow the footsteps of Kanade-Russell while we alter the computations heavily to accomplish our goals. "
