  "abstract": "  Not only in our country and Asia, but the agriculture sector is also lagging all over the world while using new technologies and innovations. Farmers are not getting the accurate price and compensation of their products because of several reasons. The intermediate persons or say middlemen are controlling the prices and product delivery on their own. Due to lack of education, technological advancement, market knowledge, post-harvesting processes, and middleman involvement, farmers are always deprived of their actual pay and efforts. The use of blockchain technology can help such farmers to automate the process with high trust. We have presented our case study and analysis for the Indian sugarcane farming with data collected from farmers. The system implementation, testing, and result analysis has been shown based on the case study. The overall purpose of our research is to emphasize and motivate the agricultural products and benefit the farmers with the use of blockchain technology. "
