  "title": "Random Planted Forest: a directly interpretable tree ensemble",
  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel interpretable, tree based algorithm for prediction in a regression setting in which each tree in a classical random forest is replaced by a family of planted trees that grow simultaneously. The motivation for our algorithm is to estimate the unknown regression function from a functional decomposition perspective, where each tree corresponds to a function within that decomposition. The maximal order of approximation in the decomposition can be specified or left unlimited. If a first order approximation is chosen, the result is an additive model. In the other extreme case, if the order of approximation is not limited, the resulting model places no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealised version of random planted forests in cases where the maximal order of approximation is low. We show that if the order is smaller than three, the idealised version achieves asymptotically optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor. ode is available on https://github.com/PlantedML/randomPlantedForest "
