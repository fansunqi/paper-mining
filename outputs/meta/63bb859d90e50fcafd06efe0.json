  "title": "Avatar-centred AR Collaborative Mobile Interaction",
  "abstract": "  Interaction with the physical environment and different users is essential to foster a collaborative experience. For this, we propose an interaction based on a central point represented by an Augmented Reality marker in which several users can capture the attention and interact with a virtual avatar. The interface provides different game modes, with various challenges, supporting a collaborative mobile interaction. The system fosters various group interactions with a virtual avatar and enables various tasks with playful and didactic components. "
