  "abstract": "  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have sparked a renewed interest in the research community envisioning future wireless communication networks. In this study, we analyzed the performance of RIS-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication system, where the RIS is partitioned to serve a pair of D2D users. Specifically, closed-form expressions are derived for the upper and lower limits of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). In addition, the performance of the proposed NOMA-based system is also compared with its orthogonal counterpart. Extensive simulation is done to corroborate the analytical findings. The results demonstrate that RIS highly enhances the performance of a NOMA-based D2D network. "
