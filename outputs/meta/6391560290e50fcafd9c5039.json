  "title": "Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference for Time Series",
  "abstract": "  We present a new distribution-free conformal prediction algorithm for sequential data (e.g., time series), called the \\textit{sequential predictive conformal inference} (\\texttt{SPCI}). We specifically account for the nature that time series data are non-exchangeable, and thus many existing conformal prediction algorithms are not applicable. The main idea is to exploit the temporal dependence of non-conformity scores (e.g., prediction residuals); thus, the past residuals contain information about future ones. Then we cast the problem of conformal prediction interval as predicting the quantile of a future residual, given a user-specified point prediction algorithm. Theoretically, we establish asymptotic valid conditional coverage upon extending consistency analyses in quantile regression. Using simulation and real-data experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in interval width of \\texttt{SPCI} compared to other existing methods under the desired empirical coverage. "
