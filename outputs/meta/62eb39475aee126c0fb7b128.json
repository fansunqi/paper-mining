  "abstract": "  The design and launch of large-scale satellite networks create an imminent demand for efficient and delay-minimising routing methods. With the rising number of satellites in such constellations, pre-computing all shortest routes between all satellites and for all times becomes more and more infeasible due to space and time limitations. Even though distributed on-demand routing methods were developed for specific LEO satellite network configurations, they are not suited for increasingly popular mega-constellations based on Walker Delta formations.   The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we introduce a formal model that mathematically captures the time-evolving locations of satellites in a Walker Delta constellation and use it to establish a formula to compute the minimum number of ISL hops between two given satellites. In the second part, we present an on-demand hop-count-based routing algorithm that approximates the optimal path while achieving superior performance compared to classical shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra.
