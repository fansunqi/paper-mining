  "title": "Freeform Islamic Geometric Patterns",
  "abstract": "  Islamic geometric patterns are a rich and venerable ornamental tradition. Many classic designs feature periodic arrangements of rosettes: star shapes surrounded by rings of hexagonal petals. We present a new technique for generating 'freeform' compositions of rosettes: finite designs that freely mix rosettes of unusual sizes while retaining the aesthetics of traditional patterns. We use a circle packing as a scaffolding for developing a patch of polygons and fill each polygon with a motif based on established constructions from Islamic art. "
