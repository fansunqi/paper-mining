  "title": "Two-Dimensional Golay Complementary Array Sets With Arbitrary Lengths\n  for Omnidirectional MIMO Transmission",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents a coding approach for achieving omnidirectional transmission of certain common signals in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) networks such that the received power at any direction in a cell remains constant for any given distance. Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) Golay complementary array set (GCAS) can be used to design optimal massive MIMO precoding matrix so as to achieve omnidirectional transmission due to its complementary autocorrelation property. In this paper, novel constructions of new 2D GCASs with arbitrary array lengths are proposed. Our key idea is to carefully truncate the columns of certain larger arrays generated by 2D generalized Boolean functions. Finally, the power radiation patterns and numerical results are provided to verify the omnidirectional property of the GCAS-based precoding. The error performances of the proposed precoding scheme are presented to validate its superiority over the existing alternatives. "
