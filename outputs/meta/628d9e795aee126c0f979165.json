  "abstract": "  Studies of dynamics on temporal networks often represent the network as a series of \"snapshots,\" static networks active for short durations of time. We argue that successive snapshots can be aggregated if doing so has little effect on the overlying dynamics. We propose a method to compress network chronologies by progressively combining pairs of snapshots whose matrix commutators have the smallest dynamical effect. We apply this method to epidemic modeling on real contact tracing data and find that it allows for significant compression while remaining faithful to the epidemic dynamics. "
