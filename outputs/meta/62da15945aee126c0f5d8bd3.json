  "title": "EC-KitY: Evolutionary Computation Tool Kit in Python with Seamless\n  Machine Learning Integration",
  "abstract": "  EC-KitY is a comprehensive Python library for doing evolutionary computation (EC), licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, and compatible with scikit-learn. Designed with modern software engineering and machine learning integration in mind, EC-KitY can support all popular EC paradigms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, coevolution, evolutionary multi-objective optimization, and more. This paper provides an overview of the package, including the ease of setting up an EC experiment, the architecture, the main features, and a comparison with other libraries. "
