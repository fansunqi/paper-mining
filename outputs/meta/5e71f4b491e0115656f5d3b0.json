  "abstract": "  We investigate the geometric properties of the functions learned by trained ConvNets in the preactivation space of their convolutional layers, by performing an empirical study of hyperplane arrangements induced by a convolutional layer. We introduce statistics over the weights of a trained network to study local arrangements and relate them to the training dynamics. We observe that trained ConvNets show a significant statistical bias towards regular hyperplane configurations. Furthermore, we find that layers showing biased configurations are critical to validation performance for the architectures considered, trained on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet. "
