  "title": "HTTE: A Hybrid Technique For Travel Time Estimation In Sparse Data\n  Environments",
  "abstract": "  Travel time estimation is a critical task, useful to many urban applications at the individual citizen and the stakeholder level. This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm for travel time estimation that leverages historical and sparse real-time trajectory data. Given a path and a departure time we estimate the travel time taking into account the historical information, the real-time trajectory data and the correlations among different road segments. We detect similar road segments using historical trajectories, and use a latent representation to model the similarities. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. "
