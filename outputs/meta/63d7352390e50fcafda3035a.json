  "abstract": "  In this study, we address the problem of optimizing multi-output black-box functions under uncertain environments. We formulate this problem as the estimation of the uncertain Pareto-frontier (PF) of a multi-output Bayesian surrogate model with two types of variables: design variables and environmental variables. We consider this problem within the context of Bayesian optimization (BO) under uncertain environments, where the design variables are controllable, whereas the environmental variables are assumed to be random and not controllable. The challenge of this problem is to robustly estimate the PF when the distribution of the environmental variables is unknown, that is, to estimate the PF when the environmental variables are generated from the worst possible distribution. We propose a method for solving the BO problem by appropriately incorporating the uncertainties of the environmental variables and their probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can find an arbitrarily accurate PF with high probability in a finite number of iterations. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed method through numerical experiments. "
