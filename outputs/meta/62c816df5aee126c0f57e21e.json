  "abstract": "  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique to control wireless propagation environment for enhancing the communication performance cost-effectively. However, the rapidly time-varying channel in high-mobility communication scenarios such as vehicular communication renders it challenging to obtain the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) efficiently for IRS with a large number of reflecting elements. In this paper, we propose a new roadside IRS-aided vehicular communication system to tackle this challenge. Specifically, by exploiting the symmetrical deployment of IRSs with inter-laced equal intervals on both sides of the road and the cooperation among nearby IRS controllers, we propose a new two-stage channel estimation scheme with off-line and online training, respectively, to obtain the static/time-varying CSI required by the proposed low-complexity passive beamforming scheme efficiently. The proposed IRS beamforming and online channel estimation designs leverage the existing uplink pilots in wireless networks and do not require any change of the existing transmission protocol. Moreover, they can be implemented by each of IRS controllers independently, without the need of any real-time feedback from the user's serving BS. Simulation results show that the proposed designs can efficiently achieve the high IRS passive beamforming gain and thus significantly enhance the achievable communication throughput for high-speed vehicular communications.
