  "title": "Abstract Huffman Coding and PIFO Tree Embeddings",
  "abstract": "  Algorithms for deriving Huffman codes and the recently developed algorithm for compiling PIFO trees to trees of fixed shape (Mohan et al. 2022) are similar, but work with different underlying algebraic operations. In this paper, we exploit the monadic structure of prefix codes to create a generalized Huffman algorithm that has these two applications as special cases. "
