  "title": "Hitchhiker: A Quadrotor Aggressively Perching on a Moving Inclined\n  Surface Using Compliant Suction Cup Gripper",
  "abstract": "  Perching on {the surface} of moving objects, like vehicles, could extend the flight {time} and range of quadrotors. Suction cups are usually adopted for {surface attachment} due to their durability and large adhesive force. To seal on {a surfaces}, suction cups {must} be aligned with {the surface} and {possess proper relative tangential velocity}. {However, quadrotors' attitude and relative velocity errors would become significant when the object surface is moving and inclined. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm. The time-optimal aggressive trajectory is efficiently generated through multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain. The velocity errors relative to the moving surface are alleviated.} To further adapt to the residual errors, we design a compliant gripper using self-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism also eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential velocity. {Extensive tests are conducted to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations.} Results demonstrate that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably perch on moving inclined surfaces (up to $1.07m/s$ and $90^\\circ$) with a success rate of $70\\%$ or higher. {The efficacy of the trajectory planner is also validated. Our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential velocities than conventional suction cup grippers.} The success rate increases by 45\\% in dynamic perches. "
