  "abstract": "  We introduce a machine learning-powered course allocation mechanism. Concretely, we extend the state-of-the-art Course Match mechanism with a machine learning-based preference elicitation module. In an iterative, asynchronous manner, this module generates pairwise comparison queries that are tailored to each individual student. Regarding incentives, our machine learning-powered course match (MLCM) mechanism retains the attractive strategyproofness in the large property of Course Match. Regarding welfare, we perform computational experiments using a simulator that was fitted to real-world data. Our results show that, compared to Course Match, MLCM increases average student utility by 4%-9% and minimum student utility by 10%-21%, even with only ten comparison queries. Finally, we highlight the practicability of MLCM and the ease of piloting it for universities currently using Course Match. "
