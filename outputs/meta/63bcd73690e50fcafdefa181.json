  "abstract": "  Customer-centric marketing campaigns generate a large portion of e-commerce website traffic for Walmart. As the scale of customer data grows larger, expanding the marketing audience to reach more customers is becoming more critical for e-commerce companies to drive business growth and bring more value to customers. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient system to expand targeted audience of marketing campaigns, which can handle hundreds of millions of customers. We use a deep learning based embedding model to represent customers and an approximate nearest neighbor search method to quickly find lookalike customers of interest. The model can deal with various business interests by constructing interpretable and meaningful customer similarity metrics. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the great performance of our system and customer embedding model. "
