  "abstract": "  Recently, logo detection has received more and more attention for its wide applications in the multimedia field, such as intellectual property protection, product brand management, and logo duration monitoring. Unlike general object detection, logo detection is a challenging task, especially for small logo objects and large aspect ratio logo objects in the real-world scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Discriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid Network with Guided Anchoring (DSFP-GA), which can address these challenges via aggregating the semantic information and generating different aspect ratio anchor boxes. More specifically, our approach mainly consists of Discriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid (DSFP) and Guided Anchoring (GA). Considering that low-level feature maps that are used to detect small logo objects lack semantic information, we propose the DSFP, which can enrich more discriminative semantic features of low-level feature maps and can achieve better performance on small logo objects. Furthermore, preset anchor boxes are less efficient for detecting large aspect ratio logo objects. We therefore integrate the GA into our method to generate large aspect ratio anchor boxes to mitigate this issue. Extensive experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSFP-GA. Moreover, we further conduct visual analysis and ablation studies to illustrate the advantage of our method in detecting small and large aspect logo objects.
