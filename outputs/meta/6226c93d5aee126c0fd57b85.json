  "abstract": "  This book is a course in Stone-Priestley duality theory, with applications to logic and theoretical computer science. Our target audience are graduate students and researchers in mathematics and computer science. Our aim is to get in a fairly full palette of duality tools as directly and quickly as possible, then to illustrate and further elaborate these tools within the setting of three emblematic applications: semantics of propositional logics, domain theory in logical form, and the theory of profinite monoids for the study of regular languages and automata.
