  "abstract": "  Wildfires are becoming more frequent and their effects more devastating every day. Climate change has directly and indirectly affected the occurrence of these, as well as social phenomena have increased the vulnerability of people. Consequently, and given the inevitable occurrence of these, it is important to have early warning systems that allow a timely and effective response. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and Computer Vision offer an effective and achievable alternative for opportune detection of wildfires and thus reduce the risk of disasters. YOLOv7 offers a simple, fast, and efficient algorithm for training object detection models which can be used in early detection of smoke columns in the initial stage wildfires. The developed model showed promising results, achieving a score of 0.74 in the F1 curve when the confidence level is 0.298, that is, a higher score at lower confidence levels was obtained. This means when the conditions are favorable for false positives. The metrics demonstrates the resilience and effectiveness of the model in detecting smoke columns. "
