  "title": "Near Optimal Adversarial Attack on UCB Bandits",
  "abstract": "  We consider a stochastic multi-arm bandit problem where rewards are subject to adversarial corruption. We propose a novel attack strategy that manipulates a UCB principle into pulling some non-optimal target arm $T - o(T)$ times with a cumulative cost that scales as $\\sqrt{\\log T}$, where $T$ is the number of rounds. We also prove the first lower bound on the cumulative attack cost. Our lower bound matches our upper bound up to $\\log \\log T$ factors, showing our attack to be near optimal. "
