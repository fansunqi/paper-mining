  "abstract": "  Future wireless cellular networks will utilize millimeter-wave and sub-THz frequencies and deploy small-cell base stations to achieve data rates on the order of hundreds of Gigabits per second per user. The move to sub-THz frequencies will require attention to sustainability and reduction of power whenever possible to reduce the carbon footprint while maintaining adequate battery life for the massive number of resource-constrained devices to be deployed. This article analyzes power consumption of future wireless networks using a new metric, the power waste factor ($ W $), which shows promise for the study and development of \"green G\" - green technology for future wireless networks. Using $ W $, power efficiency can be considered by quantifying the power wasted by all devices on a signal path in a cascade. We then show that the consumption efficiency factor ($CEF$), defined as the ratio of the maximum data rate achieved to the total power consumed, is a novel and powerful measure of power efficiency that shows less energy per bit is expended as the cell size shrinks and carrier frequency and channel bandwidth increase. Our findings offer a standard approach to calculating and comparing power consumption and energy efficiency. "
