  "title": "Alive publication",
  "abstract": "  An alive publication is a new genre for presenting the results of scientific research, which means that scientific work is published online and then constantly developing and improving by its author. Serious errors and typos are no longer fatal, nor do they haunt the author for the rest of his or her life. The reader of an alive publication knows that the author is constantly monitoring changes occurring in this branch of science. Alive publication faces the inertia of scientific publishing traditions and, in particular, traditional bibliometrics. Unfortunately, at present, the author who supports an alive publication is dramatically losing out on many generally accepted bibliometric indicators. The alive publication encourages the development of the bibliography apparatus. Each bibliographic reference will soon have to contain such important for the reader updating on-the-fly attributes as attendance, number of external links, date of the last revision, etc. It is to be expected that as the alive publication spreads over to the scientific world, the author's concern for the publication's evolution will become like a parent's care for the development of a child. The Internet will be filled with scientific publications that do not lose their relevance over time. "
