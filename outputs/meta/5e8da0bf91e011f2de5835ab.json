  "abstract": "  With Full Duplex (FD), wireless terminal is capable of transmitting and receiving data simultaneously in the same frequency resources, however, it introduces self interference and co-channel interference. Even though various signal processing techniques are emerged to cancel the self interference, the bottleneck for FD performance in cellular systems is the co-channel interference from the other uplink and downlink signals. In this work we have studied both the uplink and downlink performances of a FD cellular network, where users employ fractional power control in uplink. We use Matern Cluster Process to model the network, which provides a tractable and realistic model to characterize the user-base station distances which are needed for uplink power control. Based on the obtained coverage probabilities, rates and their robust approximations, we show that while FD improves downlink performance, it severely hurts the uplink performance. Also, we provide a trade-off between uplink and downlink performances. Our study suggests dense deployment of low power base stations can improve the performance of FD system. "
