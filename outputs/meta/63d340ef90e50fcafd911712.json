  "title": "Cluster Forming of Multiagent Systems in Rolling Horizon Games with\n  Non-uniform Horizons",
  "abstract": "  Consensus and cluster forming of multiagent systems in the face of jamming attacks along with reactive recovery actions by a defender are discussed. The attacker is capable to disable some of the edges of the network with the objective to divide the agents into a smaller size of clusters while, in response, the defender recovers some of the edges by increasing the transmission power. We consider repeated games where the resulting optimal strategies for the two players are derived in a rolling horizon fashion. The attacker and the defender possess different computational abilities to calculate their strategies. This aspect is represented by the non-uniform values of the horizon lengths and the game periods. Theoretical and simulation based results demonstrate the effects of the horizon lengths and the game periods on the agents' states. "
