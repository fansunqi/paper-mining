  "abstract": "  We present efficient computational solutions to the problems of checking equality, performing multiplication, and computing minimal representatives of elements of free bands. A band is any semigroup satisfying the identity $x ^ 2 \\approx x$ and the free band $\\operatorname{FB}(k)$ is the free object in the variety of $k$-generated bands. Radoszewski and Rytter developed a linear time algorithm for checking whether two words represent the same element of a free band. In this paper we describe an alternate linear time algorithm for checking the same problem. The algorithm we present utilises a representation of words as synchronous deterministic transducers that lend themselves to efficient (quadratic in the size of the alphabet) multiplication in the free band. This representation also provides a means of finding the short-lex least word representing a given free band element with quadratic complexity. "
