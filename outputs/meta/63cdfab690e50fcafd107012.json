  "title": "Adjoint-Based Identification of Sound Sources for Sound Reinforcement\n  and Source Localization",
  "abstract": "  The identification of sound sources is a common problem in acoustics. Different parameters are sought, among these are signal and position of the sources. We present an adjoint-based approach for sound source identification, which employs computational aeroacoustic techniques. Two different applications are presented as a proof-of-concept: optimization of a sound reinforcement setup and the localization of (moving) sound sources. "
