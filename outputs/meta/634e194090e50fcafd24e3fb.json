  "title": "A Kernel Approach for PDE Discovery and Operator Learning",
  "abstract": "  This article presents a three-step framework for learning and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using kernel methods. Given a training set consisting of pairs of noisy PDE solutions and source/boundary terms on a mesh, kernel smoothing is utilized to denoise the data and approximate derivatives of the solution. This information is then used in a kernel regression model to learn the algebraic form of the PDE. The learned PDE is then used within a kernel based solver to approximate the solution of the PDE with a new source/boundary term, thereby constituting an operator learning framework. Numerical experiments compare the method to state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate its competitive performance. "
