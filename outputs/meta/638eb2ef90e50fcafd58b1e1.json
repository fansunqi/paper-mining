  "abstract": "  The vast data deluge at the network's edge is raising multiple challenges for the edge computing community. One of them is identifying edge storage servers where data from edge devices/sensors have to be stored to ensure low latency access services to emerging edge applications. Existing data placement algorithms mainly focus on locality, latency, and zoning to select edge storage servers under multiple environmental constraints. This paper uses a data placement framework to compare distance-based, latency-based, and spatial-awareness-based data placement strategies, which all share a decision-making system with similar constraints. Based on simulation experiments, we observed that the spatial-awareness-based strategy could provide a quality of service on par with the latency-based and better than the distance-based strategy. "
