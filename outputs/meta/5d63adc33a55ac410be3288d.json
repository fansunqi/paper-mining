  "abstract": "  Denote by $\\Delta_M$ the $M$-dimensional simplex. A map $f\\colon \\Delta_M\\to\\mathbb R^d$ is an almost $r$-embedding if $f\\sigma_1\\cap\\ldots\\cap f\\sigma_r=\\emptyset$ whenever $\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_r$ are pairwise disjoint faces. A counterexample to the topological Tverberg conjecture asserts that if $r$ is not a prime power and $d\\ge2r+1$, then there is an almost $r$-embedding $\\Delta_{(d+1)(r-1)}\\to\\mathbb R^d$. This was improved by Blagojevi\\'c-Frick-Ziegler using a simple construction of higher-dimensional counterexamples by taking $k$-fold join power of lower-dimensional ones. We improve this further (for $d$ large compared to $r$):   If $r$ is not a prime power and $N:=(d+1)r-r\\Big\\lceil\\dfrac{d+2}{r+1}\\Big\\rceil-2$, then there is an almost $r$-embedding $\\Delta_N\\to\\mathbb R^d$.   For the $r$-fold van Kampen-Flores conjecture we also produce counterexamples which are stronger than previously known. Our proof is based on generalizations of the Mabillard-Wagner theorem on construction of almost $r$-embeddings from equivariant maps, and of the \\\"Ozaydin theorem on existence of equivariant maps.
