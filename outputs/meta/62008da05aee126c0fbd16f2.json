  "abstract": "  Full-field traffic state information (i.e., flow, speed, and density) is critical for the successful operation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) on freeways. However, incomplete traffic information tends to be directly collected from traffic detectors that are insufficiently installed in most areas, which is a major obstacle to the popularization of ITS. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces an innovative traffic state estimation (TSE) framework that hybrid regression machine learning techniques (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)) with a traffic physics model (e.g., second-order macroscopic traffic flow model) using limited information from traffic sensors as inputs to construct accurate and full-field estimated traffic state for freeway systems. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed TSE framework, this paper conducted empirical studies on a real-world data set collected from a stretch of I-15 freeway in Salt Lake City, Utah. Experimental results show that the proposed method has been proved to estimate full-field traffic information accurately. Hence, the proposed method could provide accurate and full-field traffic information, thus providing the basis for the popularization of ITS. "
