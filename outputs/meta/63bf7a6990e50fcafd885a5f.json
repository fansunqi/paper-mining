  "abstract": "We present Orbit, a unified and modular framework for robot learning powered\nby NVIDIA Isaac Sim. It offers a modular design to easily and efficiently\ncreate robotic environments with photo-realistic scenes and high-fidelity rigid\nand deformable body simulation. With Orbit, we provide a suite of benchmark\ntasks of varying difficulty \u2013 from single-stage cabinet opening and cloth\nfolding to multi-stage tasks such as room reorganization. To support working\nwith diverse observations and action spaces, we include fixed-arm and mobile\nmanipulators with different physically-based sensors and motion generators.\nOrbit allows training reinforcement learning policies and collecting large\ndemonstration datasets from hand-crafted or expert solutions in a matter of\nminutes by leveraging GPU-based parallelization. In summary, we offer an\nopen-sourced framework that readily comes with 16 robotic platforms, 4 sensor\nmodalities, 10 motion generators, more than 20 benchmark tasks, and wrappers to\n4 learning libraries. With this framework, we aim to support various research\nareas, including representation learning, reinforcement learning, imitation\nlearning, and task and motion planning. We hope it helps establish\ninterdisciplinary collaborations in these communities, and its modularity makes\nit easily extensible for more tasks and applications in the future."
