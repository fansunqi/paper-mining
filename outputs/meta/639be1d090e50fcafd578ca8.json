  "title": "A Comprehensive Study on Off-path SmartNIC",
  "abstract": "  SmartNIC has recently emerged as an attractive device to accelerate distributed systems. However, there has been no comprehensive characterization of SmartNIC especially on the network part. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of off-path SmartNIC. Our experimental study uncovers the key performance characteristics of the communication among the client, SmartNIC SoC, and the host. We find without considering SmartNIC hardware architecture, communications with it can cause up to 48% bandwidth degradation due to performance anomalies. We also propose implications to address the anomalies. "
