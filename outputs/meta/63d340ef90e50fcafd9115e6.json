  "title": "Design of Mobile Manipulator for Fire Extinguisher Testing. Part II:\n  Design and Simulation",
  "abstract": "  All flames are extinguished as early as possible, or fire services have to deal with major conflagrations. This leads to the fact that the quality of fire extinguishers has become a very sensitive and important issue in firefighting. Inspired by the development of automatic fire fighting systems, this paper presents a mobile manipulator to evaluate the power of fire extinguishers, which is designed according to the standard of fire extinguishers named as ISO 7165:2009 and ISO 11601:2008. A detailed discussion on key specifications solutions and mechanical design of the chassis of the mobile manipulator has been presented in Part I: Key Specifications and Conceptual Design. The focus of this part is on the rest of the mechanical design and controller de-sign of the mobile manipulator. "
