  "title": "Security Challenges when Space Merges with Cyberspace",
  "abstract": "  Spaceborne systems, such as communication satellites, sensory, surveillance, GPS and a multitude of other functionalities, form an integral part of global ICT cyberinfrastructures. However, a focussed discourse highlighting the distinctive threats landscape of these spaceborne assets is conspicuous by its absence. This position paper specifically considers the interplay of Space and Cyberspace to highlight security challenges that warrant dedicated attention in securing these complex infrastructures. The opinion piece additionally adds summary opinions on (a) emerging technology trends and (b) advocacy on technological and policy issues needed to support security responsiveness and mitigation. "
