  "abstract": "  Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication modality that utilizes chemical signals in the form of molecules to exchange information between spatially separated entities. Pulse shaping is an important process in all communication systems, as it modifies the waveform of transmitted signals to match the characteristics of the communication channel for reliable and high-speed information transfer. In MC systems, the unconventional architectures of components, such as transmitters and receivers, and the complex, nonlinear, and time-varying nature of MC channels make pulse shaping even more important. While several pulse shaping methods have been theoretically proposed for MC, their practicality and performance are still uncertain. Moreover, the majority of recently proposed experimental MC testbeds that rely on microfluidics technology lack the incorporation of programmable pulse shaping methods, which hinders the accurate evaluation of MC techniques in practical settings. To address the challenges associated with pulse shaping in microfluidic MC systems, we provide a comprehensive overview of practical microfluidic chemical waveform generation techniques that have been experimentally validated and whose architectures can inform the design of pulse shaping methods for microfluidic MC systems and testbeds. These techniques include those based on hydrodynamic and acoustofluidic force fields, as well as electrochemical reactions. We also discuss the fundamental working mechanisms and system architectures of these techniques, and compare their performances in terms of spatiotemporal resolution, selectivity, system complexity, and other performance metrics relevant to MC applications, as well as their feasibility for practical MC applications.
