  "title": "A Constrained-Optimization Approach to the Execution of Prioritized\n  Stacks of Learned Multi-Robot Tasks",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents a constrained-optimization formulation for the prioritized execution of learned robot tasks. The framework lends itself to the execution of tasks encoded by value functions, such as tasks learned using the reinforcement learning paradigm. The tasks are encoded as constraints of a convex optimization program by using control Lyapunov functions. Moreover, an additional constraint is enforced in order to specify relative priorities between the tasks. The proposed approach is showcased in simulation using a team of mobile robots executing coordinated multi-robot tasks. "
