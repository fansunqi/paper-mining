  "title": "On the Adversarial Robustness of Camera-based 3D Object Detection",
  "abstract": "  In recent years, camera-based 3D object detection has gained widespread attention for its ability to achieve high performance with low computational cost. However, the robustness of these methods to adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the robustness of leading camera-based 3D object detection methods under various adversarial conditions. Our experiments reveal five interesting findings: (a) the use of accurate depth estimation effectively improves robustness; (b) depth-estimation-free approaches do not show superior robustness; (c) bird's-eye-view-based representations exhibit greater robustness against localization attacks; (d) incorporating multi-frame benign inputs can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks; and (e) addressing long-tail problems can enhance robustness. We hope our work can provide guidance for the design of future camera-based object detection modules with improved adversarial robustness. "
