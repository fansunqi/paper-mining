  "title": "Making first order linear logic a generating grammar",
  "abstract": "  It is known that different categorial grammars have surface representation in a fragment of first order multiplicative linear logic. We show that the fragment of interest is equivalent to the recently introduced {\\it extended tensor type calculus}. This provides the former not only with some alternative syntax and intuitive geometric representation, but also with an intrinsic deductive system, which has been absent. "
