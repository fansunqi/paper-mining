  "abstract": "  This article presents a multi-robot trajectory planning method which not only guarantees optimization feasibility and but also resolves deadlocks in obstacle-dense environments. The method is proposed via formulating a recursive optimization problem, where a novel safe corridor is generated online to ensure obstacle avoidance in trajectory planning. A dynamic-priority mechanism is combined with the right-hand rule to handle potential deadlocks that are much harder to resolve due to static obstacles. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art results are conducted to validate the improved safety and success rate. Additional hardware experiments are carried out with up to eight nano-quadrotors in various cluttered scenarios. "
