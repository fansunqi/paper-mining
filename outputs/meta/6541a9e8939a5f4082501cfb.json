  "abstract": "  Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers. "
