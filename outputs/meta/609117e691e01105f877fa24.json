  "abstract": "  Under the aegis of computer vision and deep learning technology, a new emerging techniques has introduced that anyone can make highly realistic but fake videos, images even can manipulates the voices. This technology is widely known as Deepfake Technology. Although it seems interesting techniques to make fake videos or image of something or some individuals but it could spread as misinformation via internet. Deepfake contents could be dangerous for individuals as well as for our communities, organizations, countries religions etc. As Deepfake content creation involve a high level expertise with combination of several algorithms of deep learning, it seems almost real and genuine and difficult to differentiate. In this paper, a wide range of articles have been examined to understand Deepfake technology more extensively. We have examined several articles to find some insights such as what is Deepfake, who are responsible for this, is there any benefits of Deepfake and what are the challenges of this technology. We have also examined several creation and detection techniques. Our study revealed that although Deepfake is a threat to our societies, proper measures and strict regulations could prevent this. "
