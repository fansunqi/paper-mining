  "abstract": "  We shed light on a pitfall and an opportunity in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We prove that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) only with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or ReLU-like Lipschitz activation functions will always lead to a vanished Hessian. Such a network-imposed constraint contradicts any second- or higher-order partial differential equations (PDEs). Therefore, a ReLU-based MLP cannot form a permissible function space for the approximation of their solutions. Inspired by this pitfall, we prove that a linear PDE up to the $n$-th order can be strictly satisfied by an MLP with $C^n$ activation functions when the weights of its output layer lie on a certain hyperplane, as called the out-layer-hyperplane. An MLP equipped with the out-layer-hyperplane becomes \"physics-enforced\", no longer requiring a loss function for the PDE itself (but only those for the initial and boundary conditions). Such a hyperplane exists not only for MLPs but for any network architecture tailed by a fully-connected hidden layer. To our knowledge, this should be the first PINN architecture that enforces point-wise correctness of PDEs. We show a closed-form expression of the out-layer-hyperplane for second-order linear PDEs, which can be generalised to higher-order nonlinear PDEs. "
