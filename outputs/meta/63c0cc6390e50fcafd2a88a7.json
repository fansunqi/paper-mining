  "title": "Photonic Spatial-Euler Ising Machine for Solving 20000-node Max-cut\n  Problem",
  "abstract": "  To tackle challenging combinatorial optimization problems, analog computing machines based on the nature-inspired Ising model are attracting increasing attentions in order to disruptively overcome the impending limitations on conventional electronic computers. Photonic spatial Ising machine has become an unique and primitive solution with all-to-all connections to solve large-scale Max-cut problems. However, spin configuration and flipping requires two independent sets of spatial light modulators (SLMs) for amplitude and phase modulation, which will lead to tremendous engineering difficulty of optical alignment and coupling. We report a novel quadrature photonic spatial-Euler Ising machine to realize large-scale and flexible spin-interaction configuration and spin-flip in a single spatial light modulator, and develop a noise enhancement approach by adding digital white noise onto detected optical signals. We experimentally show that such proposal accelerates solving (un)weighted, (non)fully connected, 20736-node Max-cut problems, which offers obvious advantages over simulation and heuristic algorithm results in digital computers.
