  "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus on addressing the open-set face identification problem on a few-shot gallery by fine-tuning. The problem assumes a realistic scenario for face identification, where only a small number of face images is given for enrollment and any unknown identity must be rejected during identification. We observe that face recognition models pretrained on a large dataset and naively fine-tuned models perform poorly for this task. Motivated by this issue, we propose an effective fine-tuning scheme with classifier weight imprinting and exclusive BatchNorm layer tuning. For further improvement of rejection accuracy on unknown identities, we propose a novel matcher called Neighborhood Aware Cosine (NAC) that computes similarity based on neighborhood information. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes thoroughly on large-scale face benchmarks across different convolutional neural network architectures.
