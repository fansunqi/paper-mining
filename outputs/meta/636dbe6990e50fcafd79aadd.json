  "abstract": "  We show that for a plane imaged by an endoscope the specular isophotes are concentric circles on the scene plane, which appear as nested ellipses in the image. We show that these ellipses can be detected and used to estimate the plane's normal direction, forming a normal reconstruction method, which we validate on simulated data. In practice, the anatomical surfaces visible in endoscopic images are locally planar. We use our method to show that the surface normal can thus be reconstructed for each of the numerous specularities typically visible on moist tissues. We show results on laparoscopic and colonoscopic images. "
