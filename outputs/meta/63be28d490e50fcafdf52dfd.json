  "abstract": "  In the future, quantum computers will become widespread and a network of quantum repeaters will provide them with end-to-end entanglement of remote quantum bits. As a result, a pervasive quantum computation infrastructure will emerge, which will unlock several novel applications, including distributed quantum computing, that is the pooling of resources on multiple computation nodes to address problem instances that are unattainable by any individual quantum computer. In this paper, we first investigate the issue of service differentiation in this new environment. Then, we define the problem of how to select which computation nodes should participate in each pool, so as to achieve a fair share of the quantum network resources available. The analysis is performed via an open source simulator and the results are fully and readily available. "
