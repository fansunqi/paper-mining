  "abstract": "  This paper presents a method for the normal estimation of mirrors and transparent objects that are difficult to recognize with a camera. To create a diffuse reflective surface, we propose spraying water vapor onto transparent or mirror surfaces. In the proposed method, we move an ultrasonic humidifier equipped on the tip of a robotic arm to apply sprayed water vapor onto the plane of a target object to form a cross-shaped misted area. Diffuse reflective surfaces are partially generated as misted areas, which allows the camera to detect the surface of the target object. The viewpoint of the gripper-mounted camera is adjusted such that the extracted misted area appears to be the largest in the image, and finally, the plane normal of the target object surface is estimated. Normal estimation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The RMSEs of the azimuth estimation for the mirror and transparent glass were approximately 4.2 and 5.8 degrees, respectively. Consequently, our robot experiments demonstrate that our robotic wiper can perform contact-force-regulated wiping motions to clean a transparent window, as humans do. "
