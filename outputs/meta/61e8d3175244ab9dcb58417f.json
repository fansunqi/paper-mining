  "title": "Interpretable Learned Emergent Communication for Human-Agent Teams",
  "abstract": "  Learning interpretable communication is essential for multi-agent and human-agent teams (HATs). In multi-agent reinforcement learning for partially-observable environments, agents may convey information to others via learned communication, allowing the team to complete its task. Inspired by human languages, recent works study discrete (using only a finite set of tokens) and sparse (communicating only at some time-steps) communication. However, the utility of such communication in human-agent team experiments has not yet been investigated. In this work, we analyze the efficacy of sparse-discrete methods for producing emergent communication that enables high agent-only and human-agent team performance. We develop agent-only teams that communicate sparsely via our scheme of Enforcers that sufficiently constrain communication to any budget. Our results show no loss or minimal loss of performance in benchmark environments and tasks. In human-agent teams tested in benchmark environments, where agents have been modeled using the Enforcers, we find that a prototype-based method produces meaningful discrete tokens that enable human partners to learn agent communication faster and better than a one-hot baseline. Additional HAT experiments show that an appropriate sparsity level lowers the cognitive load of humans when communicating with teams of agents and leads to superior team performance. "
