  "title": "Thought Flow Nets: From Single Predictions to Trains of Model Thought",
  "abstract": "  When humans solve complex problems, they typically create a sequence of ideas (involving an intuitive decision, reflection, error correction, etc.) in order to reach a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. Taking inspiration from Hegel's dialectics, we propose the concept of a thought flow which creates a sequence of predictions. We present a self-correction mechanism that is trained to estimate the model's correctness and performs iterative prediction updates based on the correctness prediction's gradient. We introduce our method at the example of question answering and conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate (i) our method's ability to correct its own predictions and (ii) its potential to notably improve model performances. In addition, we conduct a qualitative analysis of thought flow correction patterns and explore how thought flow predictions affect human users within a crowdsourcing study. We find that (iii) thought flows enable improved user performance and are perceived as more natural, correct, and intelligent as single and/or top-3 predictions. "
