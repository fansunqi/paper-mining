  "title": "A New Noncoherent Gaussian Signaling Scheme for Low Probability of\n  Detection Communications",
  "abstract": "  We propose a novel, Gaussian signaling mechanism for low probability of detection (LPD) communication systems with either single or multiple antennas. The new scheme is designed to allow the noncoherent detection of Gaussian-distributed signals, enabling LPD communications using signals that follow the complex Gaussian distribution in the time and frequency domains. It is demonstrated via simulations that the proposed scheme achieves better performance than a comparable conventional scheme over the entire SNR region, with the advantage becoming more significant in scenarios with lower overhead.
