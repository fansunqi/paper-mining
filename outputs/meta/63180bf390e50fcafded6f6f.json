  "abstract": "  In this paper, we determine the computational complexity of recognizing two graph classes, \\emph{grounded L}-graphs and \\emph{stabbable grid intersection} graphs. An L-shape is made by joining the bottom end-point of a vertical ($\\vert$) segment to the left end-point of a horizontal ($-$) segment. The top end-point of the vertical segment is known as the {\\em anchor} of the L-shape. Grounded L-graphs are the intersection graphs of L-shapes such that all the L-shapes' anchors lie on the same horizontal line. We show that recognizing grounded L-graphs is NP-complete. This answers an open question asked by Jel{\\'\\i}nek \\& T{\\\"o}pfer (Electron. J. Comb., 2019).   Grid intersection graphs are the intersection graphs of axis-parallel line segments in which two vertical (similarly, two horizontal) segments cannot intersect. We say that a (not necessarily axis-parallel) straight line $\\ell$ stabs a segment $s$, if $s$ intersects $\\ell$. A graph $G$ is a stabbable grid intersection graph ($StabGIG$) if there is a grid intersection representation of $G$ in which the same line stabs all its segments. We show that recognizing $StabGIG$ graphs is $NP$-complete, even on a restricted class of graphs. This answers an open question asked by Chaplick \\etal (\\textsc{O}rder, 2018). "
