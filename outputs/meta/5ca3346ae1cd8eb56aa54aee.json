  "title": "The Schulze Method of Voting",
  "abstract": "  We propose a new single-winner election method (\"Schulze method\") and prove that it satisfies many academic criteria (e.g. monotonicity, reversal symmetry, resolvability, independence of clones, Condorcet criterion, k-consistency, polynomial runtime). We then generalize this method to proportional representation by the single transferable vote (\"Schulze STV\") and to methods to calculate a proportional ranking (\"Schulze proportional ranking\"). Furthermore, we propose a generalization of the Condorcet criterion to multi-winner elections. This paper contains a large number of examples to illustrate the proposed methods. "
