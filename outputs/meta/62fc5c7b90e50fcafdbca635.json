  "title": "FALCON: Faithful Neural Semantic Entailment over ALC Ontologies",
  "abstract": "  Neural networks using distributed representations can benefit from computing semantic entailments because they enable finding contradictions, implied knowledge, or computing plans on how to achieve distant goals. We developed FALCON, a Fuzzy ALC Ontology Neural reasoner. FALCON uses fuzzy logic operators to generate model structures for arbitrary ALC ontologies, and uses multiple model structures to compute semantic entailments. Theoretical results show that FALCON approximates semantic entailment over ALC ontologies and therefore endows neural networks with world models and the ability to reason over them. Experimental results show that FALCON enables approximate reasoning, paraconsistent reasoning (reasoning with inconsistencies), and improves machine learning in the biomedical domain by incorporating background knowledge.
