  "title": "Keywords for Bias",
  "abstract": "  This work proposes to analyse some keywords for bias analysis. For this, we are using several NLP approaches and compare them based on their capability of detecting keywords to analyse bias. The overall findings show that our proposed approach gives comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches on different benchmark datasets. "
