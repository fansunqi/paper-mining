  "title": "Roadmap for Unconventional Computing with Nanotechnology",
  "abstract": "In the \"Beyond Moore's Law\" era, with increasing edge intelligence,\ndomain-specific computing embracing unconventional approaches will become\nincreasingly prevalent. At the same time, adopting a variety of\nnanotechnologies will offer benefits in energy cost, computational speed,\nreduced footprint, cyber resilience, and processing power. The time is ripe for\na roadmap for unconventional computing with nanotechnologies to guide future\nresearch, and this collection aims to fill that need. The authors provide a\ncomprehensive roadmap for neuromorphic computing using electron spins,\nmemristive devices, two-dimensional nanomaterials, nanomagnets, and various\ndynamical systems. They also address other paradigms such as Ising machines,\nBayesian inference engines, probabilistic computing with p-bits, processing in\nmemory, quantum memories and algorithms, computing with skyrmions and spin\nwaves, and brain-inspired computing for incremental learning and\nproblem-solving in severely resource-constrained environments. These approaches\nhave advantages over traditional Boolean computing based on von Neumann\narchitecture. As the computational requirements for artificial intelligence\ngrow 50 times faster than Moore's Law for electronics, more unconventional\napproaches to computing and signal processing will appear on the horizon, and\nthis roadmap will help identify future needs and challenges. In a very fertile\nfield, experts in the field aim to present some of the dominant and most\npromising technologies for unconventional computing that will be around for\nsome time to come. Within a holistic approach, the goal is to provide pathways\nfor solidifying the field and guiding future impactful discoveries."
