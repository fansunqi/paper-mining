  "abstract": "  About 15% of the world population is affected by a disability in some form, amongst whom only 31% perform the recommended exercises without intervention. We are working on developing a motivating and effective way to encourage people. In our work, we leverage the fact that repetitive exercises can help people with motor disabilities due to the robust plasticity of the pre-frontal cognitive control system in the brain. We investigate the role of repetitive activities for neurorehabilitation with the help of a brain computer interface, formulated using immersive game design with Kinect v2.0 and Unity 3D. We also introduce a game design paradigm for adaptive learning for the patients. "
