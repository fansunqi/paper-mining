  "title": "Encoder-Decoder Network with Guided Transmission Map: Architecture",
  "abstract": "  An insight into the architecture of the Encoder-Decoder Network with Guided Transmission Map (EDN-GTM), a novel and effective single image dehazing scheme, is presented in this paper. The EDN-GTM takes a conventional RGB hazy image in conjunction with the corresponding transmission map estimated by the dark channel prior (DCP) approach as inputs of the network. The EDN-GTM adopts an enhanced structure of U-Net developed for dehazing tasks and the resulting EDN-GDM has shown state-of-the-art performances on benchmark dehazing datasets in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. In order to give an in-depth understanding of the well-designed architecture which largely contributes to the success of the EDN-GTM, extensive experiments and analysis from selecting the core structure of the scheme to investigating advanced network designs are presented in this paper.
