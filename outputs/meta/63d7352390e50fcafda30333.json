  "abstract": "  XL-MIMO promises to provide ultrahigh data rates in Terahertz (THz) spectrum. However, the spherical-wavefront wireless transmission caused by large aperture array presents huge challenges for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. Two independent parameters (physical angles and transmission distance) should be simultaneously considered in XL-MIMO beamforming, which brings severe overhead consumption and beamforming degradation. To address this problem, we exploit the near-field channel characteristic and propose one low-overhead hierarchical beam training scheme for near-field XL-MIMO system. Firstly, we project near-field channel into spatial-angular domain and slope-intercept domain to capture detailed representations. Secondly, a novel spatial-chirp beam-aided codebook and corresponding hierarchical update policy are proposed. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the superior performances on beamforming and training overhead. "
