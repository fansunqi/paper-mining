  "title": "Structured Decompositions: Structural and Algorithmic Compositionality",
  "abstract": "  We introduce structured decompositions: category-theoretic generalizations of many combinatorial invariants -- including tree-width, layered tree-width, co-tree-width and graph decomposition width -- which have played a central role in the study of structural and algorithmic compositionality in both graph theory and parameterized complexity. Structured decompositions allow us to generalize combinatorial invariants to new settings (for example decompositions of matroids) in which they describe algorithmically useful structural compositionality. As an application of our theory we prove an algorithmic meta theorem for the Sub_P-composition problem which, when instantiated in the category of graphs, yields compositional algorithms for NP-hard problems such as: Maximum Bipartite Subgraph, Maximum Planar Subgraph and Longest Path.
