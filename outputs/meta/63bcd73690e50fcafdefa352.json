  "title": "The Algebra of Nondeterministic Finite Automata",
  "abstract": "  A process algebra is proposed, whose semantics maps a term to a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA, for short). We prove a representability theorem: for each NFA $N$, there exists a process algebraic term $p$ such that its semantics is an NFA isomorphic to $N$. Moreover, we provide a concise axiomatization of language equivalence: two NFAs $N_1$ and $N_2$ recognize the same language if and only if the associated terms $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively, can be equated by means of a set of axioms, comprising 7 axioms plus 3 conditional axioms, only.
