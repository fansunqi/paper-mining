  "abstract": "Millimeter-wave networks have already been successfully rolled out in many\ncountries and now the research direction heads toward new technologies and\nstandards to enable Tbps rates for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless\ncommunication systems. This work studies a point-to-point terahertz (THz)\ncommunication network exploiting the concept of a fluid antenna system (FAS)\nover correlated alpha-mu fading channels, nicely fitting the THz communication.\nFurthermore, the considered system is expanded to the selection-combining-FAS\n(SC-FAS) and maximum-gain-combining- FAS (MGC-FAS) diversity variates at the\nreceiver side. The proposed FAS and its diversity configuration techniques are\naimed to combat the high path loss, blockages, and molecular absorption effect\nrelated to the THz band. Our contribution includes comprehensive outage\nprobability (OP) performance analysis for the THz band given the non-diversity\nand diversity FAS receivers. Moreover, the derived outage probability formulas\nare verified via Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results have confirmed the\nsuperior performance of the MGC-FAS scheme in terms of OP. Finally, this work\njustifies that a higher number of antenna ports dramatically improves the\nsystem performance, even in the presence of correlation."
