  "title": "Predicting China's CPI by Scanner Big Data",
  "abstract": "  Scanner big data has potential to construct Consumer Price Index (CPI). This work utilizes the scanner data of supermarket retail sales, which are provided by China Ant Business Alliance (CAA), to construct the Scanner-data Food Consumer Price Index (S-FCPI) in China, and the index reliability is verified by other macro indicators, especially by China's CPI. And not only that, we build multiple machine learning models based on S-FCPI to quantitatively predict the CPI growth rate in months, and qualitatively predict those directions and levels. The prediction models achieve much better performance than the traditional time series models in existing research. This work paves the way to construct and predict price indexes through using scanner big data in China. S-FCPI can not only reflect the changes of goods prices in higher frequency and wider geographic dimension than CPI, but also provide a new perspective for monitoring macroeconomic operation, predicting inflation and understanding other economic issues, which is beneficial supplement to China's CPI.
