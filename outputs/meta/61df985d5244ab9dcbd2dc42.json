  "title": "A Unified Framework for Calculating First Arrival Position Density in\n  Molecular Communication",
  "abstract": "  This paper introduces a novel unified framework for calculating the first arrival position (FAP) density in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with fully-absorbing receivers, applicable to any spatial dimension or receiver shape. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method by presenting two concrete examples from the MC literature: the 2D line receiver and 3D spherical receiver. Our approach successfully reproduces existing results on FAP density and further enhances the original formula for the 2D line receiver by accommodating arbitrary drift directions. The proposed framework offers a comprehensive and versatile solution for determining FAP density in diffusive MC channels with fully-absorbing receivers, paving the way for more robust and efficient system designs.
