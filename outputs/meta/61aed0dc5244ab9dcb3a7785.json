  "title": "On Complexity of 1-Center in Various Metrics",
  "abstract": "  We consider the classic 1-center problem: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a metric space find the point in $P$ that minimizes the maximum distance to the other points of $P$. We study the complexity of this problem in $d$-dimensional $\\ell_p$-metrics and in edit and Ulam metrics over strings of length $d$. Our results for the 1-center problem may be classified based on $d$ as follows.   $\\bullet$ Small $d$: Assuming the hitting set conjecture (HSC), we show that when $d=\\omega(\\log n)$, no subquadratic algorithm can solve 1-center problem in any of the $\\ell_p$-metrics, or in edit or Ulam metrics.   $\\bullet$ Large $d$: When $d=\\Omega(n)$, we extend our conditional lower bound to rule out subquartic algorithms for 1-center problem in edit metric (assuming Quantified SETH). On the other hand, we give a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for 1-center in Ulam metric with running time $\\tilde{O_{\\varepsilon}}(nd+n^2\\sqrt{d})$.   We also strengthen some of the above lower bounds by allowing approximations or by reducing the dimension $d$, but only against a weaker class of algorithms which list all requisite solutions. Moreover, we extend one of our hardness results to rule out subquartic algorithms for the well-studied 1-median problem in the edit metric, where given a set of $n$ strings each of length $n$, the goal is to find a string in the set that minimizes the sum of the edit distances to the rest of the strings in the set.
