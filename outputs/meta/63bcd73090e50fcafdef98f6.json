  "abstract": "  $\\bf{Purpose}$: To describe the 3D structural changes in both connective and neural tissues of the optic nerve head (ONH) that occur concurrently at different stages of glaucoma using traditional and AI-driven approaches.   $\\bf{Methods}$: We included 213 normal, 204 mild glaucoma (mean deviation [MD] $\\ge$ -6.00 dB), 118 moderate glaucoma (MD of -6.01 to -12.00 dB), and 118 advanced glaucoma patients (MD < -12.00 dB). All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D with Spectralis optical coherence tomography. To describe the 3D structural phenotype of glaucoma as a function of severity, we used two different approaches: (1) We extracted human-defined 3D structural parameters of the ONH including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, lamina cribrosa (LC) shape and depth at different stages of glaucoma; (2) we also employed a geometric deep learning method (i.e. PointNet) to identify the most important 3D structural features that differentiate ONHs from different glaucoma severity groups without any human input.   $\\bf{Results}$: We observed that the majority of ONH structural changes occurred in the early glaucoma stage, followed by a plateau effect in the later stages. Using PointNet, we also found that 3D ONH structural changes were present in both neural and connective tissues. In both approaches, we observed that structural changes were more prominent in the superior and inferior quadrant of the ONH, particularly in the RNFL, the prelamina, and the LC. As the severity of glaucoma increased, these changes became more diffuse (i.e. widespread), particularly in the LC.   $\\bf{Conclusions}$: In this study, we were able to uncover complex 3D structural changes of the ONH in both neural and connective tissues as a function of glaucoma severity. We hope to provide new insights into the complex pathophysiology of glaucoma that might help clinicians in their daily clinical care. "
