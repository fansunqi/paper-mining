  "title": "Resolution of the Linear-Bounded Automata Question",
  "abstract": "  This work resolves a longstanding open question in automata theory, i.e., the {\\em linear-bounded automata question} ({\\em LBA question}), which can also be phrased succinctly in the language of computational complexity theory as $DSPACE[n]\\overset{?}{=} NSPACE[n]$. We show first that $DSPACE[n]\\neq NSPACE[n]$. Then, we show by padding argument that $DSPACE[\\log n]\\neq NSPACE[\\log n]$. Our proof technique is primarily based on diagonalization by a universal nondeterministic $n$ space-bounded Turing machine against all deterministic $n$ space-bounded Turing machines. Our proof also implies the following fundamental consequences:   (1) There is no deterministic Turing machine of space complexity $\\log n$ deciding the $st$-connectivity question (STCON);   (2) $L\\neq P$.
