  "title": "Solving the HP model with Nested Monte Carlo Search",
  "abstract": "  In this paper we present a new Monte Carlo Search (MCS) algorithm for finding the ground state energy of proteins in the HP-model. We also compare it briefly to other MCS algorithms not usually used on the HP-model and provide an overview of the algorithms used on HP-model. The algorithm presented in this paper does not beat state of the art algorithms, see PERM (Hsu and Grassberger 2011), REMC (Thachuk, Shmygelska, and Hoos 2007) or WLRE (W\\\"ust and Landau 2012) for better results.
