  "title": "DriCon: On-device Just-in-Time Context Characterization for Unexpected\n  Driving Events",
  "abstract": "  Driving is a complex task carried out under the influence of diverse spatial objects and their temporal interactions. Therefore, a sudden fluctuation in driving behavior can be due to either a lack of driving skill or the effect of various on-road spatial factors such as pedestrian movements, peer vehicles' actions, etc. Therefore, understanding the context behind a degraded driving behavior just-in-time is necessary to ensure on-road safety. In this paper, we develop a system called \\ourmethod{} that exploits the information acquired from a dashboard-mounted edge-device to understand the context in terms of micro-events from a diverse set of on-road spatial factors and in-vehicle driving maneuvers taken. \\ourmethod{} uses the live in-house testbed and the largest publicly available driving dataset to generate human interpretable explanations against the unexpected driving events. Also, it provides a better insight with an improved similarity of $80$\\% over $50$ hours of driving data than the existing driving behavior characterization techniques. "
