  "abstract": "  This paper proposes a physically consistent Gaussian Process (GP) enabling the identification of uncertain Lagrangian systems. The function space is tailored according to the energy components of the Lagrangian and the differential equation structure, analytically guaranteeing physical and mathematical properties such as energy conservation and quadratic form. The novel formulation of Cholesky decomposed matrix kernels allow the probabilistic preservation of positive definiteness. Only differential input-to-output measurements of the function map are required while Gaussian noise is permitted in torques, velocities, and accelerations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in numerical simulation. "
