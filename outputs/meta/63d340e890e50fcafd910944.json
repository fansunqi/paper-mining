  "abstract": "  Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have shown great potential in generating realistic image data. We show how those models can be used to generate realistic microscopy image data in 2D and 3D based on simulated sketches of cellular structures. Multiple data sets are used as an inspiration to simulate sketches of different cellular structures, allowing to generate fully-annotated image data sets without requiring human interactions. Those data sets are used to train segmentation approaches and demonstrate that annotation-free segmentation of cellular structures in fluorescence microscopy image data can be achieved, thereby leaping towards the ultimate goal of eliminating the necessity of human annotation efforts.
