  "title": "MIS: A Multi-Identifier Management and Resolution System Based on\n  Consortium Blockchain in Metaverse",
  "abstract": "  As digital resources become diverse in the metaverse, a DNS-like system is necessary for management and resolution. However, the legacy DNS for the TCP/IP architecture was designed with security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to centralized management issues. Although there are several DNS alternatives based on the blockchain, manage only a single type of identifiers or separate identity and other types of identifiers, making it impossible for sub-metaverses to coexist and interconnect. This paper proposes the first-ever consortium blockchain System that simultaneously manages Multiple types of Identifiers (MIS) in the metaverse. We opt for a consortium blockchain due to its efficiency, enhanced security and manageability properties. MIS is first portrayed as a four-tier architecture whereby on-chain data is lightweight and compressed to save on storage while accelerating reading and writing operations. The resource data of sub-metaverses exists heterogeneously in the storage tier to alleviate migration. Then we introduce the key functions of the multi-identifiers comprising the registration, resolution, and inter-translation. Finally, MIS is implemented on two testbeds and is accessible online as an open-source system. The first testbed consists of 4 physical servers located in the UK and Malaysia while the second is made up of 200 virtual machines (VMs) spread over 26 countries across all 5 continents on Google Cloud. Experiments indicate that MIS provides efficient reading and writing performance that meets the requirements of traditional legacy DNS. It also shows that the latency of MIS outperforms public blockchain-based workarounds. "
