  "abstract": "  Matroid intersection is one of the most powerful frameworks of matroid theory that generalizes various problems in combinatorial optimization. Edmonds' fundamental theorem provides a min-max characterization for the unweighted setting, while Frank's weight-splitting theorem provides one for the weighted case. Several efficient algorithms were developed for these problems, all relying on the usage of one of the conventional oracles for both matroids.   In the present paper, we consider the tractability of the matroid intersection problem under restricted oracles. In particular, we focus on the rank sum, common independence, and maximum rank oracles. We give a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for weighted matroid intersection under the rank sum oracle. In the common independence oracle model, we prove that the unweighted matroid intersection problem is tractable when one of the matroids is a partition matroid, and that even the weighted case is solvable when one of the matroids is an elementary split matroid. Finally, we show that the common independence and maximum rank oracles together are strong enough to realize the steps of our algorithm under the rank sum oracle. "
