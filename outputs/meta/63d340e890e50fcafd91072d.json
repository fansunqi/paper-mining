  "abstract": "  Sequences of numbers (either natural integers, or integers or rational) of level $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ have been defined in \\cite{Fra05,Fra-Sen06} as the sequences which can be computed by deterministic pushdown automata of level $k$. This definition has been extended to sequences of {\\em words} indexed by {\\em words} in \\cite{Sen07,Fer-Mar-Sen14}. We characterise here the sequences of level 3 as the compositions of two HDT0L-systems. Two applications are derived:   - the sequences of rational numbers of level 3 are characterised by polynomial recurrences   - the equality problem for sequences of rational numbers of level 3 is decidable.
