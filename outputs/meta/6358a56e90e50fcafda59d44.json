  "title": "EBEN: Extreme bandwidth extension network applied to speech signals\n  captured with noise-resilient body-conduction microphones",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present Extreme Bandwidth Extension Network (EBEN), a Generative Adversarial network (GAN) that enhances audio measured with body-conduction microphones. This type of capture equipment suppresses ambient noise at the expense of speech bandwidth, thereby requiring signal enhancement techniques to recover the wideband speech signal. EBEN leverages a multiband decomposition of the raw captured speech to decrease the data time-domain dimensions, and give better control over the full-band signal. This multiband representation is fed to a U-Net-like model, which adopts a combination of feature and adversarial losses to recover an enhanced audio signal. We also benefit from this original representation in the proposed discriminator architecture. Our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with a lightweight generator and real-time compatible operation. "
