  "abstract": "  We provide a GPU-friendly algorithm for obtaining all weak pseudo-manifolds whose facets are all in an input set of facets satisfying given conditions. We use it here to completely list up toric colorable seed PL-spheres with a few vertices implying the complete characterization of PL-spheres of dimension $n-1$ with $n+4$ vertices having maximal Buchstaber numbers.
