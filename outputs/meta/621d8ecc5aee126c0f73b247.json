  "abstract": "  We give a generalization of subspace codes by means of codes of modules over finite commutative chain rings. We define a new class of Sperner codes and use results from extremal combinatorics to prove the optimality of such codes in different cases. Moreover, we explain the connection with Bruhat-Tits buildings and show how our codes are the buildings' analogue of spherical codes in the Euclidean sense. "
