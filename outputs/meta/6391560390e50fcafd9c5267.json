  "abstract": "  Achieving multiple genres and long-term choreography sequences from given music is a challenging task, due to the lack of a multi-genre dataset. To tackle this problem,we propose a Multi Art Genre Intelligent Choreography Dataset (MagicDance). The data of MagicDance is captured from professional dancers assisted by motion capture technicians. It has a total of 8 hours 3D motioncapture human dances with paired music, and 16 different dance genres. To the best of our knowledge, MagicDance is the 3D dance dataset with the most genres. In addition, we find that the existing two types of methods (generation-based method and synthesis-based method) can only satisfy one of the diversity and duration, but they can complement to some extent. Based on this observation, we also propose a generation-synthesis choreography network (MagicNet), which cascades a Diffusion-based 3D Diverse Dance fragments Generation Network (3DGNet) and a Genre&Coherent aware Retrieval Module (GCRM). The former can generate various dance fragments from only one music clip. The latter is utilized to select the best dance fragment generated by 3DGNet and switch them into a complete dance according to the genre and coherent matching score. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the quality of MagicDance, and the state-of-the-art performance of MagicNet. "
