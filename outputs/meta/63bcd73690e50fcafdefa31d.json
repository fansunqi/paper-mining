  "abstract": "  Since the introduction of digital and computational pathology as a field, one of the major problems in the clinical application of algorithms has been the struggle to generalize well to examples outside the distribution of the training data. Existing work to address this in both pathology and natural images has focused almost exclusively on classification tasks. We explore and evaluate the robustness of the 7 best performing nuclear segmentation and classification models from the largest computational pathology challenge for this problem to date, the CoNIC challenge. We demonstrate that existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) models are robust towards compression artifacts but suffer substantial performance reduction when subjected to shifts in the color domain. We find that using stain normalization to address the domain shift problem can be detrimental to the model performance. On the other hand, neural style transfer is more consistent in improving test performance when presented with large color variations in the wild. "
