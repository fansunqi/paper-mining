  "title": "Knowledge Transfer For On-Device Speech Emotion Recognition with Neural\n  Structured Learning",
  "abstract": "  Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a popular research topic in human-computer interaction (HCI). As edge devices are rapidly springing up, applying SER to edge devices is promising for a huge number of HCI applications. Although deep learning has been investigated to improve the performance of SER by training complex models, the memory space and computational capability of edge devices represents a constraint for embedding deep learning models. We propose a neural structured learning (NSL) framework through building synthesized graphs. An SER model is trained on a source dataset and used to build graphs on a target dataset. A relatively lightweight model is then trained with the speech samples and graphs together as the input. Our experiments demonstrate that training a lightweight SER model on the target dataset with speech samples and graphs can not only produce small SER models, but also enhance the model performance over models with speech samples only and those with classic transfer learning strategies.
