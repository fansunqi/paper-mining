  "abstract": "  When creating multi-channel time-series datasets for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), researchers are faced with the issue of subject selection criteria. It is unknown what physical characteristics and/or soft-biometrics, such as age, height, and weight, need to be taken into account to train a classifier to achieve robustness towards heterogeneous populations in the training and testing data. This contribution statistically curates the training data to assess to what degree the physical characteristics of humans influence HAR performance. We evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network on two HAR datasets that vary in the sensors, activities, and recording for time-series HAR. The training data is intentionally biased with respect to human characteristics to determine the features that impact motion behaviour. The evaluations brought forth the impact of the subjects' characteristics on HAR. Thus, providing insights regarding the robustness of the classifier with respect to heterogeneous populations. The study is a step forward in the direction of fair and trustworthy artificial intelligence by attempting to quantify representation bias in multi-channel time series HAR data. "
