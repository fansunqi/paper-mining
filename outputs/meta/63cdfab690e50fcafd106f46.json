  "title": "Ideal presentations and numberings of some classes of effective\n  quasi-Polish spaces",
  "abstract": "  The well known ideal presentations of countably based domains were recently extended to (effective) quasi-Polish spaces. Continuing these investigations, we explore some classes of effective quasi-Polish spaces. In particular, we prove an effective version of the domain-characterization of quasi-Polish spaces, describe effective extensions of quasi-Polish topologies, discover natural numberings of classes of effective quasi-Polish spaces, estimate the complexity of the (effective) homeomorphism relation and of some classes of spaces w.r.t. these numberings, and investigate degree spectra of continuous domains.
