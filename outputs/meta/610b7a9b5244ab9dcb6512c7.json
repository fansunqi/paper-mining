  "title": "Point Discriminative Learning for Data-efficient 3D Point Cloud Analysis",
  "abstract": "  3D point cloud analysis has drawn a lot of research attention due to its wide applications. However, collecting massive labelled 3D point cloud data is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This calls for data-efficient learning methods. In this work we propose PointDisc, a point discriminative learning method to leverage self-supervisions for data-efficient 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. PointDisc imposes a novel point discrimination loss on the middle and global level features produced by the backbone network. This point discrimination loss enforces learned features to be consistent with points belonging to the corresponding local shape region and inconsistent with randomly sampled noisy points. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D object classification, 3D semantic and part segmentation, showing the benefits of PointDisc for data-efficient learning. Detailed analysis demonstrate that PointDisc learns unsupervised features that well capture local and global geometry. "
