  "abstract": "  Quantum Annealing (QA) uses quantum fluctuations to search for a global minimum of an optimization-type problem faster than classical computers. To meet the demand for future internet traffic and mitigate the spectrum scarcity, this work presents the QA-aided maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks as an alternative to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) method. The practical system parameters such as channel randomness and possible transmit power levels are taken into account for all individual signals of all involved users. The brute force (BF) and SIC signal detection methods are taken as benchmarks in the analysis. The QA-assisted ML decoder results in the same BER performance as the BF method outperforming the SIC technique, but the execution of QA takes more time than BF and SIC. The parallelization technique can be a potential aid to fasten the execution process. This will pave the way to fully realize the potential of QA decoders in NOMA systems. "
