  "abstract": "  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which bind peptides for presentation on the cell surface, play an important role in cell-mediated immunity. In light of developing databases and technologies over the years, significant progress has been made in research on peptide binding affinity calculation. Several in techniques have been developed to predict peptide binding to MHC class I. Most of the research on MHC Class I due to its nature brings better performance and more. Considering the use of different methods and different technologies, and the approach of similar methods on different proteins, a classification was created according to the binding affinity of protein peptides.
