  "title": "A Majority Logic Synthesis Framework For Single Flux Quantum Circuits",
  "abstract": "  Exascale computing and its associated applications have required increasing degrees of efficiency. Semiconductor-Transistor-based Circuits (STbCs) have struggled with increasing the GHz frequency while dealing with power dissipation issues. Emerging as an alternative to STbC, single flux quantum (SFQ) logic in the superconducting electrons (SCE) technology promises higher-speed clock frequencies at ultra-low power consumption. However, its quantized pulse-based operation and high environmental requirements, process variations and other SFQ-specific non-idealities are the significant causes of logic error for SFQ circuits. A suitable method of minimizing the impact of the afore-mentioned error sources is to minimize the number of Josephson Junctions (JJs) in the circuits, hence an essential part of the design flow of large SFQ circuits. This paper presents a novel SFQ logic synthesis framework that given a netlist, offers an automated mapping solution including majority (MAJ) logic with the goal of minimizing the number of JJs, while catering to the unique characteristics and requirements of the design. Our experiments confirm that our synthesis framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art academic SFQ technology mapper, namely reducing the number of JJs on average by 35.0%. "
