  "abstract": "  The decentralized patch distribution mechanism holds significant promise as an alternative to its centralized counterpart. For the purpose of accurately evaluating the performance of the decentralized patch distribution mechanism and based on the exact SIPS model that accurately captures the average dynamics of the interaction between viruses and patches, a new virus-patch interacting model, which is known as the generic SIPS model, is proposed. This model subsumes the linear SIPS model. The dynamics of the generic SIPS model is studied comprehensively. In particular, a set of criteria for the final extinction or/and long-term survival of viruses or/and patches are presented. Some conditions for the linear SIPS model to accurately capture the average dynamics of the virus-patch interaction are empirically found. As a consequence, the linear SIPS model can be adopted as a standard model for assessing the performance of the distributed patch distribution mechanism, provided the proper conditions are satisfied.
