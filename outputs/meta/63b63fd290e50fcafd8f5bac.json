  "title": "Noise Reduction in Medical Images",
  "abstract": "  Objectives: Analyze the types of studies and algorithms that are most applied, Identify the anatomical regions treated. Determine the application of parallel techniques used in studies carried out between 2010 and 2022 in research on noise reduction in medical images. Methodology: A systematic review of the literature on noise reduction in medical images in the last 12 years was carried out. The observation technique was applied to extract the information and the indicators (type of study, treated anatomical region, algorithm and or method and the application of parallel computing) were recorded in a data sheet. Results: Most of the studies have been developed in anatomical regions such as: Brain, Bones, Heart, Breast, Lung and Visual system. In the articles investigated, 14 are applied through parallel computing. Conclution: Noise reduction in medical images can contribute to better quality images and thus make a more accurate and effective diagnosis. "
