  "title": "Fourier theoretic inequalities for inclusion of simple C*-algebras",
  "abstract": "  This paper originates from a naive attempt to establish various non-commutative Fourier theoretic inequalities for an inclusion of simple C*-algebras equipped with a conditional expectation of index-finite type. In this setting, we discuss the Hausdorff-Young inequality and Young's inequality. As a consequence, we prove the Hirschman-Beckner uncertainty principle and Donoho-Stark uncertainty principle. Our results generalize some of the results of Jiang, Liu and Wu [Noncommutative uncertainty principle, J. Funct. Anal., 270(1): 264--311, 2016]. "
