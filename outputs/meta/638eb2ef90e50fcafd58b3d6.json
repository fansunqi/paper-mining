  "title": "FeSAC: Federated Learning-Based Soft Actor-Critic Traffic Offloading in\n  Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network",
  "abstract": "  With the increase of intelligent devices leading to increasing demand for traffic, traffic offloading has become a challenging problem. The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a superior network architecture to solve this problem. The existing research on SAGIN traffic offloading only considers the single-layer satellite network in the space network. To further expand the resource pool of traffic offloading in SAGIN, we extend the single-layer satellite network into a double-layer satellite network composed of low-orbit satellites (LEO) and high-orbit satellites (GEO). And re-model a four-layer SAGIN architecture consisting of the ground network, the air network, LEO and GEO. Furthermore, we propose a novel Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FeSAC) traffic offloading method with positive environmental exploration to accommodate this dynamic and complex four-layer SAGIN architecture. The FeSAC method uses federated learning to train traffic offloading nodes and then aggregate the training results to obtain the best traffic offloading strategy. The simulation results show that under the four-layer SAGIN, our proposed method can better adapt to the network environment changes by nodes mobility and is better than the existing traffic offloading methods in throughput, packet loss, and transmission delay.
