  "abstract": "  Mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications extended in the metaverse could provide mixed and immersive experiences by amalgamating the virtual and physical world. However, the joint consideration between MAR and metaverse seeks the reliable and high quality support for foreground interactions and background contents from these applications, which intensifies their consumption in energy, caching and computing resources. To tackle these challenges, a more flexible request assignment and resource allocation with more efficient processing are proposed in this paper through anchoring decomposed metaverse AR services at different edge nodes and proactively caching background metaverse region models embedded with target Augmented Reality Objects (AROs).Advanced terminals are also considered to further reduce service delay at an acceptable cost of energy consumption.We then propose and solve a joint optimization problem that explicitly considers the balance between service delay and energy consumption under the constraint of user perception quality in a mobility event.By also explicitly taking into account capabilities of user terminals, the proposed optimized scheme is compared to its terminal oblivious version in this paper. According to a wide set of numerical investigations, the proposed scheme owns advantages in service latency and energy efficiency over other nominal baseline schemes which neglect capacities of terminals, user physical mobility, service decomposition and the inherent multi modality of the metaverse MAR service.
