  "abstract": "  A common approach to synthetic data is to sample from a fitted model. We show that under general assumptions, this approach results in a sample with inefficient estimators and whose joint distribution is inconsistent with the true distribution. Motivated by this, we propose a general method of producing synthetic data, which is widely applicable for parametric models, has asymptotically efficient summary statistics, and is both easily implemented and highly computationally efficient. Our approach allows for the construction of both partially synthetic datasets, which preserve certain summary statistics, as well as fully synthetic data which satisfy the strong guarantee of differential privacy (DP), both with the same asymptotic guarantees. We also provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the distribution from our procedure converges to the true distribution. Besides our focus on synthetic data, our procedure can also be used to perform approximate hypothesis tests in the presence of intractable likelihood functions. "
