  "title": "A Survey of research in Deep Learning for Robotics for Undergraduate\n  research interns",
  "abstract": "  Our goal is to survey a number of research internship projects in the broad area of 'Deep Learning as applied to Robotics' and present a concise view for the benefit of aspiring student interns. Over the last several years use cases for robotics based solutions have diversified from factory floors to domestic applications. In parallel, Deep Learning approaches are replacing traditional techniques in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech processing, etc. and are delivering robust results. In this paper, we survey the research work done by Robotic Institute Summer Scholars (RISS), CMU as a part of research internship. We particularly focus on papers that use deep learning to solve core robotic problems and also robotic solutions. We trust this would be useful particularly for internship aspirants for the Robotics Institute, CMU "
