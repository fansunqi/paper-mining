  "title": "Sparse Geometric Set Systems and the Beck-Fiala Conjecture",
  "abstract": "  We investigate the combinatorial discrepancy of geometric set systems having bounded shallow cell complexity in the \\emph{Beck-Fiala} setting, where each point belongs to at most $t$ ranges. For set systems with shallow cell complexity $\\psi(m,k)=g(m)k^{c}$, where $(i)$ $g(m) = o(m^{\\varepsilon})$ for any $\\varepsilon\\in (0,1],$ $(ii)$ $\\psi$ is non-decreasing in $m$, and $(iii)$ $c>0$ is independent of $m$ and $k$, we get a discrepancy bound of   \\[ O\\left(\\sqrt{\\left(\\log n+\\left(t^{c}g(n)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+c}}\\right)\\log n}\\right).\\]   For $t=\\omega(\\log^2 n)$, in several cases, such as for set systems of points and half-planes / disks / pseudo-disks in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, points and orthants in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ etc., these bounds are $o(\\sqrt{t})$, which verifies (and improves upon) the conjectured bound of Beck and Fiala~\\emph{(Disc. Appl. Math., 1981)}.   Our bounds are obtained by showing the existence of \\emph{matchings with low crossing number}, using the multiplicative weights update method of Welzl \\emph{(SoCG, 1988)}, together with the recent bound of Mustafa \\emph{(Disc. Comp. Geom., 2015)} on \\emph{shallow packings} of set systems in terms of their shallow cell complexity. For set systems of shallow cell complexity $\\psi(m,k)=m^{c_1}g(m)k^{c}$, we obtain matchings with crossing number at most   \\[ O\\left(\\left(n^{c_1}g(n)t^{c}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+c_1+c}}\\right).\\]   These are of independent interest.
