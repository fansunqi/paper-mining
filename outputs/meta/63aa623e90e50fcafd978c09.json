  "abstract": "  Authentication plays a significant part in dealing with security in public and private sectors such as healthcare systems, banking system, transportation system and law and security. Biometric technology has grown quickly recently, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and identity. Formerly, authentication process has depended on security measures like passcodes, identity fobs, and fingerprints. On the other hand, as just a consequence of these precautions, theft has increased in frequency. In response, biometric security was created, in which the identification of a person is based on features derived from the physiological and behavioral traits of a human body using biometric system. Biometric technology gadgets are available to the public as they are embedded on computer systems, electronic devices, mobile phones, and other consumer electronics. As the fraudulent is increasing demand and use of biometric electronic devices has increased. As a consequence, it may be possible to confirm a person's distinct identification. The goal of this study is to examine developments in biometric systems in the disciplines of medicine and engineering. The study will present the perspectives and different points of view of the secondary data, highlighting the need for more in-depth understanding and application of biometric technology to promote its development in the digital era. The study's findings may inspire people and businesses to more effectively incorporate biometric technologies in order to reduce the risks to data and identity security. "
