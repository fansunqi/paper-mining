  "title": "Treedepth vs circumference",
  "abstract": "  The circumference of a graph $G$ is the length of a longest cycle in $G$, or $+\\infty$ if $G$ has no cycle. Birmel\\'e (2003) showed that the treewidth of a graph $G$ is at most its circumference minus $1$. We strengthen this result for $2$-connected graphs as follows: If $G$ is $2$-connected, then its treedepth is at most its circumference. The bound is best possible and improves on an earlier quadratic upper bound due to Marshall and Wood (2015). "
