  "abstract": "  During the application of chemical pesticides, distance requirements have to be considered. However, these have to be determined and considered by the farmer manually. To support the farmer the Pesticide Application Manager (PAM)-Projects were conducted and a decision support system was developed. A part of this system, the distance requirements service was developed at the KTBL. To provide this service, the PAM-prozess is conducted: the pesticide registration data provided via REST-API is crawled, then the data is mapped into an ontology using rmlmapper and made availabe in a machine readable and application-independent form via a SPARQL-Endpoint.
