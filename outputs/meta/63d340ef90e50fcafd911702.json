  "title": "Hardware-Aware Automated Neural Minimization for Printed Multilayer\n  Perceptrons",
  "abstract": "  The demand of many application domains for flexibility, stretchability, and porosity cannot be typically met by the silicon VLSI technologies. Printed Electronics (PE) has been introduced as a candidate solution that can satisfy those requirements and enable the integration of smart devices on consumer goods at ultra low-cost enabling also in situ and ondemand fabrication. However, the large features sizes in PE constraint those efforts and prohibit the design of complex ML circuits due to area and power limitations. Though, classification is mainly the core task in printed applications. In this work, we examine, for the first time, the impact of neural minimization techniques, in conjunction with bespoke circuit implementations, on the area-efficiency of printed Multilayer Perceptron classifiers. Results show that for up to 5% accuracy loss up to 8x area reduction can be achieved. "
