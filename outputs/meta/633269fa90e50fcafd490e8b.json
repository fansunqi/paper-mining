  "title": "Learning Variational Models with Unrolling and Bilevel Optimization",
  "abstract": "  In this paper we consider the problem learning of variational models in the context of supervised learning via risk minimization. Our goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the two approaches of learning of variational models via bilevel optimization and via algorithm unrolling. The former considers the variational model as a lower level optimization problem below the risk minimization problem, while the latter replaces the lower level optimization problem by an algorithm that solves said problem approximately. Both approaches are used in practice, but, unrolling is much simpler from a computational point of view. To analyze and compare the two approaches, we consider a simple toy model, and compute all risks and the respective estimators explicitly. We show that unrolling can be better than the bilevel optimization approach, but also that the performance of unrolling can depend significantly on further parameters, sometimes in unexpected ways: While the stepsize of the unrolled algorithm matters a lot, the number of unrolled iterations only matters if the number is even or odd, and these two cases are notably different.
