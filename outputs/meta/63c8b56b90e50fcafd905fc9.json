  "abstract": "  This paper describes the active available bandwidth measurement tool DietTopp. It measures the available bandwidth and the link capacity on an end-to-end path having one bottleneck link. DietTopp is based on a simplified TOPP method. This paper describe and motivate the simplifications and assumptions made to TOPP. Further, the paper describes some of the DietTopp implementation issues. A first evaluation of DietTopp in a testbed scenario is made. Within this evaluation the performance and measurement accuracy of DietTopp is compared to the state-of-the-art tools Pathload and Pathrate. We show that DietTopp gives fast and accurate estimations of both the available bandwidth and the link capacity of the bottleneck link. "
