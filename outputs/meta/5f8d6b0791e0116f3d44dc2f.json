  "title": "Axiomatic Characterization of PageRank",
  "abstract": "  This paper examines the fundamental problem of identifying the most important nodes in a network. We use an axiomatic approach to this problem. Specifically, we propose six simple properties and prove that PageRank is the only centrality measure that satisfies all of them. Our work gives new conceptual and theoretical foundations of PageRank that can be used to determine suitability of this centrality measure in specific applications. "
