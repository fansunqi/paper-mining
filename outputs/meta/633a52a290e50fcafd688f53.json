  "abstract": "  Introduction. The stress response has both subjective, psychological and objectively measurable, biological components. Both of them can be expressed differently from person to person, complicating the development of a generic stress measurement model. This is further compounded by the lack of large, labeled datasets that can be utilized to build machine learning models for accurately detecting periods and levels of stress. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of stress detection and monitoring using wearable devices, and where applicable, machine learning techniques utilized.   Methods. This study reviewed published works contributing and/or using datasets designed for detecting stress and their associated machine learning methods, with a systematic review and meta-analysis of those that utilized wearable sensor data as stress biomarkers. The electronic databases of Google Scholar, Crossref, DOAJ and PubMed were searched for relevant articles and a total of 24 articles were identified and included in the final analysis. The reviewed works were synthesized into three categories of publicly available stress datasets, machine learning, and future research directions.   Results. A wide variety of study-specific test and measurement protocols were noted in the literature. A number of public datasets were identified that are labeled for stress detection. In addition, we discuss that previous works show shortcomings in areas such as their labeling protocols, lack of statistical power, validity of stress biomarkers, and generalization ability.   Conclusion. Generalization of existing machine learning models still require further study, and research in this area will continue to provide improvements as newer and more substantial datasets become available for study.
