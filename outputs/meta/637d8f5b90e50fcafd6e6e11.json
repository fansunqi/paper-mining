  "abstract": "  A deductive program synthesis tool takes a specification as input and derives a program that satisfies the specification. The drawback of this approach is that search spaces for such correct programs tend to be enormous, making it difficult to derive correct programs within a realistic timeout. To speed up such program derivation, we improve the search strategy of a deductive program synthesis tool, SuSLik, using evolutionary computation. Our cross-validation shows that the improvement brought by evolutionary computation generalises to unforeseen problems. "
