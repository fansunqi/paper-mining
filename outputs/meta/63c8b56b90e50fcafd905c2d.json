  "title": "A data science and machine learning approach to continuous analysis of\n  Shakespeare's plays",
  "abstract": "The availability of quantitative text analysis methods has provided new ways\nof analyzing literature in a manner that was not available in the\npre-information era. Here we apply comprehensive machine learning analysis to\nthe work of William Shakespeare. The analysis shows clear changes in the style\nof writing over time, with the most significant changes in the sentence length,\nfrequency of adjectives and adverbs, and the sentiments expressed in the text.\nApplying machine learning to make a stylometric prediction of the year of the\nplay shows a Pearson correlation of 0.71 between the actual and predicted year,\nindicating that Shakespeare's writing style as reflected by the quantitative\nmeasurements changed over time. Additionally, it shows that the stylometrics of\nsome of the plays is more similar to plays written either before or after the\nyear they were written. For instance, Romeo and Juliet is dated 1596, but is\nmore similar in stylometrics to plays written by Shakespeare after 1600. The\nsource code for the analysis is available for free download."
