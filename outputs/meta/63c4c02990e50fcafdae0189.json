  "abstract": "  Geomechanical monitoring of a rock massif is an actively developing branch of geomechanics. It is almost impossible to single out a methodology and approaches for data collection and analysis in developing seismic monitoring systems. In the process of mining in rock massif, changes in the state of structural inhomogeneities are most clearly manifested. Existing natural structural inhomogeneities are revealed, there are movements in discontinuous disturbances, and new technogenic disturbances are formed, which are accompanied by a change in the natural stress state of various blocks of the massif. An important task is to develop a mining forecasting model that can take into account the structural heterogeneity of the rock massif and select the necessary forecast horizon depending on monitoring data The developed method of evaluating the results of monitoring geomechanical processes in the rock massif allowed us to forecast of zones of possible rock bursts.
