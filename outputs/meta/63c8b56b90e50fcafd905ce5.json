  "abstract": "  We define a new, partizan, loopy combinatorial game, Forced-Capture Hnefatafl, similar to Hnefatafl, except that players are forced to make capturing moves when available. We show that this game is PSPACE-hard using a reduction from Constraint Logic, making progress towards classifying proper Hnefatafl. "
