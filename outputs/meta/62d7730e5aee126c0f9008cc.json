  "title": "Machine Learning in Orbit Estimation: a Survey",
  "abstract": "  Since the late 1950s, when the first artificial satellite was launched, the number of Resident Space Objects has steadily increased. It is estimated that around one million objects larger than one cm are currently orbiting the Earth, with only thirty thousand larger than ten cm being tracked. To avert a chain reaction of collisions, known as Kessler Syndrome, it is essential to accurately track and predict debris and satellites' orbits. Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically with less than one meter. This failure is usually due to uncertainty around the state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object. Operators can enhance Orbit Prediction accuracy by deriving unmeasured objects' characteristics and improving non-conservative forces' effects by leveraging data-driven techniques, such as Machine Learning. In this survey, we provide an overview of the work in applying Machine Learning for Orbit Determination, Orbit Prediction, and atmospheric density modeling. "
