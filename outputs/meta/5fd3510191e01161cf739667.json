  "abstract": "  We introduce a novel covariance estimator for portfolio selection that adapts to the non-stationary or persistent heteroskedastic environments of financial time series by employing exponentially weighted averages and nonlinearly shrinking the sample eigenvalues through cross-validation. Our estimator is structure agnostic, transparent, and computationally feasible in large dimensions. By correcting the biases in the sample eigenvalues and aligning our estimator to more recent risk, we demonstrate that our estimator performs well in large dimensions against existing state-of-the-art static and dynamic covariance shrinkage estimators through simulations and with an empirical application in active portfolio management.
