  "title": "A Field Trial Study of 5G Quality of Service: A Case of BTS Skytrain\n  Station",
  "abstract": "  This article aims to present the results from a study of the quality of service of 5G networks provided by two major 5G network providers, using a field trial approach within 60 BTS SkyTrain stations. The results obtained from the tests using 4 applications on a 5G mobile phone showed that the performance of 5G networks provided by both operators are different. When calculated for the average values, it was found both operators had the download speed of 240.3 Mbps and the upload speed of 87.3 Mbps. Besides these values, it was also found the average latency, the average jitter and the average loss from both major operators that are 19 ms, 8 ms and 0.299 % respectively. Comparing the average values derived from the results of this study with the results of another study in the Asia-Pacific region that was undertaken during the similar period of time, it was found that the Bangkok download speed is ranked in the 4th place, whereas the upload speed is ranked in the 1st place. However, it is noted that this study only covered the area of BTS SkyTrain stations. In the future, the study should be extended to cover other parts of the Bangkok metropolitan area, and other provinces. In addition, the study should be conducted by a credible organization. "
