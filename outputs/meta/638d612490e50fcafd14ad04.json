  "abstract": "  We present VeriX, a system for producing optimal robust explanations and generating counterfactuals along decision boundaries of machine learning models. We build such explanations and counterfactuals iteratively using constraint solving techniques and a heuristic based on feature-level sensitivity ranking. We evaluate our method on image recognition benchmarks and a real-world scenario of autonomous aircraft taxiing. "
