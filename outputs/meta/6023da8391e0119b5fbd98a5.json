  "abstract": "  We consider reliable and secure communication over intersymbol interference wiretap channels (ISI-WTCs). In particular, we first derive an achievable secure rate for ISI-WTCs without imposing any constraints on the input distribution. Afterwards, we focus on the setup where the input distribution of the ISI-WTC is constrained to be a time-invariant finite-order Markov chain. Optimizing the parameters of this Markov chain toward maximizing the achievable secure rates is a computationally intractable problem in general, and so, toward finding a local maximum, we propose an iterative algorithm that at every iteration replaces the secure rate function with a suitable~surrogate function whose maximum can be found efficiently. Although the secure rates achieved in the unconstrained setup are potentially larger than the secure rates achieved in the constrained setup, the latter setup has the advantage of leading to efficient algorithms for estimating and optimizing the achievable secure rates, and also has the benefit of being the basis of efficient coding schemes.
