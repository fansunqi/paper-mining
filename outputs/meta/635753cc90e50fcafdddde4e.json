  "title": "Data Augmentation for Automated Essay Scoring using Transformer Models",
  "abstract": "  Automated essay scoring is one of the most important problem in Natural Language Processing. It has been explored for a number of years, and it remains partially solved. In addition to its economic and educational usefulness, it presents research problems. Transfer learning has proved to be beneficial in NLP. Data augmentation techniques have also helped build state-of-the-art models for automated essay scoring. Many works in the past have attempted to solve this problem by using RNNs, LSTMs, etc. This work examines the transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, etc. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer models and data augmentation for automated essay grading across many topics using a single model.
