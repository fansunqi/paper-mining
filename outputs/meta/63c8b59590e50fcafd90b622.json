  "title": "Distribution Aligned Feature Clustering for Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image\n  Retrieval",
  "abstract": "  Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a challenging cross-modal retrieval task. In prior arts, the retrieval is conducted by sorting the distance between the query sketch and each image in the gallery. However, the domain gap and the zero-shot setting make neural networks hard to generalize. This paper tackles the challenges from a new perspective: utilizing gallery image features. We propose a Cluster-then-Retrieve (ClusterRetri) method that performs clustering on the gallery images and uses the cluster centroids as proxies for retrieval. Furthermore, a distribution alignment loss is proposed to align the image and sketch features with a common Gaussian distribution, reducing the domain gap. Despite its simplicity, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on popular datasets, e.g., up to 31% and 39% relative improvement of mAP@all on the Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.
