  "title": "Improving Reflexive Surfaces Efficiency with Genetic Algorithms",
  "abstract": "  We propose using a Genetic Algorithm to improve the efficiency of reflexive surfaces in devices where the receiver's position is different from the classic parabolic antenna. With this technique, we show that we can improve the efficiency of the ARAPUCA photodetector. "
