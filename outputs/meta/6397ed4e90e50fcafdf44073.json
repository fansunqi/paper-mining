  "title": "Effective Seed-Guided Topic Discovery by Integrating Multiple Types of\n  Contexts",
  "abstract": "  Instead of mining coherent topics from a given text corpus in a completely unsupervised manner, seed-guided topic discovery methods leverage user-provided seed words to extract distinctive and coherent topics so that the mined topics can better cater to the user's interest. To model the semantic correlation between words and seeds for discovering topic-indicative terms, existing seed-guided approaches utilize different types of context signals, such as document-level word co-occurrences, sliding window-based local contexts, and generic linguistic knowledge brought by pre-trained language models. In this work, we analyze and show empirically that each type of context information has its value and limitation in modeling word semantics under seed guidance, but combining three types of contexts (i.e., word embeddings learned from local contexts, pre-trained language model representations obtained from general-domain training, and topic-indicative sentences retrieved based on seed information) allows them to complement each other for discovering quality topics. We propose an iterative framework, SeedTopicMine, which jointly learns from the three types of contexts and gradually fuses their context signals via an ensemble ranking process. Under various sets of seeds and on multiple datasets, SeedTopicMine consistently yields more coherent and accurate topics than existing seed-guided topic discovery approaches. "
