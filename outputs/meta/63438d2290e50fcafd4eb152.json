  "abstract": "  The complexity of the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})$ is largely unknown, even for symmetric $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, except for the case when $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are Boolean.   First, we establish a dichotomy for $\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})$ where $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ are symmetric, $\\mathbf{B}$ is functional (i.e. any $r-1$ elements of an $r$-ary tuple uniquely determines the last one), and $(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})$ satisfies technical conditions we introduce called dependency and additivity. This result implies a dichotomy for $\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})$ with $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}$ symmetric and $\\mathbf{B}$ functional if (i) $\\mathbf{A}$ is Boolean, or (ii) $\\mathbf{A}$ is a hypergraph of a small uniformity, or (iii) $\\mathbf{A}$ has a relation $R^{\\mathbf{A}}$ of arity at least 3 such that the hypergraph diameter of $(A, R^{\\mathbf{A}})$ is at most 1.   Second, we show that for $\\operatorname{PCSP}(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B})$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ contain a single relation, $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies a technical condition called balancedness, and $\\mathbf{B}$ is arbitrary, the combined basic linear programming relaxation (BLP) and the affine integer programming relaxation (AIP) is no more powerful than the (in general strictly weaker) AIP relaxation. Balanced $\\mathbf{A}$ include symmetric $\\mathbf{A}$ or, more generally, $\\mathbf{A}$ preserved by a transitive permutation group. "
