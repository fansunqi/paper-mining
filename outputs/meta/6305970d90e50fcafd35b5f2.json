  "title": "Convex mixed-integer optimization with Frank-Wolfe methods",
  "abstract": "  Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization encompasses a broad class of problems that present both theoretical and computational challenges. We propose a new type of method to solve these problems based on a branch-and-bound algorithm with convex node relaxations. These relaxations are solved with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm over the convex hull of mixed-integer feasible points instead of the continuous relaxation via calls to a mixed-integer linear solver as the linear oracle. The proposed method computes feasible solutions while working on a single representation of the polyhedral constraints, leveraging the full extent of mixed-integer linear solvers without an outer approximation scheme and can exploit inexact solutions of node subproblems.
