  "abstract": "  We provide the first $\\mathit{constant}$-$\\mathit{round}$ construction of post-quantum non-malleable commitments under the minimal assumption that $\\mathit{post}$-$\\mathit{quantum}$ $\\mathit{one}$-$\\mathit{way}$ $\\mathit{functions}$ exist. We achieve the standard notion of non-malleability with respect to commitments. Prior constructions required $\\Omega(\\log^*\\lambda)$ rounds under the same assumption.   We achieve our results through a new technique for constant-round non-malleable commitments which is easier to use in the post-quantum setting. The technique also yields an almost elementary proof of security for constant-round non-malleable commitments in the classical setting, which may be of independent interest.   When combined with existing work, our results yield the first constant-round quantum-secure multiparty computation for both classical and quantum functionalities $\\mathit{in}$ $\\mathit{the}$ $\\mathit{plain}$ $\\mathit{model}$, under the $\\mathit{polynomial}$ hardness of quantum fully-homomorphic encryption and quantum learning with errors.
