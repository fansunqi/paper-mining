  "abstract": "  We develop an analytical framework to examine the line-of-sight (LOS) coverage area in vehicular networks with roadside units (RSU) and vehicle relays. In practical deployment scenarios, RSUs and vehicle relays are spatially correlated and we characterize this by employing Cox point processes to model the locations of RSUs and vehicle relays simultaneously. Leveraging the random blockage model, we model the LOS coverage area as Boolean models on these Cox point processes. The LOS coverage area is then evaluated by its area fraction. We show that relays can increase the area fraction of LOS coverage by nearly 50\\% even when RSUs and relays are spatially correlated. By presenting a stochastic geometry model for a vehicular network with RSUs and relays and then by providing a tool to capture its LOS coverage, our work assesses the viability of vehicle relays for modern vehicular networks exploiting LOS coverage.
