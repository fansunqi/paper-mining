  "abstract": "  Semantic editing of images is the fundamental goal of computer vision. Although deep learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are capable of producing high-quality images, they often do not have an inherent way of editing generated images semantically. Recent studies have investigated a way of manipulating the latent variable to determine the images to be generated. However, methods that assume linear semantic arithmetic have certain limitations in terms of the quality of image editing, whereas methods that discover nonlinear semantic pathways provide non-commutative editing, which is inconsistent when applied in different orders. This study proposes a novel method called deep curvilinear editing (DeCurvEd) to determine semantic commuting vector fields on the latent space. We theoretically demonstrate that owing to commutativity, the editing of multiple attributes depends only on the quantities and not on the order. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that compared to previous methods, the nonlinear and commutative nature of DeCurvEd facilitates the disentanglement of image attributes and provides higher-quality editing.
