  "title": "Relaxed N-Pairs Loss for Context-Aware Recommendations of Television\n  Content",
  "abstract": "  This paper studies context-aware recommendations in the television domain by proposing a deep learning-based method for learning joint context-content embeddings (JCCE). The method builds on recent developments within recommendations using latent representations and deep metric learning, in order to effectively represent contextual settings of viewing situations as well as available content in a shared latent space. This embedding space is used for exploring relevant content in various viewing settings by applying an N-pairs loss objective as well as a relaxed variant proposed in this paper. Experiments confirm the recommendation ability of JCCE, achieving improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further experiments display useful structures in the learned embeddings that can be used for gaining valuable knowledge of underlying variables in the relationship between contextual settings and content properties.
