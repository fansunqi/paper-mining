  "abstract": "  Endoluminal reconstruction using flow diverters represents a novel paradigm for the minimally invasive treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The configuration assumed by these very dense braided stents once deployed within the parent vessel is not easily predictable and medical volumetric images alone may be insufficient to plan the treatment satisfactorily. Therefore, here we propose a fast and accurate machine learning and reduced order modelling framework, based on finite element simulations, to assist practitioners in the planning and interventional stages. It consists of a first classification step to determine a priori whether a simulation will be successful (good conformity between stent and vessel) or not from a clinical perspective, followed by a regression step that provides an approximated solution of the deployed stent configuration. The latter is achieved using a non-intrusive reduced order modelling scheme that combines the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm and Gaussian process regression. The workflow was validated on an idealised intracranial artery with a saccular aneurysm and the effect of six geometrical and surgical parameters on the outcome of stent deployment was studied. The two-step workflow allows the classification of deployment conditions with up to 95% accuracy and real-time prediction of the stent deployed configuration with an average prediction error never greater than the spatial resolution of 3D rotational angiography (0.15 mm). These results are promising as they demonstrate the ability of these techniques to achieve simulations within a few milliseconds while retaining the mechanical realism and predictability of the stent deployed configuration.
