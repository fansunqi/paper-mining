  "title": "Analysis and Design of VANET Protocols for Srinagar City",
  "abstract": "  Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is subclass of mobile ad-hoc network which is vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication environment, where nodes involve themselves as servers and/or clients to exchange and share information. VANET have some unique characteristics like high dynamic topology, frequent disconnections, restricted topology etc, so it need special class of routing protocol. To simulate the VANET scenarios we require two types of simulators, traffic simulator for generating traffic and network simulator. In this project I created a sample scenario of VANET for AODV, DSDV, DSR routing protocols. I have used SUMO for generating traffic mobility files and NS-3 for testing performance of routing protocols on the mobility files created using Traffic simulator SUMO. "
