  "title": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Empowered Self-Interference\n  Cancellation for 6G Full-Duplex MIMO Communication Systems",
  "abstract": "  Substantially increasing wireless traffic and extending serving coverage is required with the advent of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is widely considered as a promising technique which is capable of improving the system sum rate and energy efficiency. Moreover, full-duplex (FD) multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) transmission provides simultaneous transmit and received signals, which theoretically provides twice of spectrum efficiency. However, the self-interference (SI) in FD system is a challenging task requiring high-overhead cancellation, which can be resolved by configuring appropriate phase shifts of RIS. This paper has proposed an RIS-empowered full-duplex interference cancellation (RFIC) scheme in order to alleviate the severe interference in an RIS-FD system. We consider the interference minimization of RIS-FD MIMO while guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) of whole system. The closed-form solution of RIS phase shifts is theoretically derived with the discussion of different numbers of RIS elements and receiving antennas. Simulation results reveal that the proposed RFIC scheme outperforms existing benchmarks with more than 50% of performance gain of sum rate. "
