  "abstract": "  A time series is a sequence of sequentially ordered real values in time. Time series classification (TSC) is the task of assigning a time series to one of a set of predefined classes, usually based on a model learned from examples. Dictionary-based methods for TSC rely on counting the frequency of certain patterns in time series and are important components of the currently most accurate TSC ensembles. One of the early dictionary-based methods was WEASEL, which at its time achieved SotA results while also being very fast. However, it is outperformed both in terms of speed and accuracy by other methods. Furthermore, its design leads to an unpredictably large memory footprint, making it inapplicable for many applications.   In this paper, we present WEASEL 2.0, a complete overhaul of WEASEL based on two recent advancements in TSC: Dilation and ensembling of randomized hyper-parameter settings. These two techniques allow WEASEL 2.0 to work with a fixed-size memory footprint while at the same time improving accuracy. Compared to 15 other SotA methods on the UCR benchmark set, WEASEL 2.0 is significantly more accurate than other dictionary methods and not significantly worse than the currently best methods. Actually, it achieves the highest median accuracy over all data sets, and it performs best in 5 out of 12 problem classes. We thus believe that WEASEL 2.0 is a viable alternative for current TSC and also a potentially interesting input for future ensembles. "
