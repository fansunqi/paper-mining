  "title": "Binary Classification for High Dimensional Data using Supervised\n  Non-Parametric Ensemble Method",
  "abstract": "  High dimensional data for classification does create many difficulties for machine learning algorithms. The generalization can be done using ensemble learning methods such as bagging based supervised non-parametric random forest algorithm. In this paper we solve the problem of binary classification for high dimensional data using random forest for polycystic ovary syndrome dataset. We have performed the implementation and provided a detailed visualization of the data for general inference. The training accuracy that we have achieved is 95.6% and validation accuracy over 91.74% respectively. "
