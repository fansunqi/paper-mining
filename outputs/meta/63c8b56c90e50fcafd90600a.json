  "abstract": "The sense of belonging to a community is a basic human need that impacts an\nindividuals behavior, long-term engagement, and job satisfaction, as revealed\nby research in disciplines such as psychology, healthcare, and education.\nDespite much research on how to retain developers in Open Source Software\nprojects and other virtual, peer-production communities, there is a paucity of\nresearch investigating what might contribute to a sense of belonging in these\ncommunities. To that end, we develop a theoretical model that seeks to\nunderstand the link between OSS developer motives and a Sense of Virtual\nCommunity. We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel\ndeveloper community, using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results\nfor this case study show that intrinsic motivations - social or hedonic motives\n- are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an\nauthoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of\nvirtual community. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for open source\nprojects to foster a sense of virtual community, with a view to retaining\ncontributors and improving projects sustainability."
