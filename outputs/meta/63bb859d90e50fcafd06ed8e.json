  "abstract": "  Advancements in technologies related to working with omics data require novel computation methods to fully leverage information and help develop a better understanding of human diseases. This paper studies the effects of introducing graph contrastive learning to help leverage graph structure and information to produce better representations for downstream classification tasks for multi-omics datasets. We present a learnining framework named Multi-Omics Graph Contrastive Learner(MOGCL) which outperforms several aproaches for integrating multi-omics data for supervised learning tasks. We show that pre-training graph models with a contrastive methodology along with fine-tuning it in a supervised manner is an efficient strategy for multi-omics data classification. "
