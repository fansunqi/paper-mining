  "abstract": "  With the rapid growth of machine learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) are now being used in numerous domains. Unfortunately, DNNs are \"black-boxes\", and cannot be interpreted by humans, which is a substantial concern in safety-critical systems. To mitigate this issue, researchers have begun working on explainable AI (XAI) methods, which can identify a subset of input features that are the cause of a DNN's decision for a given input. Most existing techniques are heuristic, and cannot guarantee the correctness of the explanation provided. In contrast, recent and exciting attempts have shown that formal methods can be used to generate provably correct explanations. Although these methods are sound, the computational complexity of the underlying verification problem limits their scalability; and the explanations they produce might sometimes be overly complex. Here, we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations. We (1) suggest an efficient, verification-based method for finding minimal explanations, which constitute a provable approximation of the global, minimum explanation; (2) show how DNN verification can assist in calculating lower and upper bounds on the optimal explanation; (3) propose heuristics that significantly improve the scalability of the verification process; and (4) suggest the use of bundles, which allows us to arrive at more succinct and interpretable explanations. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, and produces explanations that are more useful to humans. We thus regard this work as a step toward leveraging verification technology in producing DNNs that are more reliable and comprehensible. "
