  "title": "A modular construction of type theories",
  "abstract": "  The lambda-Pi-calculus modulo theory is a logical framework in which many type systems can be expressed as theories. We present such a theory, the theory U, where proofs of several logical systems can be expressed. Moreover, we identify a sub-theory of U corresponding to each of these systems, and prove that, when a proof in U uses only symbols of a sub-theory, then it is a proof in that sub-theory. "
