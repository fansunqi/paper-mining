  "title": "Evaluating the acceptance of autonomous vehicles in the future",
  "abstract": "  The continuous advance of the automotive industry is leading to the emergence of more advanced driver assistance systems that enable the automation of certain tasks and that are undoubtedly aimed at achieving vehicles in which the driving task can be completely delegated. All these advances will bring changes in the paradigm of the automotive market, as is the case of insurance. For this reason, CESVIMAP and the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid are working on an Autonomous Testing pLatform for insurAnce reSearch (ATLAS) to study this technology and obtain first-hand knowledge about the responsibilities of each of the agents involved in the development of the vehicles of the future. This work gathers part of the advancements made in ATLAS, which have made it possible to have an autonomous vehicle with which to perform tests in real environments and demonstrations bringing the vehicle closer to future users. As a result of this work, and in collaboration with the Johannes Kepler University Linz, the impact, degree of acceptance and confidence of users in autonomous vehicles has been studied once they have taken a trip on board a fully autonomous vehicle such as ATLAS. This study has found that, while most users would be willing to use an autonomous vehicle, the same users are concerned about the use of this type of technology. Thus, understanding the reasons for this concern can help define the future of autonomous cars. "
