  "title": "A Survey on Transformers in Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "  Transformer has been considered the dominating neural architecture in NLP and CV, mostly under a supervised setting. Recently, a similar surge of using Transformers has appeared in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), but it is faced with unique design choices and challenges brought by the nature of RL. However, the evolution of Transformers in RL has not yet been well unraveled. Hence, in this paper, we seek to systematically review motivations and progress on using Transformers in RL, provide a taxonomy on existing works, discuss each sub-field, and summarize future prospects.
