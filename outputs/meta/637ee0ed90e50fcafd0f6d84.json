  "title": "A Complete Diagrammatic Calculus for Boolean Satisfiability",
  "abstract": "  We propose a calculus of string diagrams to reason about satisfiability of Boolean formulas, and prove it to be sound and complete. We then showcase our calculus in a few case studies. First, we consider SAT-solving. Second, we consider Horn clauses, which leads us to a new decision method for propositional logic programs equivalence under Herbrand model semantics. "
