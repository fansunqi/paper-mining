  "title": "One-Shot Achievable Secrecy Rate Regions for Quantum Interference\n  Wiretap Channel",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we want to derive achievable secrecy rate regions for quantum interference channel with classical inputs under one-shot setting. The main idea to this end is to use the combination of superposition and rate splitting for encoding scheme and constructing a decoding scheme based on simultaneous decoding. "
