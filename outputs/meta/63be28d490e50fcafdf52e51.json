  "abstract": "  Federated learning (FL) provides an effective machine learning (ML) architecture to protect data privacy in a distributed manner. However, the inevitable network asynchrony, the over-dependence on a central coordinator, and the lack of an open and fair incentive mechanism collectively hinder its further development. We propose \\textsc{IronForge}, a new generation of FL framework, that features a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based data structure and eliminates the need for central coordinators to achieve fully decentralized operations. \\textsc{IronForge} runs in a public and open network, and launches a fair incentive mechanism by enabling state consistency in the DAG, so that the system fits in networks where training resources are unevenly distributed. In addition, dedicated defense strategies against prevalent FL attacks on incentive fairness and data privacy are presented to ensure the security of \\textsc{IronForge}. Experimental results based on a newly developed testbed FLSim highlight the superiority of \\textsc{IronForge} to the existing prevalent FL frameworks under various specifications in performance, fairness, and security. To the best of our knowledge, \\textsc{IronForge} is the first secure and fully decentralized FL framework that can be applied in open networks with realistic network and training settings. "
