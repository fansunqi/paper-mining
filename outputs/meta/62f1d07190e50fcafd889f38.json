  "abstract": "  Probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) is a practical means to achieve a shaping gain in optical fiber communication. However, PAS and shaping in general also affect the signal-dependent generation of nonlinear interference. This provides an opportunity for nonlinearity mitigation through PAS, which is also referred to as a nonlinear shaping gain. In this paper, we introduce a linear lowpass filter model that relates transmitted symbol-energy sequences and nonlinear distortion experienced in an optical fiber channel. Based on this model, we conduct a nonlinearity analysis of PAS with respect to shaping blocklength and mapping strategy. Our model explains results and relationships found in literature and can be used as a design tool for PAS with improved nonlinearity tolerance. We use the model to introduce a new metric for PAS with sequence selection. We perform simulations of selection-based PAS with various amplitude shapers and mapping strategies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new metric in different optical fiber system scenarios. "
