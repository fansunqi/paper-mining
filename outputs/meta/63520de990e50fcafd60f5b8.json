  "abstract": "  We consider methods for obtaining local lower bounds on characteristics of quantum (correspondingly, classical) systems, i.e. lower bounds valid in the trace norm $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of a given state (correspondingly, probability distribution). The main attention is paid to infinite-dimensional systems. "
