  "title": "Multi Lane Detection",
  "abstract": "  Lane detection is a long-standing task and a basic module in autonomous driving. The task is to detect the lane of the current driving road, and provide relevant information such as the ID, direction, curvature, width, length, with visualization. Our work is based on CNN backbone DLA-34, along with Affinity Fields, aims to achieve robust detection of various lanes without assuming the number of lanes. Besides, we investigate novel decoding methods to achieve more efficient lane detection algorithm. "
