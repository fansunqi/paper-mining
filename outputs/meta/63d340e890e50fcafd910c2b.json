  "abstract": "  In this work, we present ARDIAS, a web-based application that aims to provide researchers with a full suite of discovery and collaboration tools. ARDIAS currently allows searching for authors and articles by name and gaining insights into the research topics of a particular researcher. With the aid of AI-based tools, ARDIAS aims to recommend potential collaborators and topics to researchers. In the near future, we aim to add tools that allow researchers to communicate with each other and start new projects. "
