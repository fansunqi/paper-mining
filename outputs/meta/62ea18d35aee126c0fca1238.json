  "title": "A Diamond Structure in the Transducer Hierarchy",
  "abstract": "  We answer an open question in the theory of transducer degrees initially posed in [1] on the existence of a diamond structure in the transducer hierarchy. Transducer degrees are the equivalence classes formed by word transformations which can be realized by a finite state transducer, which form an order based on which words can be transformed into other words. We provide a construction which proves the existence of a diamond structure, while also introducing a new function on streams which may be useful for proving more results about the transducer hierarchy.
