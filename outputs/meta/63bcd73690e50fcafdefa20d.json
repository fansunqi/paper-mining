  "abstract": "  Estimation of the parameters of a 2-dimensional sinusoidal model is a fundamental problem in digital signal processing. In this paper, we propose a robust least absolute deviation (LAD) estimators for parameter estimation. The proposed methodology provides a robust alternative to non-robust estimation techniques like the least squares estimators, in situations where outliers are present in the data or in the presence of heavy tailed noise. We study important asymptotic properties of the LAD estimators and establish the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the LAD estimators. We further illustrate the advantage of using LAD estimators over least squares estimators through extensive simulation studies. "
