  "title": "Automated design of pneumatic soft grippers through design-dependent\n  multi-material topology optimization",
  "abstract": "  Soft robotic grasping has rapidly spread through the academic robotics community in recent years and pushed into industrial applications. At the same time, multimaterial 3D printing has become widely available, enabling the monolithic manufacture of devices containing rigid and elastic sections. We propose a novel design technique that leverages both technologies and can automatically design bespoke soft robotic grippers for fruit-picking and similar applications. We demonstrate the novel topology optimisation formulation that generates multi-material soft grippers, can solve internal and external pressure boundaries, and investigate methods to produce air-tight designs. Compared to existing methods, it vastly expands the searchable design space while increasing simulation accuracy. "
