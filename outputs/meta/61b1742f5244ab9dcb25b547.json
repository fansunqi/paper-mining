  "title": "On anti-stochastic properties of unlabeled graphs",
  "abstract": "  We study vulnerability of a uniformly distributed random graph to an attack by an adversary who aims for a global change of the distribution while being able to make only a local change in the graph. We call a graph property $A$ anti-stochastic if the probability that a random graph $G$ satisfies $A$ is small but, with high probability, there is a small perturbation transforming $G$ into a graph satisfying $A$. While for labeled graphs such properties are easy to obtain from binary covering codes, the existence of anti-stochastic properties for unlabeled graphs is not so evident. If an admissible perturbation is either the addition or the deletion of one edge, we exhibit an anti-stochastic property that is satisfied by a random unlabeled graph of order $n$ with probability $(2+o(1))/n^2$, which is as small as possible. We also express another anti-stochastic property in terms of the degree sequence of a graph. This property has probability $(2+o(1))/(n\\ln n)$, which is optimal up to factor of 2. "
