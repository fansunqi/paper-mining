  "abstract": "  Let $P$ be a convex polyhedron and $Q$ be a convex polygon with $n$ vertices in total in three-dimensional space. We present a deterministic algorithm that finds a translation vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ maximizing the overlap area $|P \\cap (Q + v)|$ in $O(n \\log^2 n)$ time. We then apply our algorithm to solve two related problems. We give an $O(n \\log^3 n)$ time algorithm that finds the maximum overlap area of three convex polygons with $n$ vertices in total. We also give an $O(n \\log^2 n)$ time algorithm that minimizes the symmetric difference of two convex polygons under scaling and translation. "
