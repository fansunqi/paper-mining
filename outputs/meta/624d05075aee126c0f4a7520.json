  "abstract": "  In recent years a new class of symmetric-key primitives over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ that are essential to Multi-Party Computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs based protocols have emerged. Towards improving the efficiency of such primitives, a number of new block ciphers and hash functions over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ were proposed. These new primitives also showed that following alternative design strategies to the classical Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) and Feistel Networks leads to more efficient cipher and hash function designs over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ specifically for large odd primes $p$.   In view of these efforts, in this work we build an \\emph{algebraic framework} that allows the systematic exploration of viable and efficient design strategies for constructing symmetric-key (iterative) permutations over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. We first identify iterative polynomial dynamical systems over finite fields as the central building block of almost all block cipher design strategies. We propose a generalized triangular polynomial dynamical system (GTDS), and based on the GTDS we provide a generic definition of an iterative (keyed) permutation over $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$.   Our GTDS-based generic definition is able to describe the three most well-known design strategies, namely SPNs, Feistel networks and Lai--Massey. Consequently, the block ciphers that are constructed following these design strategies can also be instantiated from our generic definition. Moreover, we find that the recently proposed \\texttt{Griffin} design, which neither follows the Feistel nor the SPN design, can be described using the generic GTDS-based definition. We also show that a new generalized Lai--Massey construction can be instantiated from the GTDS-based definition.   We further provide generic analysis of the GTDS including an upper bound on the differential uniformity and the correlation. "
