  "title": "Two-Timescale Joint Precoding Design and RIS Optimization for User\n  Tracking in Near-Field MIMO Systems",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel framework that aims to jointly design the reflection coefficients of multiple RISs and the precoding strategy of a single BS to optimize the self-tracking of the position and the velocity of a single multi-antenna UE that moves either in the far- or near-field region. Differently from the literature, and to keep the overall complexity affordable, we assume that RIS optimization is performed less frequently than localization and precoding adaptation. The proposed procedure leads to minimize the inverse of the received power in the UE position uncertainty area between two subsequent optimization steps.   The optimal RIS and precoder strategy are compared with the classical beam-focusing strategy and with a scheme that maximizes the communication rate. It is shown that if the RISs are optimized for communications, their configuration is suboptimal when used for tracking purposes.   Numerical results show that in typical indoor environments with only one BS and a few RISs operating on millimeter waves, high location accuracy in the range of less than half a meter can be achieved.
