  "title": "Dual Representation Learning for One-Step Clustering of Multi-View Data",
  "abstract": "  Multi-view data are commonly encountered in data mining applications. Effective extraction of information from multi-view data requires specific design of clustering methods to cater for data with multiple views, which is non-trivial and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel one-step multi-view clustering method by exploiting the dual representation of both the common and specific information of different views. The motivation originates from the rationale that multi-view data contain not only the consistent knowledge between views but also the unique knowledge of each view. Meanwhile, to make the representation learning more specific to the clustering task, a one-step learning framework is proposed to integrate representation learning and clustering partition as a whole. With this framework, the representation learning and clustering partition mutually benefit each other, which effectively improve the clustering performance. Results from extensive experiments conducted on benchmark multi-view datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. "
