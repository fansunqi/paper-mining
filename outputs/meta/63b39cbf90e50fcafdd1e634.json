  "title": "IMC: A Classification of Identity Management Approaches",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents a comprehensive classification of identity management approaches. The classification makes use of three axes: topology, type of user, and type of environment. The analysis of existing approaches using the resulting identity management cube (IMC) highlights the trade-off between user control and trust in attributes. A comparative analysis of IMC and established models identifies missing links between the approaches. The IMC is extended by a morphology of identity management, describing characteristics of cooperation. The morphology is then mapped to the life cycle of users and identity management in a further step. These classifications are practically underlined with current approaches. Both methods combined provide a comprehensive characterization of identity management approaches. The methods help to choose suited approaches and implement needed tools. "
