  "abstract": "  The proliferation of non-cooperative resident space objects (RSOs) in orbit has spurred the demand for active space debris removal, on-orbit servicing (OOS), classification, and functionality identification of these RSOs. Recent advances in computer vision have enabled high-definition 3D modeling of objects based on a set of 2D images captured from different viewing angles. This work adapts Instant NeRF and D-NeRF, variations of the neural radiance field (NeRF) algorithm to the problem of mapping RSOs in orbit for the purposes of functionality identification and assisting with OOS. The algorithms are evaluated for 3D reconstruction quality and hardware requirements using datasets of images of a spacecraft mock-up taken under two different lighting and motion conditions at the Orbital Robotic Interaction, On-Orbit Servicing and Navigation (ORION) Laboratory at Florida Institute of Technology. Instant NeRF is shown to learn high-fidelity 3D models with a computational cost that could feasibly be trained on on-board computers. "
