  "title": "An Online Framework to Interact and Efficiently Compute Linear Layouts\n  of Graphs",
  "abstract": "  We present a prototype online system to automate the procedure of computing different types of linear layouts of graphs under different user-specific constraints. Currently, four different types of linear layouts are supported: stack, queue, rique and deque, as well as, any mixture of them.   The system consists of two main components; the client and the server sides. The client side is built upon an easy-to-use editor, which supports basic interaction with graphs, enriched with several additional features to allow the user to define and further constraint the linear layout to be computed. The server side, which is available to multiple clients through a well-documented API, is responsible for the actual computation of the linear layout. Its algorithmic core is an extension of a SAT formulation that is known to be robust enough to solve non-trivial instances in reasonable amount of time. "
