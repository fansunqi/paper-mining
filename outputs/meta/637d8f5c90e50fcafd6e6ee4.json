  "abstract": "  The camouflaged object detection (COD) task aims to identify and segment objects that blend into the background due to their similar color or texture. Despite the inherent difficulties of the task, COD has gained considerable attention in several fields, such as medicine, life-saving, and anti-military fields. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called the Deformable Point Sampling network (DPS-Net) to address the challenges associated with COD. The proposed DPS-Net utilizes a Deformable Point Sampling transformer (DPS transformer) that can effectively capture sparse local boundary information of significant object boundaries in COD using a deformable point sampling method. Moreover, the DPS transformer demonstrates robust COD performance by extracting contextual features for target object localization through integrating rough global positional information of objects with boundary local information. We evaluate our method on three prominent datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments. "
