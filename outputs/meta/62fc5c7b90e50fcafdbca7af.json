  "abstract": "  To achieve reliable and efficient transmissions in free-space optical (FSO) communication, this paper designs a new protograph low-density parity-check (PLDPC) coded generalized spatial multipulse position modulation (GSMPPM) system over weak turbulence channels. Specifically, we investigate the PLDPC code, generalized space shift keying (GSSK) modulation, and MPPM constellation. First, we propose a type of novel GSMPPM constellations that intelligently integrates the GSSK into MPPM, referred to as asymmetric dual-mode (ADM) constellations, so as to improve the performance of the PLDPC-coded GSMPPM system. Furthermore, exploiting a protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm, we construct a type of improved PLDPC code, referred to as I-PLDPC code, which outperforms the existing PLDPC codes over weak turbulence channels. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed ADM constellations and the proposed I-PLDPC code can obtain noticeable performance gains over their counterparts. Therefore, the proposed PLDPC-coded GSMPPM system with ADM constellations is competent to satisfy the high-reliability requirement for FSO applications. "
