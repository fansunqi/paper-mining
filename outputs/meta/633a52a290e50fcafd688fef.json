  "title": "The Replicator Dynamic, Chain Components and the Response Graph",
  "abstract": "  In this paper we examine the relationship between the flow of the replicator dynamic, the continuum limit of Multiplicative Weights Update, and a game's response graph. We settle an open problem establishing that under the replicator, sink chain components -- a topological notion of long-run outcome of a dynamical system -- always exist and are approximated by the sink connected components of the game's response graph. More specifically, each sink chain component contains a sink connected component of the response graph, as well as all mixed strategy profiles whose support consists of pure profiles in the same connected component, a set we call the content of the connected component. As a corollary, all profiles are chain recurrent in games with strongly connected response graphs. In any two-player game sharing a response graph with a zero-sum game, the sink chain component is unique. In two-player zero-sum and potential games the sink chain components and sink connected components are in a one-to-one correspondence, and we conjecture that this holds in all games. "
