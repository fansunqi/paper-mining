  "abstract": "  Application for semantic segmentation models in areas such as autonomous vehicles and human computer interaction require real-time predictive capabilities. The challenges of addressing real-time application is amplified by the need to operate on resource constrained hardware. Whilst development of real-time methods for these platforms has increased, these models are unable to sufficiently reason about uncertainty present. This paper addresses this by combining deep feature extraction from pre-trained models with Bayesian regression and moment propagation for uncertainty aware predictions. We demonstrate how the proposed method can yield meaningful uncertainty on embedded hardware in real-time whilst maintaining predictive performance. "
