  "title": "A Mathematical Programming Approach to Optimal Classification Forests",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce Optimal Classification Forests, a new family of classifiers that takes advantage of an optimal ensemble of decision trees to derive accurate and interpretable classifiers. We propose a novel mathematical optimization-based methodology in which a given number of trees are simultaneously constructed, each of them providing a predicted class for the observations in the feature space. The classification rule is derived by assigning to each observation its most frequently predicted class among the trees in the forest. We provide a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the problem. We report the results of our computational experiments, from which we conclude that our proposed method has equal or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art tree-based classification methods. More importantly, it achieves high prediction accuracy with, for example, orders of magnitude fewer trees than random forests. We also present three real-world case studies showing that our methodology has very interesting implications in terms of interpretability. "
