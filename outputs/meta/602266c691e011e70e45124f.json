  "title": "Deep Learning Based Walking Tasks Classification in Older Adults using\n  fNIRS",
  "abstract": "  Decline in gait features is common in older adults and an indicator of increased risk of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Under dual task walking (DTW) conditions, further degradation in the performance of both the gait and the secondary cognitive task were found in older adults which were significantly correlated to falls history. Cortical control of gait, specifically in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) as measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during DTW in older adults has recently been studied. However, the automatic classification of differences in cognitive activations under single and dual task gait conditions has not been extensively studied yet. In this paper, we formulate this as a classification task and leverage deep learning to perform automatic classification of STW, DTW and single cognitive task (STA). We conduct analysis on the data samples which reveals the characteristics on the difference between HbO2 and Hb values that are subsequently used as additional features. We perform feature engineering to formulate the fNIRS features as a 3-channel image and apply various image processing techniques for data augmentation to enhance the performance of deep learning models. Experimental results show that pre-trained deep learning models that are fine-tuned using the collected fNIRS dataset together with gender and cognitive status information can achieve around 81\\% classification accuracy which is about 10\\% higher than the traditional machine learning algorithms. We further perform an ablation study to identify rankings of features such as the fNIRS levels and/or voxel locations on the contribution of the classification task. "
