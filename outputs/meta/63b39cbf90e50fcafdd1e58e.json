  "title": "RiskProp: Account Risk Rating on Ethereum via De-anonymous Score and\n  Network Propagation",
  "abstract": "  As one of the most popular blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts, Ethereum has caught the interest of both investors and criminals. Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of existing models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum. Through case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that the risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors and protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method.
