  "title": "Inpainting borehole images using Generative Adversarial Networks",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach for gap filling in borehole images created by wireline microresistivity imaging tools. The proposed method utilizes a generator, global discriminator, and local discriminator to inpaint the missing regions of the image. The generator is based on an auto-encoder architecture with skip-connections, and the loss function used is the Wasserstein GAN loss. Our experiments on a dataset of borehole images demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively deal with large-scale missing pixels and generate realistic completion results. This approach can improve the quantitative evaluation of reservoirs and provide an essential basis for interpreting geological phenomena and reservoir parameters. "
