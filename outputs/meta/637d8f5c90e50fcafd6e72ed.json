  "title": "Finding Almost Tight Witness Trees",
  "abstract": "  This paper addresses a graph optimization problem, called the Witness Tree problem, which seeks a spanning tree of a graph minimizing a certain non-linear objective function. This problem is of interest because it plays a crucial role in the analysis of the best approximation algorithms for two fundamental network design problems: Steiner Tree and Node-Tree Augmentation. We will show how a wiser choice of witness trees leads to an improved approximation for Node-Tree Augmentation, and for Steiner Tree in special classes of graphs. "
