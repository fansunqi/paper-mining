  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present new measurement results to model large-scale path loss, angular spread and channel sparsity at the sub-THz (141-145 GHz) band, for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Extensive measurement campaigns have been carried out, taking into account both line-of-sight (LoS) and non line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation. For all considered propagation scenarios, omni-directional and directional path loss models have been developed, based on the so-called close-in (CI) free-space reference distance model. Moreover, path loss modeling has been applied for the 2nd and 3rd strongest multipath components (MPCs), based on which path loss exponent and large-scale shadow fading estimates have been derived. A power angular spread analysis is further presented, using up to the 3rd strongest MPC. Finally, results on the sparsity of the wireless channel have also been presented by employing the so-called Gini index. "
