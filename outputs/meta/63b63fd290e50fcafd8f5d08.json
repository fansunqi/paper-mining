  "title": "Equalization of a 10 Gbps IMDD signal by a small silicon photonics time\n  delayed neural network",
  "abstract": "  A small 4-channels time-delayed complex perceptron is used as a silicon photonics neural network (NN) device to compensate for chromatic dispersion in optical fiber links. The NN device is experimentally tested with non-return-to-zero optical signals at 10 Gbps after propagation through up to 125 km optical fiber link. During the learning phase, a separation-loss function is optimized in order to maximally separate the transmitted levels of 0s from the 1s, which implies an optimization of the bit-error-rate. Testing of the NN device shows that the excess losses introduced by the NN device are compensated by the gain in transmitted signal equalization for a link longer than 100 km. The measured data are reproduced by a model which accounts for the optical link and the neural network device. This allows simulating the network performances for higher data rates, where the device shows improvement with respect to the benchmark both in terms of performance as well as ease of use. "
