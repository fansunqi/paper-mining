  "abstract": "  The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection graph (ABCD) is a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs with similar properties as the well-known LFR one, and its main parameter $\\xi$ can be tuned to mimic its counterpart in the LFR model, the mixing parameter $\\mu$. In this paper, we extend the ABCD model to include potential outliers. We perform some exploratory experiments on both the new ABCD+o model as well as a real-world network to show that outliers possess some desired, distinguishable properties. "
