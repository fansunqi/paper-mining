  "abstract": "  The importance of understanding and correcting algorithmic bias in machine learning (ML) has led to an increase in research on fairness in ML, which typically assumes that the underlying data is independent and identically distributed (IID). However, in reality, data is often represented using non-IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units. To address bias in ML systems, it is crucial to bridge the gap between the traditional fairness literature designed for IID data and the ubiquity of non-IID graph data. In this survey, we review such recent advance in fairness amidst non-IID graph data and identify datasets and evaluation metrics available for future research. We also point out the limitations of existing work as well as promising future directions. "
