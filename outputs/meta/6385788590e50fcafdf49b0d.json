  "title": "Information Measures for Entropy and Symmetry",
  "abstract": "  Entropy and information can be considered dual: entropy is a measure of the subspace defined by the information constraining the given ambient space. Negative entropies, arising in na\\\"ive extensions of the definition of entropy from discrete to continuous settings, are byproducts of the use of probabilities, which only work in the discrete case by a fortunate coincidence. We introduce the notions of sup-normalization and information measures, which allow for the appropriate generalization of the definition of entropy that keeps with the interpretation of entropy as a subspace volume. Applying this in the context of topological groups and Haar measures, we elucidate the relationship between entropy, symmetry, and uniformity. "
