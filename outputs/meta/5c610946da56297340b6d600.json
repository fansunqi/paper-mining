  "title": "Semantics for a Logic of Presuppositions",
  "abstract": "  In 1952 P. F. Strawson proposed a logic of presuppositions. It is an interpretation of Aristotelian logic, i.e. of the logic of the traditional syllogism. In 1981 Richard Diaz published a monograph in which he presented truth-relevant logic. This paper shows that truth-relevant logic is but a propositional version of the logic of presuppositions. A semantics of the logic of presuppositions is developed using truth-relevant logic. The semantics is then further extended to polyadic logic and some consequences discussed. "
