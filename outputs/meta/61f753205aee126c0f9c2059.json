  "abstract": "  We develop a novel graph-based trainable framework to maximize the weighted sum energy efficiency (WSEE) for power allocation in wireless communication networks. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, the proposed method consists of modular structures inspired by a classical iterative suboptimal approach and enhanced with learnable components. More precisely, we propose a deep unfolding of the successive concave approximation (SCA) method. In our unfolded SCA (USCA) framework, the originally preset parameters are now learnable via graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) that directly exploit multi-user channel state information as the underlying graph adjacency matrix. We show the permutation equivariance of the proposed architecture, which is a desirable property for models applied to wireless network data. The USCA framework is trained through a stochastic gradient descent approach using a progressive training strategy. The unsupervised loss is carefully devised to feature the monotonic property of the objective under maximum power constraints. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate its generalizability across different network topologies of varying size, density, and channel distribution. Thorough comparisons illustrate the improved performance and robustness of USCA over state-of-the-art benchmarks. "
