  "abstract": "  Image retrieval after propagation through multi-mode fibers is gaining attention due to their capacity to confine light and efficiently transport it over distances in a compact system. Here, we propose a generally applicable information-theoretic framework to transmit maximal-entropy (data) images and maximize the information transmission over sub-meter distances, a crucial capability that allows optical storage applications to scale and address different parts of storage media. To this end, we use millimeter-sized square optical waveguides to image a megapixel 8-bit spatial-light modulator. Data is thus represented as a 2D array of 8-bit values (symbols). Transmitting 100000s of symbols requires innovation beyond transmission matrix approaches. Deep neural networks have been recently utilized to retrieve images, but have been limited to small (thousands of symbols) and natural looking (low entropy) images. We maximize information transmission by combining a bandwidth-optimized homodyne detector with a differentiable hybrid neural-network consisting of a digital twin of the experiment setup and a U-Net. For the digital twin, we implement and compare a differentiable mode-based twin with a differentiable ray-based twin. Importantly, the latter can adapt to manufacturing-related setup imperfections during training which we show to be crucial. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end to recover digital input images while maximizing the achievable information page size based on a differentiable mutual-information estimator. We demonstrate retrieval of 66 kB at maximum with 1.7 bit per symbol on average with a range of 0.3 - 3.4 bit. "
