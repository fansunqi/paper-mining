  "abstract": "  Due to the heavy burden on medical institutes and computer-aided image diagnostics (CAD) have been gaining importance in diagnostic medicine to aid the medical staff to attain better service for the patients. Breast cancer is a fatal disease that can be treated successfully if it is detected early. Quantum neural network (QNN) has been introduced by many researchers around the world and presented recently by research corporations such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM. In this paper, we are trying to answer the question of: whether can the QNN be an effective method for mass-scale early breast cancer detection. This paper is dedicated to drawing a baseline for examining QNN, and the results showed a promising opportunity to use it for mass-scale screening using a fully functional quantum computer. "
