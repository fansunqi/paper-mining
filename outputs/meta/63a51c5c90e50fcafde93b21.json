  "abstract": "  Information asymmetry in games enables players with the information advantage to manipulate others' beliefs by strategically revealing information to other players. This work considers a double-sided information asymmetry in a Bayesian Stackelberg game, where the leader's realized action, sampled from the mixed strategy commitment, is hidden from the follower. In contrast, the follower holds private information about his payoff. Given asymmetric information on both sides, an important question arises: \\emph{Does the leader's information advantage outweigh the follower's?} We answer this question affirmatively in this work, where we demonstrate that by adequately designing a signaling device that reveals partial information regarding the leader's realized action to the follower, the leader can achieve a higher expected utility than that without signaling. Moreover, unlike previous works on the Bayesian Stackelberg game where mathematical programming tools are utilized, we interpret the leader's commitment as a probability measure over the belief space. Such a probabilistic language greatly simplifies the analysis and allows an indirect signaling scheme, leading to a geometric characterization of the equilibrium under the proposed game model. "
