  "abstract": "  Generative models, such as the method of normalizing flows, have been suggested as alternatives to the standard algorithms for generating lattice gauge field configurations. Studies with the method of normalizing flows demonstrate the proof of principle for simple models in two dimensions. However, further studies indicate that the training cost can be, in general, very high for large lattices. The poor scaling traits of current models indicate that moderate-size networks cannot efficiently handle the inherently multi-scale aspects of the problem, especially around critical points. We explore current models with limited acceptance rates for large lattices and examine new architectures inspired by effective field theories to improve scaling traits. We also discuss alternative ways of handling poor acceptance rates for large lattices. "
