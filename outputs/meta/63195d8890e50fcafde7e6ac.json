  "abstract": "  We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results establish that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth. "
