  "title": "On the Mathematics of Diffusion Models",
  "abstract": "  This paper gives direct derivations of the differential equations and likelihood formulas of diffusion models assuming only knowledge of Gaussian distributions. A VAE analysis derives both forward and backward stochastic differential equations (SDEs) as well as non-variational integral expressions for likelihood formulas. A score-matching analysis derives the reverse diffusion ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a family of reverse-diffusion SDEs parameterized by noise level. The paper presents the mathematics directly with attributions saved for a final section. "
