  "title": "Neural Shape Compiler: A Unified Framework for Transforming between\n  Text, Point Cloud, and Program",
  "abstract": "  3D shapes have complementary abstractions from low-level geometry to part-based hierarchies to languages, which convey different levels of information. This paper presents a unified framework to translate between pairs of shape abstractions: $\\textit{Text}$ $\\Longleftrightarrow$ $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longleftrightarrow$ $\\textit{Program}$. We propose $\\textbf{Neural Shape Compiler}$ to model the abstraction transformation as a conditional generation process. It converts 3D shapes of three abstract types into unified discrete shape code, transforms each shape code into code of other abstract types through the proposed $\\textit{ShapeCode Transformer}$, and decodes them to output the target shape abstraction. Point Cloud code is obtained in a class-agnostic way by the proposed $\\textit{Point}$VQVAE. On Text2Shape, ShapeGlot, ABO, Genre, and Program Synthetic datasets, Neural Shape Compiler shows strengths in $\\textit{Text}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Point Cloud}$, $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Text}$, $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Program}$, and Point Cloud Completion tasks. Additionally, Neural Shape Compiler benefits from jointly training on all heterogeneous data and tasks. "
