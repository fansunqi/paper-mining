  "abstract": "  Leveraging machine learning techniques for Sepsis early detection and diagnosis has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, most existing methods require a large amount of labeled training data, which may not be available for a target hospital that deploys a new Sepsis detection system. More seriously, as treated patients are diversified between hospitals, directly applying a model trained on other hospitals may not achieve good performance for the target hospital. To address this issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised transfer learning framework based on optimal transport theory and self-paced ensemble for Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, which can efficiently transfer knowledge from the source hospital (with rich labeled data) to the target hospital (with scarce labeled data). Specifically, SPSSOT incorporates a new optimal transport-based semi-supervised domain adaptation component that can effectively exploit all the unlabeled data in the target hospital. Moreover, self-paced ensemble is adapted in SPSSOT to alleviate the class imbalance issue during transfer learning. In a nutshell, SPSSOT is an end-to-end transfer learning method that automatically selects suitable samples from two domains (hospitals) respectively and aligns their feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SPSSOT outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by improving 1-3% of AUC. "
