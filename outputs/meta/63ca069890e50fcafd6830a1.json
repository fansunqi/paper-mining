  "abstract": "  The development of vibration protection systems that ensure efficiency and safety in the operation of process equipment and pipelines is one of the main tasks of controlling the dynamic state of machines. One of the effective methods of vibration isolation of the equipment of these installations is the use of vibration mounts. Today, both passive and active methods of extinguishing are actively used. The combination of two methods of damping will ensure the stability and adaptability of vibration protection systems to the operating conditions of process equipment. The paper presents and investigates the device of a hybrid vibration support, including a magnetorheological spring, as an element of vibration damping. A distinctive feature of the vibration mount is an extended range of performance and reduced wear rate of the components. An analysis of the damping characteristics of a hybrid vibration support in passive and active modes of operation is presented. A simulation model of the vibration support under consideration has been developed in the MATLAB Simulink simulation environment using the PIB controller. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the use of vibration damping systems with a magnetorheological spring in conjunction with various technological equipment. "
