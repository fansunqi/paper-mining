  "abstract": "Evolutionary anti-coordination games on networks capture real-world strategic\nsituations such as traffic routing and market competition. In such games,\nagents maximize their utility by choosing actions that differ from their\nneighbors' actions. Two important problems concerning evolutionary games are\nthe existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and the convergence time of the\ndynamics. In this work, we study these two problems for anti-coordination games\nunder sequential and synchronous update schemes. For each update scheme, we\nexamine two decision modes based on whether an agent considers its own previous\naction (self essential ) or not (self non-essential ) in choosing its next\naction. Using a relationship between games and dynamical systems, we show that\nfor both update schemes, finding an NE can be done efficiently under the self\nnon-essential mode but is computationally intractable under the self essential\nmode. To cope with this hardness, we identify special cases for which an NE can\nbe obtained efficiently. For convergence time, we show that the best-response\ndynamics converges in a polynomial number of steps in the synchronous scheme\nfor both modes; for the sequential scheme, the convergence time is polynomial\nonly under the self non-essential mode. Through experiments, we empirically\nexamine the convergence time and the equilibria for both synthetic and\nreal-world networks."
