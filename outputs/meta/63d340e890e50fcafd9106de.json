  "abstract": "  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more popular as time passes, allowing to perform tasks that were difficult to do in the past. From predictions to customization, AI is being used in many areas, not being educational environments outside this situation. AI is being used in educational settings to customize contents or to provide personalized feedback to the students, among others. In this scenario, AI in programming teaching is something that still has to be explored, since in this area we usually find assessment tools that allow grading the students work, but we can not find many tools aimed towards providing feedback to the students in the process of creating their program. In this work we present an AI based intelligent tutor that answers students programming questions. The tool has been tested by university students at the URJC along a whole course. Even if the tool is still in its preliminary phase, it helped the students with their questions, providing accurate answers and examples. The students were able to use the intelligent tutor easily and they thought that it could be a useful tool to use in other courses. "
