  "abstract": "  Machine learning enables the development of new, supplemental, and empowering tools that can either expand existing technologies or invent new ones. In education, space exists for a tool that supports generic student course review formats to organize and recapitulate students' views on the pedagogical practices to which they are exposed. Often, student opinions are gathered with a general comment section that solicits their feelings towards their courses without polling specifics about course contents. Herein, we show a novel approach to summarizing and organizing students' opinions via analyzing their sentiment towards a course as a function of the language/vocabulary used to convey their opinions about a class and its contents. This analysis is derived from their responses to a general comment section encountered at the end of post-course review surveys. This analysis, accomplished with Python, LaTeX, and Google's Natural Language API, allows for the conversion of unstructured text data into both general and topic-specific sub-reports that convey students' views in a unique, novel way.
