  "title": "Hand Gesture Recognition through Reflected Infrared Light Wave Signals",
  "abstract": "  In this study, we present a wireless (non-contact) gesture recognition method using only incoherent light wave signals reflected from a human subject. In comparison to existing radar, light shadow, sound and camera-based sensing systems, this technology uses a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared LED) to send light towards the subject's hand performing gestures and the reflected light is collected by a light sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light wave sensing system recognizes different gestures from the variations of the received light intensity within a 20-35cm range. The hand gesture recognition results demonstrate up to 96% accuracy on average. The developed system can be utilized in numerous Human-computer Interaction (HCI) applications as a low-cost and non-contact gesture recognition technology. "
