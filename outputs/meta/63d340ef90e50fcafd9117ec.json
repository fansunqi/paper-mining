  "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a novel and computationally efficient method to simultaneously achieve vertex embedding, community detection, and community size determination. By utilizing a normalized one-hot graph encoder and a new rank-based cluster size measure, the proposed graph encoder ensemble algorithm achieves excellent numerical performance throughout a variety of simulations and real data experiments.
