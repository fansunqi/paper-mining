  "abstract": "  Synthetic aperture radar tomographic imaging reconstructs the three-dimensional reflectivity of a scene from a set of coherent acquisitions performed in an interferometric configuration. In forest areas, a large number of elements backscatter the radar signal within each resolution cell. To reconstruct the vertical reflectivity profile, state-of-the-art techniques perform a regularized inversion implemented in the form of iterative minimization algorithms. We show that light-weight neural networks can be trained to perform the tomographic inversion with a single feed-forward pass, leading to fast reconstructions that could better scale to the amount of data provided by the future BIOMASS mission. We train our encoder-decoder network using simulated data and validate our technique on real L-band and P-band data. "
