  "title": "Convolutional Graph-Tensor Net for Graph Data Completion",
  "abstract": "  Graph data completion is a fundamentally important issue as data generally has a graph structure, e.g., social networks, recommendation systems, and the Internet of Things. We consider a graph where each node has a data matrix, represented as a \\textit{graph-tensor} by stacking the data matrices in the third dimension. In this paper, we propose a \\textit{Convolutional Graph-Tensor Net} (\\textit{Conv GT-Net}) for the graph data completion problem, which uses deep neural networks to learn the general transform of graph-tensors. The experimental results on the ego-Facebook data sets show that the proposed \\textit{Conv GT-Net} achieves significant improvements on both completion accuracy (50\\% higher) and completion speed (3.6x $\\sim$ 8.1x faster) over the existing algorithms.
