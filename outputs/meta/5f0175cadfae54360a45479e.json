  "title": "Comparative Study of Virtual Machines and Containers for DevOps\n  Developers",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents a comparative study of virtual machines (VMs) and containers for DevOps developers. The study explores the benefits and drawbacks of each technology in terms of their functionality, performance, security, and resource utilization. The paper examines the underlying architecture of VMs and containers, and how they differ from each other. The study includes a series of experiments that compare the performance and resource utilization of VMs and containers in different scenarios. The experiments evaluate factors such as startup time, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency, scalability, and administrative overhead. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for DevOps developers on which technology to choose based on their specific requirements and use cases. Overall, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of VMs and containers, helping developers to make informed decisions when choosing between them. "
