  "abstract": "  In this article, we introduce parallel-in-time methods for state and parameter estimation in general nonlinear non-Gaussian state-space models using the statistical linear regression and the iterated statistical posterior linearization paradigms. We also reformulate the proposed methods in a square-root form, resulting in improved numerical stability while preserving the parallelization capabilities. We then leverage the fixed-point structure of our methods to perform likelihood-based parameter estimation in logarithmic time with respect to the number of observations. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the methodology with numerical experiments run on a graphics processing unit (GPU). "
