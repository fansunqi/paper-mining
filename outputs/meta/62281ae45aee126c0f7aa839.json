  "abstract": "  States of open quantum systems usually decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that a finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroup with detailed balance induces exponential decay toward a subspace of invariant or fully decayed states. In contrast, we analyze continuous processes that combine coherent and stochastic processes, precluding detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to analogous decay bounds for these processes and prove conditions under which they fail. Second, we prove that the relationship between the strength of local noise applied to part of a larger system and overall decay of the whole is non-monotonic. Noise can suppress interactions that would spread it. Faster decay of a subsystem may thereby slow overall decay. We observe this interplay numerically and its discrete analog experimentally on IBM Q systems. Our main results explain and generalize the phenomenon theoretically. Finally, we observe that in spite of its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional semigroups at finite time. "
