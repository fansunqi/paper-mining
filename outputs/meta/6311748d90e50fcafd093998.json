  "abstract": "  In 2020 the Australia New Zealand Standard Research Classification Fields of Research Codes (ANZSRC FoR codes) were updated by their owners. This has led the sector to need to update their systems of reference and has caused suppliers working in the research information sphere to need to update both systems and data. This paper describes the approach developed by Digital Science's Dimensions team to the creation of an improved machine learning training set, and the mapping of that set from FoR 2008 codes to FoR 2020 codes so that Dimensions classification approach for the ANZSRC codes could be improved and updated.
