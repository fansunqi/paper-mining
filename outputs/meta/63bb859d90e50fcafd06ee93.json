  "abstract": "  Social contagion is a ubiquitous and fundamental process that drives social changes. Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes and biases, the integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social contagion remains as an open challenge. In particular, studies on social phenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex, rather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical evidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion dynamics -- from simple to complex -- simultaneously. Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs as a unifying framework, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion -- resistance -- can come about from cognitive mechanisms. Our model may offer a unifying framework to study both simple and complex contagion dynamics in social systems. "
