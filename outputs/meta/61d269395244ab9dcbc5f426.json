  "title": "Subresultant of several univariate polynomials",
  "abstract": "  Subresultant of two univariate polynomials is a fundamental object in computational algebra and geometry with many applications (for instance, parametric GCD and parametric multiplicity of roots). In this paper, we generalize the theory of subresultants of two polynomials to arbitrary number of polynomials, resulting in multi-polynomial subresultants. Specifically,   1. we propose a definition of multi-polynomial subresultants, which is an expression in terms of roots;   2. we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed definition via the following two fundamental applications:   - parametric GCD of multi-polynomials, and   - parametric multiplicity of roots of a polynomial;   3. we provide several expressions for the multi-polynomials subresultants in terms of coefficients, for computation.
