  "title": "A Finite-Particle Convergence Rate for Stein Variational Gradient\n  Descent",
  "abstract": "  We provide a first finite-particle convergence rate for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). Specifically, whenever the target distribution is sub-Gaussian with a Lipschitz score, SVGD with n particles and an appropriate step size sequence drives the kernel Stein discrepancy to zero at an order 1/sqrt(log log n) rate. We suspect that the dependence on n can be improved, and we hope that our explicit, non-asymptotic proof strategy will serve as a template for future refinements. "
