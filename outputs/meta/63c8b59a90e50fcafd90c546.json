  "title": "MultiCalib4DEB: A toolbox exploiting multimodal optimisation in Dynamic\n  Energy Budget parameters calibration",
  "abstract": "  Calibration is a crucial step for the validation of computational models and a challenging task to accomplish. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory has experienced an exponential rise in the number of published papers, which in large part has been made possible by the DEBtool toolbox. Multimodal evolutionary optimisation could provide DEBtool with new capabilities, particularly relevant on the provisioning of equally optimal and diverse solutions. In this paper we present MultiCalib4DEB, a MATLAB toolbox directly integrated into the existing DEBtool toolbox, which uses multimodal evolutionary optimisation algorithms to find multiple global and local optimal and diverse calibration solutions for DEB models. MultiCalib4DEB adds powerful calibration mechanisms, statistical analysis, and visualisation methods to the DEBtool toolbox and provides a wide range of outputs, different calibration alternatives, and specific tools to strengthen the DEBtool calibration module and to aid DEBtool users to evaluate the performance of the calibration results.
