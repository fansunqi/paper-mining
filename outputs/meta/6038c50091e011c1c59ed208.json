  "title": "Cloud Broker: A Systematic Mapping Study",
  "abstract": "  In a cloud environment, a cloud broker is an important entity that works as an independent middleware between cloud customers and providers to address issues and conduct negotiations related to satisfying both customer preferences and service provider profits. In recent years, researchers have published many articles which directly or indirectly address this research area. A systematic method is vital for extracting all search spaces (journals, conferences, and workshops) and primary studies (articles) conducted in the cloud broker field and then selecting some of the highest quality studies. The proposed systematic review includes a comprehensive three-tier search strategy (manual search, backward snowballing, and database search). The detailed explanation of the reviewing process is inserted in Appendix A. In the search methodology, qualitative criteria have been defined to select studies with the highest quality and the most relevance among all search spaces. In the present study, out of 1,928 extracted search spaces, 171 search spaces have been selected based on the defined quality criteria. Then, 1,298 articles have been extracted from these 171 selected search spaces. As a result, 496 high-quality papers have been selected among the mentioned papers. The chosen papers were published in prestigious journals, conferences, and workshops from 2009 through 2019. In the current Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), eight research questions have been designed for the purpose of identifying information that is significant to the cloud broker field, such as the most critical and debated topics, existing trends and issues, active researchers and countries, commonly used techniques in building cloud brokers, evaluation methods, the amount of research conducted by year and the place of publication, and the most important active search spaces.
