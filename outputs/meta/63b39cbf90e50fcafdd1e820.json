  "title": "RIS-Assisted Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Low-Complexity\n  Greedy Detection",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication scheme which uses the concept of spatial modulation, namely RIS-assisted receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-RQSM). In the proposed RIS-RQSM system, the information bits are conveyed via both the indices of the two selected receive antennas and the conventional in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulation. We propose a novel methodology to adjust the phase shifts of the RIS elements in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and at the same time to construct two separate PAM symbols at the selected receive antennas, as the in-phase and quadrature components of the desired IQ symbol. An energy-based greedy detector (GD) is implemented at the receiver to efficiently detect the received signal with minimal channel state information (CSI) via the use of an appropriately designed one-tap pre-equalizer. We also derive a closed-form upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSM system. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the ABEP in order to improve the performance of the system, which allows the GD to act as a near-optimal receiver. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the error rate performance of the system and to compare with that of a prominent benchmark scheme. The results verify the remarkable superiority of the proposed RIS-RQSM system over the benchmark scheme. "
