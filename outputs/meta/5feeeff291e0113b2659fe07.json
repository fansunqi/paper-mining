  "title": "A constructive method to minimize couple matchings",
  "abstract": "  This paper provides constructive procedures for the indeterminacy coupling between two marginal distributions, an alternative to independence coupling. It also introduces a drawing under indeterminacy into a mixture of three independent couplings. Leveraging on this decomposition it states that indeterminacy optimally reduces couple matchings, minimizing the expected number of equal couples drawn in a row. Besides it is seen that the Janson Vegelius coefficient is nothing but a deviation to indeterminacy and it is shown that it tends to 0 when the number of modalities increases. "
