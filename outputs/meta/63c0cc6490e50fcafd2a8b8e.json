  "abstract": "  Sample weighting is widely used in deep learning. A large number of weighting methods essentially utilize the learning difficulty of training samples to calculate their weights. In this study, this scheme is called difficulty-based weighting. Two important issues arise when explaining this scheme. First, a unified difficulty measure that can be theoretically guaranteed for training samples does not exist. The learning difficulties of the samples are determined by multiple factors including noise level, imbalance degree, margin, and uncertainty. Nevertheless, existing measures only consider a single factor or in part, but not in their entirety. Second, a comprehensive theoretical explanation is lacking with respect to demonstrating why difficulty-based weighting schemes are effective in deep learning. In this study, we theoretically prove that the generalization error of a sample can be used as a universal difficulty measure. Furthermore, we provide formal theoretical justifications on the role of difficulty-based weighting for deep learning, consequently revealing its positive influences on both the optimization dynamics and generalization performance of deep models, which is instructive to existing weighting schemes.
