  "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has considerable potential to improve irrigation\nscheduling in many cropping systems by applying adaptive amounts of water based\non various measurements over time. The goal is to discover an intelligent\ndecision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes\nsensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. Due to the technical\nnovelty, however, the research on the technique remains sparse and impractical.\nTo accelerate the progress, the paper proposes a principled framework and\nactionable procedure that allow researchers to formulate their own optimisation\nproblems and implement solution algorithms based on deep reinforcement\nlearning. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case\nstudy of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where\nprofits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state\nvariable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil\nwater for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative\nirrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate\nirrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day. The production system\nwas simulated at Goondiwindi using the APSIM-Wheat crop model. After training\nin the learning environment using 1981-2010 weather data, the learned decision\nrule was tested individually for each year of 2011-2020. The results were\ncompared against the benchmark profits obtained by a conventional rule common\nin the region. The discovered decision rule prescribed daily irrigation amounts\nthat uniformly improved on the conventional rule for all the testing years, and\nthe largest improvement reached 17\napplicable to a wide range of cropping systems with realistic optimisation\nproblems."
