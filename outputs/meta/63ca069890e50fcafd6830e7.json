  "abstract": "  Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is a flexible and scalable feedback control method applicable to a wide range of systems. While stability analysis of DMPC is quite well understood, there exist only limited implementation results for realistic applications involving distributed computation and networked communication. This article approaches formation control of mobile robots via a cooperative DMPC scheme. We discuss the implementation via decentralized optimization algorithms. To this end, we combine the alternating direction method of multipliers with decentralized sequential quadratic programming to solve the underlying optimal control problem in a decentralized fashion. Our approach only requires coupled subsystems to communicate and does not rely on a central coordinator. Our experimental results showcase the efficacy of DMPC for formation control and they demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the considered algorithms. "
