  "abstract": "  Unlike others, IoT-enabled technology has expanded its base in various sectors, including finance, healthcare, agriculture, energy, and so forth. Tens of thousands of applications and products have evolved in recent years, leading to a constant threat to global climate sustainability due to the underlying carbon emissions. Researchers have developed standalone methods/approaches that aimed to tackle carbon emission problems. However, an article that expresses a list of carbon-neutral solutions and their associated technological challenges is not available. This article explores the carbon emission problems of IoT-enabled applications; and, it categorizes the carbon neutrality methods. The exploratory analysis of different carbon-neutral approaches, presented in this article, can present novel ideas and answers to questions that hover over any carbon-conscious IoT-enabled application developers.
