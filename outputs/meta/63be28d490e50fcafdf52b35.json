  "title": "Disrupted Routines Anticipate Musical Exploration",
  "abstract": "  Prior research suggests that taste preferences relate to personality traits, values, shifts in mood, and immigration destination, but understanding everyday patterns of listening and the function music plays in life have remained elusive, despite speculations that musical nostalgia may compensate for local disruption. Using more than a hundred million streams of 4 million songs by tens of thousands of international listeners from a global music service catering to local tastes, here we show that breaches in personal routine are systematically associated with personal musical exploration. As people visited new cities and countries, their preferences diversified, converging towards their destinations. As people experienced COVID-19 lock-downs, and then again when they experienced reopenings, their preferences diversified further. "
