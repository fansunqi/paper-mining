  "title": "Symplectic self-orthogonal quasi-cyclic codes",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi-cyclic codes with index even to be symplectic self-orthogonal. Then, we propose a method for constructing symplectic self-orthogonal quasi-cyclic codes, which allows arbitrary polynomials that divide $ x^{n}-1$ to construct symplectic self-orthogonal codes. Finally, we construct many binary symplectic self-orthogonal codes with excellent parameters, corresponding to over a hundred record-breaking quantum codes, improving Grassl's table (bounds on the minimum distance of quantum codes. http://www.codetables.de).
