  "abstract": "  Given a hypercube $\\mathcal{Q}^{n} := \\{0,1\\}^{n}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$, the $k$-th layer $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}_{k}$ of $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}$ denotes the set of all points in $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}$ whose coordinates contain exactly $k$ many ones. For a fixed $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$, let $P \\in \\mathbb{R}\\left[x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}\\right]$ be a polynomial that has zeroes of multiplicity at least $t$ at all points of $\\mathcal{Q}^{n} \\setminus \\mathcal{Q}^{n}_{k}$, and $P$ has zeros of multiplicity exactly $t-1$ at all points of $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}_{k}$. In this short note, we show that $$deg(P) \\geq \\max\\left\\{ k, n-k\\right\\}+2t-2.$$Matching the above lower bound we give an explicit construction of a family of hyperplanes $H_{1}, \\dots, H_{m}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $m = \\max\\left\\{ k, n-k\\right\\}+2t-2$, such that every point of $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}_{k}$ will be covered exactly $t-1$ times, and every other point of $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}$ will be covered at least $t$ times. Note that putting $k = 0$ and $t=1$, we recover the much celebrated covering result of Alon and F\\\"uredi (European Journal of Combinatorics, 1993). Using the above family of hyperplanes we disprove a conjecture of Venkitesh (The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 2022) on exactly covering symmetric subsets of hypercube $\\mathcal{Q}^{n}$ with hyperplanes. To prove the above results we have introduced a new measure of complexity of a subset of the hypercube called index complexity which we believe will be of independent interest.   We also study a new interesting variant of the restricted sumset problem motivated by the ideas behind the proof of the above result. "
