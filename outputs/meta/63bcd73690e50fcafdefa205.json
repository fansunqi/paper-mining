  "abstract": "  Simplicial complexes are a popular tool used to model higher-order interactions between elements of complex social and biological systems. In this paper, we study some combinatorial aspects of a class of simplicial complexes created by a graph product, which is an extension of the pseudo-fractal scale-free web. We determine explicitly the independence number, the domination number, and the chromatic number. Moreover, we derive closed-form expressions for the number of acyclic orientations, the number of root-connected acyclic orientations, the number of spanning trees, as well as the number of perfect matchings for some particular cases.
