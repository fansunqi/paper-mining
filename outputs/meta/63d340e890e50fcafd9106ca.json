  "abstract": "  We investigate the effect of style and category similarity in multiple datasets used for object detection pretraining. We find that including an additional stage of object-detection pretraining can increase the detection performance considerably. While our experiments suggest that style similarities between pre-training and target datasets are less important than matching categories, further experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis. "
