  "abstract": "  As the internet penetration rate in Africa increases, so does the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Along with this growth in internet access is the risk of cyberattacks to vulnerable IoT devices mushrooming in the African cyberspace. One way to determine IoT vulnerabilities is to find open ports within Africa s cyberspace. Our research leverages Shodan search engine, a powerful tool for discovering IoT devices facing the public internet, to find open ports across Africa. We conduct an analysis of our findings, ranking countries from most to least vulnerable to cyberattack. We find that South Africa,Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria are the five countries most susceptible to cyberattack on the continent. Further, 69.8% of devices having one of the five most commonly open internet ports have had past documented vulnerabilities. Following our analysis, we conclude with policy recommendations for both the public and private sector. "
