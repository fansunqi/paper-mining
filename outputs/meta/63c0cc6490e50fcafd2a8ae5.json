  "title": "Hardness of Ruling Out Short Proofs of Kolmogorov Randomness",
  "abstract": "  A meta-complexity assumption, Feasible Chaitin Incompleteness (FCI), asserts the hardness of ruling out length $t$ proofs that string $x$ is Kolmogorov random (e.g. $x{\\in}R$), by analogy to Chaitin's result that proving $x{\\in}R$ is typically impossible. By assertion, efficiently ruling out short proofs requires, impossibly, ruling out any proof. FCI has strong implications: (i) randomly chosen $x$ typically yields tautologies hard with high probability for any given proof system, densely witnessing its nonoptimality; (ii) average-case impossibility of proving $x{\\in}R$ implies average-case hardness of proving tautologies and Feige's hypothesis; and (iii) a natural language is $\\textbf{NP}$-intermediate -- the sparse complement of \"$x{\\in}R$ lacks a length $t$ proof\" (where $R$'s complement is sparse) -- and has $\\textbf{P/poly}$ circuits despite not being in $\\textbf{P}$.   FCI and its variants powerfully assert: (i) noncomputability facts translate to hardness conjectures; (ii) numerous open complexity questions have the expected answers (e.g. non-collapse of $\\textbf{PH}$), so one overarching conjecture subsumes many questions; and (iii) an implicit mapping between certain unprovable and hard-to-prove sentences is an isomorphism.   Further research could relate FCI to other open questions and hardness hypotheses; consider whether $R$ frustrates conditional program logic, implying FCI; and consider whether an extended isomorphism maps any true unprovable sentence to hard-to-prove sentences.
