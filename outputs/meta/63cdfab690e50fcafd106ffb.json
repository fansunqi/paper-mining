  "title": "Verification of crossbar-based lattice through modeling technique",
  "abstract": "  The use of Nano crossbar-based switching lattice implementation of Boolean functions has been proposed as an alternative to traditional CMOS-based implementations in digital circuits. As Moore law is expected to come to an end soon, the use of crossbar-based switching lattice implementation may be a solution to meet the demands of future electronic designs. In recent years, various methods and tools have been proposed for implementing boolean functions with crossbar structures. In this work, a method for verifying crossbar-based lattice has been proposed and implemented. This kind of verification will be necessary for any design that utilizes this crossbar-based implementation of boolean logic. "
