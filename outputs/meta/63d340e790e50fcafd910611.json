  "title": "SONIA: an immersive customizable virtual reality system for the\n  education and exploration of brain networks",
  "abstract": "While mastery of neuroanatomy is important for the investigation of the\nbrain, there is an increasing interest in exploring the neural pathways to\nbetter understand the roles of neural circuitry in brain functions. To tackle\nthe limitations of traditional 2D-display-based neuronavigation software in\nintuitively visualizing complex 3D anatomies, several virtual reality (VR) and\naugmented reality (AR) solutions have been proposed to facilitate\nneuroanatomical education. However, with the increasing knowledge on brain\nconnectivity and the functioning of the sub-systems, there is still a lack of\nsimilar software solutions for the education and exploration of these topics,\nwhich demand more elaborate visualization and interaction strategies. To\naddress this gap, we designed the immerSive custOmizable Neuro learnIng plAform\n(SONIA), a novel user-friendly VR software system with a multi-scale\ninteraction paradigm that allows flexible customization of learning materials.\nWith both quantitative and qualitative evaluations through user studies, the\nproposed system is shown to have high usability, attractive visual design, and\ngood educational value. As the first immersive system that integrates\ncustomizable design and detailed narratives of the brain sub-systems for the\neducation of neuroanatomy and brain connectivity, SONIA showcases new potential\ndirections and provides valuable insights regarding medical learning and\nexploration in VR."
