  "title": "Fast Cross-Correlation for TDoA Estimation on Small Aperture Microphone\n  Arrays",
  "abstract": "  This paper introduces the Fast Cross-Correlation (FCC) method for Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) Estimation for pairs of microphones on a small aperture microphone array. FCC relies on low-rank decomposition and exploits symmetry in even and odd bases to speed up computation while preserving TDoA accuracy. FCC reduces the number of flops by a factor of 4.5 and the execution speed by factors between 3.5 and 8.3 on embedded hardware, compared to the state-of-the-art Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC) method that relies on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This improvement can provide portable microphone arrays with extended battery life and allow real-time processing on low-cost hardware. "
