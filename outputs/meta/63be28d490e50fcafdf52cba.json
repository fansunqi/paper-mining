  "title": "The use of new technologies to support Public Administration. Sentiment\n  analysis and the case of the app IO",
  "abstract": "  App IO is an app developed for the Italian PA. It is definitely useful for citizens to interact with the PA and to get services that were not digitized yet. Nevertheless, it was not perceived in a good way by the citizens and it has been criticized. As we wanted to find the root that caused all these bad reviews we scraped feedback from mobile app stores using custom-coded automated tools and - after that - we trained two machine learning models to perform both sentiment analysis and emotion detection to understand what caused the bad reviews.
