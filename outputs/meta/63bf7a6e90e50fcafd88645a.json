  "abstract": "  Given a set of disks on the plane, the goal of the problem studied in this paper is to choose a subset of these disks such that none of its members contains the centre of any other. Each disk not in this subset must be merged with one of its nearby disks that is, increasing the latter's radius. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. We also present polynomial-time algorithms for the special case in which the centres of all disks are on a line. "
