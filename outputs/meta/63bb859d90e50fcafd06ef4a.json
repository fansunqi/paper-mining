  "title": "D-Algebraic Functions",
  "abstract": "  Differentially-algebraic (D-algebraic) functions are solutions of polynomial equations in the function, its derivatives, and the independent variables. We revisit closure properties of these functions by providing constructive proofs. We present algorithms to compute algebraic differential equations for compositions and arithmetic manipulations of univariate D-algebraic functions and derive bounds for the order of the resulting differential equations. We apply our methods to examples in the sciences. "
