  "title": "Asymmetric Coded Caching for Multi-Antenna Location-Dependent Content\n  Delivery",
  "abstract": "  Efficient usage of in-device storage and computation capabilities are key solutions to support data-intensive applications such as immersive digital experiences. This paper proposes a location-dependent multi-antenna coded caching -based content delivery scheme tailored specifically for wireless immersive viewing applications. First, a novel memory allocation process incentivizes the content relevant to the identified wireless bottleneck areas. This enables a trade-off between local and global caching gains and results in unequal fractions of location-dependent multimedia content cached by each user. Then, a novel packet generation process is carried out during the subsequent delivery phase, given the asymmetric cache placement. During this phase, the number of packets transmitted to each user is the same, while the sizes of the packets are proportional to the corresponding location-dependent cache ratios. In this regard, each user is served with location-specific content using joint multicast beamforming and a multi-rate modulation scheme that simultaneously benefits from global caching and spatial multiplexing gains. Numerical experiments and mathematical analysis demonstrate significant performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art. "
