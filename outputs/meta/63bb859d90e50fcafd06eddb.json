  "title": "Giving life to robotic skins",
  "abstract": "  The skin of humanoid robots often lacks human tactility and the inherent self-repair capability of biological tissues. Recently, researchers have grown a living, self-healing skin on a robot finger by subsequent culturing of human dermal and epidermal cells. Here, we highlight the significance of this study alongside challenges toward developing biohybrid robots equipped with sensate and adaptive living robotic skins. "
