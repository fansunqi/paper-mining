  "title": "RAIST: Learning Risk Aware Traffic Interactions via Spatio-Temporal\n  Graph Convolutional Networks",
  "abstract": "  A key aspect of driving a road vehicle is to interact with other road users, assess their intentions and make risk-aware tactical decisions. An intuitive approach to enabling an intelligent automated driving system would be incorporating some aspects of human driving behavior. To this end, we propose a novel driving framework for egocentric views based on spatio-temporal traffic graphs. The traffic graphs not only model the spatial interactions amongst the road users, but also their individual intentions through temporally associated message passing. We leverage spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) to train the graph edges. These edges are formulated using parameterized functions of 3D positions and scene-aware appearance features of road agents. Along with tactical behavior prediction, it is crucial to evaluate the risk-assessing ability of the proposed framework. We claim that our framework learns risk-aware representations by improving on the task of risk object identification, especially in identifying objects with vulnerable interactions like pedestrians and cyclists.
