  "abstract": "  The focus of this study is on the spectrum sharing between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and co-located MIMO radar systems in multi-path environments. The major challenge is to suppress the mutual interference between the two systems while combining the useful multi-path components received at each system. We tackle this challenge by jointly designing the communication precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter. Specifically, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the radar receiver is maximized subject to constraints on the radar waveform, communication rate and transmit power. The multi-path propagation complicates the expressions of the radar SINR and communication rate, leading to a non-convex problem. To solve it, a sub-optimal algorithm based on the alternating maximization is used to optimize the precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter iteratively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. "
