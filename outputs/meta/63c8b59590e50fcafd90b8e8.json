  "abstract": "  Local-HDP (for Local Hierarchical Dirichlet Process) is a hierarchical Bayesian method that has recently been used for open-ended 3D object category recognition. This method has been proven to be efficient in real-time robotic applications. However, the method is not robust to a high degree of occlusion. We address this limitation in two steps. First, we propose a novel semantic 3D object-parts segmentation method that has the flexibility of Local-HDP. This method is shown to be suitable for open-ended scenarios where the number of 3D objects or object parts is not fixed and can grow over time. We show that the proposed method has a higher percentage of mean intersection over union, using a smaller number of learning instances. Second, we integrate this technique with a recently introduced argumentation-based online incremental learning method, thereby enabling the model to handle a high degree of occlusion. We show that the resulting model produces an explicit set of explanations for the 3D object category recognition task. "
