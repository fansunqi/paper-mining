  "title": "Mitigating Docker Security Issues",
  "abstract": "  Docker offers an ecosystem that offers a platform for application packaging, distributing, and managing within containers. However, the Docker platform has not yet matured. Presently, Docker is less secured than virtual machines (VM) and most of the other cloud technologies. The key to Dockers inadequate security protocols is container sharing of Linux kernel, which can lead to the risk of privileged escalations. This research will outline some significant security vulnerabilities at Docker and counter solutions to neutralize such attacks. There are a variety of security attacks like insider and outsider. This research will outline both types of attacks and their mitigations strategies. Taking some precautionary measures can save from massive disasters. This research will also present Docker secure deployment guidelines. These guidelines will suggest different configurations to deploy Docker containers in a more secure way. "
