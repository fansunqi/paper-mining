  "abstract": "  Graph processes that unfold in continuous time are of obvious theoretical and practical interest. Particularly useful are those whose long-term behavior converges to a graph distribution of known form. Here, we review some of the conditions for such convergence, and provide examples of novel and/or known processes that do so. These include subfamilies of the well-known stochastic actor oriented models, as well as continuum extensions of temporal and separable temporal exponential family random graph models. We also comment on some related threads in the broader work on network dynamics, which provide additional context for the continuous time case. "
