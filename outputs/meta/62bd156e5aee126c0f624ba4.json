  "abstract": "  A kernel-based quantum classifier is the most practical and influential quantum machine learning technique for the hyper-linear classification of complex data. We propose a Variational Quantum Approximate Support Vector Machine (VQASVM) algorithm that demonstrates empirical sub-quadratic run-time complexity with quantum operations feasible even in NISQ computers. We experimented our algorithm with toy example dataset on cloud-based NISQ machines as a proof of concept. We also numerically investigated its performance on the standard Iris flower and MNIST datasets to confirm the practicality and scalability. "
