  "abstract": "  There are issues of trust with incumbent internet providers, and perhaps the potential for a new form of digital society. Large-scale social and immersive metaverse has low adoption and may not meet societal or business needs. From a business perspective, metaverse is not a good choice for remote collaboration. The term \"digital society\" may be more relevant and extend to spatial and augmented reality technologies, Web2, digital money, and trust. Investment in the recent Web3 bubble is coming from a curious blend of venture capitalists, and the `Meta', with a focus on distributed financial tooling and digital assets in the metaverse. A global ledger (such as blockchain) may be necessary to create transferable digital goods across society. Crypto has several problems, but its main strength is in creating \"money-like networks\". It is unclear which technology will succeed, but the tools are available now for integration and testing. Nostr is an exciting new protocol which has the potential to increase confidence in the end points of communication channels, mediate financial transaction, and link communities and virtual spaces. It, like Bitcoin, is opensource, and also likely impossible to censor. New open source AI tooling may address issues of accessibility, creativity, language barriers, safeguarding, and governance. Image generation ML may enable the creation of collaborative global networks at the boundaries of art and science. AI and ML, or \"supported creativity\" or \"augmented intelligence\" blur the interfaces between users and digital society. Building an inclusive, open, and federated metaverse with transparent governance is a complex challenge, but reasoning and potential solutions are explored in this book, alongside some initial tooling to experiment with.
