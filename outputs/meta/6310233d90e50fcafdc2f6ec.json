  "title": "Some properties of morphic images of (eventually) dendric words",
  "abstract": "  The class of (eventually) dendric words generalizes well-known families such as the Arnoux-Rauzy words or the codings of interval exchanges. There are still many open questions about the link between dendricity and morphisms. In this paper, we focus on two questions. The first one is the evolution of the factor complexity when applying a non-erasing morphism to an eventually dendric word. We next look at the morphisms that preserve dendricity for all dendric words and show that they are exactly those generated by the Arnoux-Rauzy morphisms. "
