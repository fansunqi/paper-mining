  "title": "Building Resilience to Climate Driven Extreme Events with Computing\n  Innovations: A Convergence Accelerator Report",
  "abstract": "  In 2022, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computing Research Association (CRA) to conduct a workshop to frame and scope a potential Convergence Accelerator research track on the topic of \"Building Resilience to Climate-Driven Extreme Events with Computing Innovations\". The CRA's research visioning committee, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), took on this task, organizing a two-part community workshop series, beginning with a small, in-person brainstorming meeting in Denver, CO on 27-28 October 2022, followed by a virtual event on 10 November 2022. The overall objective was to develop ideas to facilitate convergence research on this critical topic and encourage collaboration among researchers across disciplines. Based on the CCC community white paper entitled Computing Research for the Climate Crisis, we initially focused on five impact areas (i.e. application domains that are both important to society and critically affected by climate change): Energy, Agriculture, Environmental Justice, Transportation, and Physical Infrastructure.
