  "abstract": "  We present a model-agnostic algorithm for generating post-hoc explanations and uncertainty intervals for a machine learning model when only a sample of inputs and outputs from the model is available, rather than direct access to the model itself. This situation may arise when model evaluations are expensive; when privacy, security and bandwidth constraints are imposed; or when there is a need for real-time, on-device explanations. Our algorithm constructs explanations using local polynomial regression and quantifies the uncertainty of the explanations using a bootstrapping approach. Through a simulation study, we show that the uncertainty intervals generated by our algorithm exhibit a favorable trade-off between interval width and coverage probability compared to the naive confidence intervals from classical regression analysis. We further demonstrate the capabilities of our method by applying it to black-box models trained on two real datasets. "
