  "title": "AIREPAIR: A Repair Platform for Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "  We present AIREPAIR, a platform for repairing neural networks. It features the integration of existing network repair tools. Based on AIREPAIR, one can run different repair methods on the same model, thus enabling the fair comparison of different repair techniques. We evaluate AIREPAIR with three state-of-the-art repair tools on popular deep-learning datasets and models. Our evaluation confirms the utility of AIREPAIR, by comparing and analyzing the results from different repair techniques. A demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/UkKw5neeWhw. "
