  "title": "Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces",
  "abstract": "  We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees, and we discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson--Simpson theorem rather than (a strengthening of) the Halpern--L\\\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in existing literature (originating from work of Laver and Milliken). This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\\'e and Sauer, we give upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere. "
