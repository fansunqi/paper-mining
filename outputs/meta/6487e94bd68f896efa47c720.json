  "abstract": "  Quadratic programming over orthogonal matrices encompasses a broad class of hard optimization problems that do not have an efficient quantum representation. Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a generalization of binary quadratic programs to continuous, noncommutative variables. In this work, we establish a natural embedding for this class of LNCG problems onto a fermionic Hamiltonian, thereby enabling the study of this classical problem with the tools of quantum information. This embedding is accomplished by identifying the orthogonal group with its double cover, which can be represented as fermionic quantum states. Correspondingly, the embedded LNCG Hamiltonian is a two-body fermion model. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, a quantum analogue to classical semidefinite relaxations. In particular, when optimizing over the special orthogonal group our quantum relaxation obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential in matrix dimension, whereas our quantum representation requires only a linear number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution back into the feasible space, we propose rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from appropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we provide evidence that this rounded quantum relaxation can produce high-quality approximations. "
