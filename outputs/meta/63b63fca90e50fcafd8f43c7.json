  "title": "Exploring Complex Dynamical Systems via Nonconvex Optimization",
  "abstract": "  Cataloging the complex behaviors of dynamical systems can be challenging, even when they are well-described by a simple mechanistic model. If such a system is of limited analytical tractability, brute force simulation is often the only resort. We present an alternative, optimization-driven approach using tools from machine learning. We apply this approach to a novel, fully-optimizable, reaction-diffusion model which incorporates complex chemical reaction networks (termed \"Dense Reaction-Diffusion Network\" or \"Dense RDN\"). This allows us to systematically identify new states and behaviors, including pattern formation, dissipation-maximizing nonequilibrium states, and replication-like dynamical structures. "
