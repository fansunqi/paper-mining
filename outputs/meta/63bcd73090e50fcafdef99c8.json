  "title": "Quantum Honest Byzantine Agreement as a Distributed Quantum Algorithm",
  "abstract": "  We suggest that the Quantum Honest Byzantine Agreement (QHBA) protocol [1] essentially reduces consensus to coincidence. The volume of coincidence is the parameter that drives a receiver to echo its input. A lack of coincidence results in no output from a receiver. This is a similar mechanism therefore to the learning mechanism in cognitive modular neural architectures like Haikonen's architecture [2]. We introduce a simple feedback mechanism and quantum neuron to realize a hybrid quantum / classical machine learning network of simple nodes. "
