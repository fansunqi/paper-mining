  "abstract": "  The bundling of flagella is known to create a \"run\" phase, where the bacteria moves in a nearly straight line rather than making changes in direction. Historically, mechanical explanations for the bundling phenomenon intrigued many researchers, and significant advances were made in physical models and experimental methods. Contributing to the field of research, we present a bacteria-inspired centimeter-scale soft robotic hardware platform and a computational framework for a physically plausible simulation model of the multi-flagellated robot under low Reynolds number (~0.1). The fluid-structure interaction simulation couples the Discrete Elastic Rods algorithm with the method of Regularized Stokeslet Segments. Contact between two flagella is handled by a penalty-based method. We present a comparison between our experimental and simulation results and verify that the simulation tool can capture the essential physics of this problem. Preliminary findings on robustness to buckling provided by the bundling phenomenon and the efficiency of a multi-flagellated soft robot are compared with the single-flagellated counterparts. Observations were made on the coupling between geometry and elasticity, which manifests itself in the propulsion of the robot by nonlinear dependency on the rotational speed of the flagella. "
