  "abstract": "Dynamical models described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a\nfundamental tool in the sciences and engineering. Exact reduction aims at\nproducing a lower-dimensional model in which each macro-variable can be\ndirectly related to the original variables, and it is thus a natural step\ntowards the model's formal analysis and mechanistic understanding. We present\nan algorithm which, given a polynomial ODE model, computes a longest possible\nchain of exact linear reductions of the model such that each reduction refines\nthe previous one, thus giving a user control of the level of detail preserved\nby the reduction. This significantly generalizes over the existing approaches\nwhich compute only the reduction of the lowest dimension subject to an\napproach-specific constraint. The algorithm reduces finding exact linear\nreductions to a question about representations of finite-dimensional algebras.\nWe provide an implementation of the algorithm, demonstrate its performance on a\nset of benchmarks, and illustrate the applicability via case studies. Our\nimplementation is freely available at\nhttps://github.com/x3042/ExactODEReduction.jl"
