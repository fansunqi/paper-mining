  "abstract": "  In this paper, We present our approach for IEEEBigMM 2020, Grand Challenge (BMGC), Identifying senti-ments from tweets related to the MeToo movement. The modelis based on an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network,Bidirectional LSTM and a DNN for final classification. Thispaper is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of the modeland the results obtained. We have ranked 5th out of 10 teamswith a score of 0.51491 "
