  "abstract": "  A solar sail is one of the most promising space exploration system because of its theoretically infinite specific impulse using solar radiation pressure (SRP). Recently, some researchers proposed \"transformable spacecrafts\" that can actively reconfigure their body configurations with actuatable joints. The transformable spacecrafts are expected to greatly enhance orbit and attitude control capability due to its high redundancy in control degree of freedom if they are used as solar sails. However, its large number of input poses difficulties in control, and therefore, previous researchers imposed strong constraints to limit its potential control capabilities. This paper addresses novel attitude control techniques for the transformable spacecrafts under SRP. The authors have constructed two proposed methods; one of those is a joint angle optimization to acquire arbitrary SRP force and torque, and the other is a momentum damping control driven by joint angle actuation. Our proposed methods are formulated in general forms and applicable to any transformable solar sail that consists of flat and thin body components. Validity of the proposed methods are confirmed by numerical simulations. This paper contributes to making most of the high control redundancy of transformable solar sails without consuming any expendable propellants, which is expected to greatly enhance orbit and attitude control capability.
