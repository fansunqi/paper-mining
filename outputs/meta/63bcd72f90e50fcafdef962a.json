  "title": "Bayesian Weapon System Reliability Modeling with Cox-Weibull Neural\n  Network",
  "abstract": "  We propose to integrate weapon system features (such as weapon system manufacturer, deployment time and location, storage time and location, etc.) into a parameterized Cox-Weibull [1] reliability model via a neural network, like DeepSurv [2], to improve predictive maintenance. In parallel, we develop an alternative Bayesian model by parameterizing the Weibull parameters with a neural network and employing dropout methods such as Monte-Carlo (MC)-dropout for comparative purposes. Due to data collection procedures in weapon system testing we employ a novel interval-censored log-likelihood which incorporates Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) [3] sampling of the Weibull parameters during gradient descent optimization. We compare classification metrics such as receiver operator curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) AUC, and F scores to show our model generally outperforms traditional powerful models such as XGBoost and the current standard conditional Weibull probability density estimation model.
