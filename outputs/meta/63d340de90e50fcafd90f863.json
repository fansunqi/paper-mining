  "abstract": "We specialize techniques from topological data analysis to the problem of\ncharacterizing the topological complexity (as defined in the body of the paper)\nof a multi-class data set. As a by-product, a topological classifier is defined\nthat uses an open sub-covering of the data set. This sub-covering can be used\nto construct a simplicial complex whose topological features (e.g., Betti\nnumbers) provide information about the classification problem. We use these\ntopological constructs to study the impact of topological complexity on\nlearning in feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs). We hypothesize that\ntopological complexity is negatively correlated with the ability of a fully\nconnected feedforward deep neural network to learn to classify data correctly.\nWe evaluate our topological classification algorithm on multiple constructed\nand open source data sets. We also validate our hypothesis regarding the\nrelationship between topological complexity and learning in DNN's on multiple\ndata sets."
