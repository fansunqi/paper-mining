  "abstract": "  We study the problem of finding elements in the intersection of an arbitrary conic variety in $\\mathbb{F}^n$ with a given linear subspace (where $\\mathbb{F}$ can be the real or complex field). This problem captures a rich family of algorithmic problems under different choices of the variety. The special case of the variety consisting of rank-1 matrices already has strong connections to central problems in different areas like quantum information theory and tensor decompositions. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the worst-case, even for the variety of rank-1 matrices.   Surprisingly, despite these hardness results we give efficient algorithms that solve this problem for \"typical\" subspaces. Here, the subspace $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n$ is chosen generically of a certain dimension, potentially with some generic elements of the variety contained in it. Our main algorithmic result is a polynomial time algorithm that recovers all the elements of $U$ that lie in the variety, under some mild non-degeneracy assumptions on the variety. As corollaries, we obtain the following results:   $\\bullet$ Uniqueness results and polynomial time algorithms for generic instances of a broad class of low-rank decomposition problems that go beyond tensor decompositions. Here, we recover a decomposition of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^R v_i \\otimes w_i$, where the $v_i$ are elements of the given variety $X$. This implies new algorithmic results even in the special case of tensor decompositions.   $\\bullet$ Polynomial time algorithms for several entangled subspaces problems in quantum entanglement, including determining $r$-entanglement, complete entanglement, and genuine entanglement of a subspace. While all of these problems are NP-hard in the worst case, our algorithm solves them in polynomial time for generic subspaces of dimension up to a constant multiple of the maximum possible. "
