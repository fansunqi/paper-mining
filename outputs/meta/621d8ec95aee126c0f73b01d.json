  "abstract": "  We propose a new method for collision-free planning using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to transform between the robot's joint space and a latent space that captures only collision-free areas of the joint space, conditioned by an obstacle map. Generating multiple plausible trajectories is convenient in applications such as the manipulation of a robot arm by enabling the selection of trajectories that avoids collision with the robot or surrounding environment. In the proposed method, various trajectories that avoid obstacles can be generated by connecting the start and goal state with arbitrary line segments in this generated latent space. Our method provides this collision-free latent space, after which any planner, using any optimization conditions, can be used to generate the most suitable paths on the fly. We successfully verified this method with a simulated and actual UR5e 6-DoF robotic arm. We confirmed that different trajectories could be generated depending on optimization conditions. "
