  "title": "Evaluation of Mobile Network Slicing in a Logistics Distribution Center",
  "abstract": "  Logistics is a key economic sector where any optimization that reduces costs or improves service has a great impact on society at large. In this paper, the role of two 5G Network Slicing (NS) strategies in Smart Logistics is studied: the use of a static slice with a balance division of network resources and the use of a dynamic slice. To validate the potential gains of these strategies, a Distribution Center with 5G connectivity is simulated, recreating the activity that takes place in a real Smart Logistics scenario. Results show that a dynamic slice makes a more efficient usage of the network resources, improving the quality of service for the different traffic profiles, even when there is a traffic peak. This improvement ranges from 6.48\\% to 95.65\\%, depending on the specific traffic profile and the evaluated metric. "
