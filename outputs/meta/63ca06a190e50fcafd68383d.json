  "abstract": "  Detecting dangerous driving has been of critical interest for the past few years. However, a practical yet minimally intrusive solution remains challenging as existing technologies heavily rely on visual features or physical proximity. With this motivation, we explore the feasibility of purely using mmWave radars to detect dangerous driving behaviors. We first study characteristics of dangerous driving and find some unique patterns of range-doppler caused by 9 typical dangerous driving actions. We then develop a novel Fused-CNN model to detect dangerous driving instances from regular driving and classify 9 different dangerous driving actions. Through extensive experiments with 5 volunteer drivers in real driving environments, we observe that our system can distinguish dangerous driving actions with an average accuracy of > 95%. We also compare our models with existing state-of-the-art baselines to establish their significance. "
