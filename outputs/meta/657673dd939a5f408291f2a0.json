  "abstract": "Detecting Parkinson's Disease in its early stages using EEG data presents a\nsignificant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach, representing EEG\ndata as a 15-variate series of bandpower and peak frequency\nvalues/coefficients. The hypothesis is that this representation captures\nessential information from the noisy EEG signal, improving disease detection.\nStatistical features extracted from this representation are utilised as input\nfor interpretable machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and\nAdaBoost classifiers. Our classification pipeline is deployed within our\nproposed framework which enables high-importance data types and brain regions\nfor classification to be identified. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that\nwhile there is no significant regional importance, the N1 sleep data type\nexhibits statistically significant predictive power (p < 0.01) for early-stage\nParkinson's Disease classification. AdaBoost classifiers trained on the N1 data\ntype consistently outperform baseline models, achieving over 80% accuracy and\nrecall. Our classification pipeline statistically significantly outperforms\nbaseline models indicating that the model has acquired useful information.\nPaired with the interpretability (ability to view feature importance's) of our\npipeline this enables us to generate meaningful insights into the\nclassification of early stage Parkinson's with our N1 models. In Future, these\nmodels could be deployed in the real world - the results presented in this\npaper indicate that more than 3 in 4 early-stage Parkinson's cases would be\ncaptured with our pipeline."
