  "title": "Convolutional Learning on Multigraphs",
  "abstract": "  Graph convolutional learning has led to many exciting discoveries in diverse areas. However, in some applications, traditional graphs are insufficient to capture the structure and intricacies of the data. In such scenarios, multigraphs arise naturally as discrete structures in which complex dynamics can be embedded. In this paper, we develop convolutional information processing on multigraphs and introduce convolutional multigraph neural networks (MGNNs). To capture the complex dynamics of information diffusion within and across each of the multigraph's classes of edges, we formalize a convolutional signal processing model, defining the notions of signals, filtering, and frequency representations on multigraphs. Leveraging this model, we develop a multigraph learning architecture, including a sampling procedure to reduce computational complexity. The introduced architecture is applied towards optimal wireless resource allocation and a hate speech localization task, offering improved performance over traditional graph neural networks. "
