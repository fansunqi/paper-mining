  "abstract": "  Self-supervised learning has become a popular approach in recent years for its ability to learn meaningful representations without the need for data annotation. This paper proposes a novel image augmentation technique, overlaying images, which has not been widely applied in self-supervised learning. This method is designed to provide better guidance for the model to understand underlying information, resulting in more useful representations. The proposed method is evaluated using contrastive learning, a widely used self-supervised learning method that has shown solid performance in downstream tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique in improving the performance of self-supervised models. "
