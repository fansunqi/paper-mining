  "title": "Online Decision Making for Trading Wind Energy",
  "abstract": "  This paper proposes and develops a new algorithm for trading wind energy in electricity markets, within an online learning and optimization framework. In particular, we combine a component-wise adaptive variant of the gradient descent algorithm with recent advances in the feature-driven newsvendor model. This results in an online offering approach capable of leveraging data-rich environments, while adapting to non-stationary characteristics of energy generation and electricity markets, and with a minimal computational burden. The performance of our approach is analyzed based on several numerical experiments, showing both better adaptability to non-stationary uncertain parameters and significant economic gains. "
