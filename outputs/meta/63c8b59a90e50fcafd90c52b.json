  "abstract": "The relationship between electricity demand and weather is well established\nin power systems, along with the importance of behavioral and social aspects\nsuch as holidays and significant events. This study explores the link between\nelectricity demand and more nuanced information about social events. This is\ndone using mature Natural Language Processing (NLP) and demand forecasting\ntechniques. The results indicate that day-ahead forecasts are improved by\ntextual features such as word frequencies, public sentiments, topic\ndistributions, and word embeddings. The social events contained in these\nfeatures include global pandemics, politics, international conflicts,\ntransportation, etc. Causality effects and correlations are discussed to\npropose explanations for the mechanisms behind the links highlighted. This\nstudy is believed to bring a new perspective to traditional electricity demand\nanalysis. It confirms the feasibility of improving forecasts from unstructured\ntext, with potential consequences for sociology and economics."
