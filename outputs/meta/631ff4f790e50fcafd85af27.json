  "title": "A Generic Bundle Forwarding Interface",
  "abstract": "  A generic interface for determining the next hop(s) for a DTN bundle is a valuable contribution to DTN research and development as it decouples the topology-independent elements of bundle processing from the topology-dependent forwarding decision. We introduce a concept that greatly increases flexibility regarding the evaluation and deployment of DTN forwarding and routing techniques and facilitates the development of software stacks applicable to heterogeneous topologies.
