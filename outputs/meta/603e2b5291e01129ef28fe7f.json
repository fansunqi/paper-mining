  "abstract": "  Let $\\mathcal{G}$ be a minor-closed graph class. We say that a graph $G$ is a $k$-apex of $\\mathcal{G}$ if $G$ contains a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G\\setminus S$ belongs to $\\mathcal{G}.$ We denote by $\\mathcal{A}_k (\\mathcal{G})$ the set of all graphs that are $k$-apices of $\\mathcal{G}.$ We prove that every graph in the obstruction set of $\\mathcal{A}_k (\\mathcal{G}),$ i.e., the minor-minimal set of graphs not belonging to $\\mathcal{A}_k (\\mathcal{G}),$ has size at most $2^{2^{2^{2^{\\mathsf{poly}(k)}}}},$ where $\\mathsf{poly}$ is a polynomial function whose degree depends on the size of the minor-obstructions of $\\mathcal{G}.$ This bound drops to $2^{2^{\\mathsf{poly}(k)}}$ when $\\mathcal{G}$ excludes some apex graph as a minor.
