  "title": "Capacity Region of Asynchronous Multiple Access Channels with FTN",
  "abstract": "  This paper studies the capacity region of asynchronous multiple access channel (MAC) with faster-thanNyquist (FTN) signaling. We first express the capacity region in the frequency domain. Next, we calculate an achievable rate region in time domain and prove that it is identical to the capacity region calculated in the frequency domain. Our analysis confirms that asynchronous transmission and FTN bring in significant gains. "
