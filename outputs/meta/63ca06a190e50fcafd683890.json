  "title": "Booster: a Benchmark for Depth from Images of Specular and Transparent\n  Surfaces",
  "abstract": "Estimating depth from images nowadays yields outstanding results, both in\nterms of in-domain accuracy and generalization. However, we identify two main\nchallenges that remain open in this field: dealing with non-Lambertian\nmaterials and effectively processing high-resolution images. Purposely, we\npropose a novel dataset that includes accurate and dense ground-truth labels at\nhigh resolution, featuring scenes containing several specular and transparent\nsurfaces. Our acquisition pipeline leverages a novel deep space-time stereo\nframework, enabling easy and accurate labeling with sub-pixel precision. The\ndataset is composed of 606 samples collected in 85 different scenes, each\nsample includes both a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced\nstereo pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx), typical of modern mobile devices\nthat mount sensors with different resolutions. Additionally, we provide\nmanually annotated material segmentation masks and 15K unlabeled samples. The\ndataset is composed of a train set and two test sets, the latter devoted to the\nevaluation of stereo and monocular depth estimation networks. Our experiments\nhighlight the open challenges and future research directions in this field."
