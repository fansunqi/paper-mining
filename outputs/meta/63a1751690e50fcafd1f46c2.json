  "abstract": "  Cloud database is the key technology in cloud computing. The effective and efficient service quality of the cloud database is inseparable from communication technology, just as improving communication quality will reduce the concurrency phenomenon in the ticketing system. In order to visually observe the impact of communication on the cloud database, we propose a Communication-Database (C-D) Model with a single-server database over the quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel, which consists of three parts: CLIENTS SOURCE, COMMUNICATION SYSTEM and DATABASE SYSTEM. This paper uses the queuing model, M/G/1//K, to model the whole system. The C-D Model is analyzed in two cases: nonlinearity and linearity, which correspond to some instances of SISO and MIMO. The simulation results of average staying time, average number of transactions and other performance characteristics are basically consistent with the theoretical results, which verifies the validity of the C-D Model. The comparison of these experimental results also proves that poor communication quality does lead to the reduction in the quality of service. "
