  "abstract": "  A $k$-edge-weighting of $G$ is a mapping $\\omega:E(G)\\longrightarrow \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$. The edge-weighting of $G$ naturally induces a vertex-colouring $\\sigma_{\\omega}:V(G)\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ given by$\\sigma_{\\omega}(v)=\\sum_{u\\in N_G(v)}\\omega(vu)$ for every $v\\in V(G)$. The edge-weighting $\\omega$ is neighbour sum distinguishing if it yields a proper vertex-colouring $\\sigma_{\\omega}$, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\sigma_{\\omega}(u)\\neq \\sigma_{\\omega}(v)$ for every edge $uv$ of $G$.We investigate a neighbour sum distinguishing edge-weighting with local constraints, namely, we assume that the set of edges incident to a vertex of large degree is not monochromatic. A graph is nice if it has no components isomorphic to $K_2$. We prove that every nice graph with maximum degree at most~5 admits a neighbour sum distinguishing $(\\Delta(G)+2)$-edge-weighting such that all the vertices of degree at least~2 are incident with at least two edges of different weights. Furthermore, we prove that every nice graph admits a neighbour sum distinguishing $7$-edge-weighting such that all the vertices of degree at least~6 are incident with at least two edges of different weights. Finally, we show that nice bipartite graphs admit a neighbour sum distinguishing $6$-edge-weighting such that all the vertices of degree at least~2 are incident with at least two edges of different weights.
