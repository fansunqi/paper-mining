  "abstract": "  Given a data stream $\\mathcal{D} = \\langle a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m \\rangle$ of $m$ elements where each $a_i \\in [n]$, the Distinct Elements problem is to estimate the number of distinct elements in $\\mathcal{D}$.   Distinct Elements has been a subject of theoretical and empirical investigations over the past four decades resulting in space optimal algorithms for it.   All the current state-of-the-art algorithms are, however, beyond the reach of an undergraduate textbook owing to their reliance on the usage of notions such as pairwise independence and universal hash functions. We present a simple, intuitive, sampling-based space-efficient algorithm whose description and the proof are accessible to undergraduates with the knowledge of basic probability theory. "
