  "title": "Topology Analysis of the XRP Ledger",
  "abstract": "  XRP Ledger is one of the oldest, well-established blockchains. Despite the popularity of the XRP Ledger, little is known about its underlying peer-to-peer network. The structural properties of a network impact its efficiency, security and robustness. We aim to close the knowledge gap by providing a detailed analysis of the XRP overlay network.   In this paper we examine the graph-theoretic properties of the XRP Ledger peer-to-peer network and its temporal characteristics. We crawl the XRP Ledger over two months and collect 1,290 unique network snapshots. We uncover a small group of nodes that act as a networking backbone. In addition, we observe a high network churn, with a third of the nodes changing every five days. Our findings have strong implications for the resilience and safety of the XRP Ledger. "
