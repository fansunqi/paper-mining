  "title": "Bi-invariance for Uniform Strategies on Event Structures",
  "abstract": "  A recurring problem in game semantics is to enforce uniformity in strategies. Informally, a strategy is uniform when the Player's behaviour does not depend on the particular indexing of moves chosen by the Opponent. In game semantics, uniformity is used to define a resource modality !, that can be exploited for the semantics of programming languages.   In this paper we give a new account of uniformity for strategies on event structures. This work is inspired by an older idea due to Melli\\`es, that uniformity should be expressed as \"bi-invariance\" with respect to two interacting group actions. We explore the algebraic foundations of bi-invariance, adapt this idea to the language of event structures and define a general notion of uniform strategy in this context. Finally we revisit an existing approach to uniformity, and show how this arises as a special case of our constructions. "
