  "abstract": "  In this paper, the performance of a secure massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system adopting low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) is analyzed over spatially correlated wireless channels. A tight lower bound for the achievable secrecy rate is derived with artificial noise (AN) transmitted in the null space of the user channels. Using the analytical results, the impact of spatial correlation on the secrecy rate is explicitly evaluated in the presence of low-resolution DACs. The analytical observations reveal that using low-resolution DACs can be beneficial to the secrecy performance compared with ideal DACs, when the channels are strongly correlated and optimal power allocation is not employed.
