  "abstract": "  Diabetes Mellitus has no permanent cure to date and is one of the leading causes of death globally. The alarming increase in diabetes calls for the need to take precautionary measures to avoid/predict the occurrence of diabetes. This paper proposes HealthEdge, a machine learning-based smart healthcare framework for type 2 diabetes prediction in an integrated IoT-edge-cloud computing system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out between the two most used machine learning algorithms in the literature, Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR), using two real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that RF predicts diabetes with 6% more accuracy on average compared to LR. "
