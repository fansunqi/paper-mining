  "abstract": "  We solve the problem of automatically computing a new class of environment assumptions in two-player turn-based finite graph games which characterize an ``adequate cooperation'' needed from the environment to allow the system player to win. Given an $\\omega$-regular winning condition $\\Phi$ for the system player, we compute an $\\omega$-regular assumption $\\Psi$ for the environment player, such that (i) every environment strategy compliant with $\\Psi$ allows the system to fulfill $\\Phi$ (sufficiency), (ii) $\\Psi$ can be fulfilled by the environment for every strategy of the system (implementability), and (iii) $\\Psi$ does not prevent any cooperative strategy choice (permissiveness).   For parity games, which are canonical representations of $\\omega$-regular games, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the symbolic computation of adequately permissive assumptions and show that our algorithm runs faster and produces better assumptions than existing approaches -- both theoretically and empirically. To the best of our knowledge, for $\\omega$-regular games, we provide the first algorithm to compute sufficient and implementable environment assumptions that are also permissive. "
