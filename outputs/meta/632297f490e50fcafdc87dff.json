  "title": "TSFool: Crafting Highly-imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through\n  Multi-objective Black-box Attack to Fool RNN Classifiers",
  "abstract": "  Neural network (NN) classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although the existing gradient-based attacks achieve state-of-the-art performance in feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, they do not perform as well on time series classification with recurrent neural network (RNN) models. This is because the cyclical structure of RNN prevents direct model differentiation and the visual sensitivity of time series data to perturbations challenges the traditional local optimization objective of the adversarial attack. In this paper, a black-box method called TSFool is proposed to efficiently craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN classifiers. We propose a novel global optimization objective named Camouflage Coefficient to consider the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the perspective of class distribution, and accordingly refine the adversarial attack as a multi-objective optimization problem to enhance the perturbation quality. To get rid of the dependence on gradient information, we also propose a new idea that introduces a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples having otherness between their features and latent manifold, based on which the optimization solution can be heuristically approximated. Experiments on 10 UCR datasets are conducted to confirm that TSFool averagely outperforms existing methods with a 46.3% higher attack success rate, 87.4% smaller perturbation and 25.6% better Camouflage Coefficient at a similar time cost.
