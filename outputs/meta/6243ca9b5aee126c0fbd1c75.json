  "title": "Uniqueness of the Gibbs measure for the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model\n  on the infinite $\\Delta$-regular tree for large $\\Delta$",
  "abstract": "  In this paper we prove that for any integer $q\\geq 5$, the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the infinite $\\Delta$-regular tree has a unique Gibbs measure for all edge interaction parameters $w\\in [1-q/\\Delta,1)$, provided $\\Delta$ is large enough. This confirms a longstanding folklore conjecture. "
