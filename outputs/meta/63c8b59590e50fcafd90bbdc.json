  "abstract": "  In this article, we propose the Artificial Intelligence Security Taxonomy to systematize the knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities, and security controls of machine-learning-based (ML-based) systems. We first classify the damage caused by attacks against ML-based systems, define ML-specific security, and discuss its characteristics. Next, we enumerate all relevant assets and stakeholders and provide a general taxonomy for ML-specific threats. Then, we collect a wide range of security controls against ML-specific threats through an extensive review of recent literature. Finally, we classify the vulnerabilities and controls of an ML-based system in terms of each vulnerable asset in the system's entire lifecycle. "
