  "title": "Interpreting CNN Predictions using Conditional Generative Adversarial\n  Networks",
  "abstract": "  We propose a novel method that trains a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate visual interpretations of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To comprehend a CNN, the GAN is trained with information on how the CNN processes an image when making predictions. Supplying that information has two main challenges: how to represent this information in a form that is feedable to the GANs and how to effectively feed the representation to the GAN. To address these issues, we developed a suitable representation of CNN architectures by cumulatively averaging intermediate interpretation maps. We also propose two alternative approaches to feed the representations to the GAN and to choose an effective training strategy. Our approach learned the general aspects of CNNs and was agnostic to datasets and CNN architectures. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compares the proposed GANs with state-of-the-art approaches. We found that the initial layers of CNNs and final layers are equally crucial for interpreting CNNs upon interpreting the proposed GAN. We believe training a GAN to interpret CNNs would open doors for improved interpretations by leveraging fast-paced deep learning advancements.
