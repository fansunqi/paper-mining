  "title": "Secure Distributed Gram Matrix Multiplication",
  "abstract": "  The Gram matrix of a matrix $A$ is defined as $AA^T$ (or $A^T\\!A$). Computing the Gram matrix is an important operation in many applications, such as linear regression with the least squares method, where the explicit solution formula includes the Gram matrix of the data matrix. Secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) can be used to compute the product of two matrices using the help of worker servers. If a Gram matrix were computed using SDMM, the data matrix would need to be encoded twice, which causes an unnecessary overhead in the communication cost. We propose a new scheme for this purpose called secure distributed Gram matrix multiplication (SDGMM). It can leverage the advantages of computing a Gram matrix instead of a regular matrix product. "
