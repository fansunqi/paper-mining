  "title": "A quantum complexity approach to the Kirchberg Embedding Problem",
  "abstract": "  The Kirchberg Embedding Problem (KEP) asks if every C*-algebra embeds into an ultrapower of the Cuntz algebra $\\cal O_2$. Motivated by the recent refutation of the Connes Embedding Problem using the quantum complexity result MIP*=RE, we establish two quantum complexity consequences of a positive solution to KEP. Both results involve almost-commuting strategies to nonlocal games. "
