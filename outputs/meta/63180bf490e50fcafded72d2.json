  "title": "Convexifying Market Clearing of SoC-Dependent Bids from Merchant Storage\n  Participants",
  "abstract": "  State-of-charge (SoC) dependent bidding allows merchant storage participants to incorporate SoC-dependent operation and opportunity costs in a bid-based market clearing process. However, such a bid results in a non-convex cost function in the multi-interval economic dispatch and market clearing, limiting its implementation in practice. We show that a simple restriction on the bidding format removes the non-convexity, making the multi-interval dispatch of SoC-dependent bids a standard convex piece-wise linear program. "
