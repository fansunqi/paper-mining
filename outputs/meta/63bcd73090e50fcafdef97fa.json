  "title": "Facilitating Contrastive Learning of Discourse Relational Senses by\n  Exploiting the Hierarchy of Sense Relations",
  "abstract": "  Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task that involves identifying the sense or senses that hold between two adjacent spans of text, in the absence of an explicit connective between them. In both PDTB-2 and PDTB-3, discourse relational senses are organized into a three-level hierarchy ranging from four broad top-level senses, to more specific senses below them. Most previous work on implicit discourse relation recognition have used the sense hierarchy simply to indicate what sense labels were available. Here we do more -- incorporating the sense hierarchy into the recognition process itself and using it to select the negative examples used in contrastive learning. With no additional effort, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task. "
