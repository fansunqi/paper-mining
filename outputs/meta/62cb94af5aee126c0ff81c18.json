  "title": "A Tutorial on Event Detection using Social Media Data Analysis:\n  Applications, Challenges, and Open Problems",
  "abstract": "  In recent years, social media has become one of the most popular platforms for communication. These platforms allow users to report real-world incidents that might swiftly and widely circulate throughout the whole social network. A social event is a real-world incident that is documented on social media. Social gatherings could contain vital documentation of crisis scenarios. Monitoring and analyzing this rich content can produce information that is extraordinarily valuable and help people and organizations learn how to take action. In this paper, a survey on the potential benefits and applications of event detection with social media data analysis will be presented. Moreover, the critical challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in event detection will be methodically investigated by monitoring social media stream. Then, fundamental open questions and possible research directions will be introduced. "
