  "title": "Adaptive Dynamic Global Illumination",
  "abstract": "  We present an adaptive extension of probe based global illumination solution that enhances the response to dynamic changes in the scene while while also enabling an order of magnitude increase in probe count. Our adaptive sampling strategy carefully places samples in regions where we detect time varying changes in radiosity either due to a change in lighting, geometry or both. Even with large number of probes, our technique robustly updates the irradiance and visibility cache to reflect the most up to date changes without stalling the overall algorithm. Our bandwidth aware approach is largely an improvement over the original \\textit{Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination} while also remaining orthogonal to the recent advancements in the technique. "
