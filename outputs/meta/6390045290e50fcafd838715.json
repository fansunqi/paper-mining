  "title": "Towards A Most Probable Recovery in Optical Imaging",
  "abstract": "  Light is a complex-valued field. The intensity and phase of the field are affected by imaged objects. However, imaging sensors measure only real-valued non-negative intensities. This results in a nonlinear relation between the measurements and the unknown imaged objects. Moreover, the sensor readouts are corrupted by Poissonian-distributed photon noise. In this work, we seek the most probable object (or clear image), given noisy measurements, that is, maximizing the a-posteriori probability of the sought variables. Hence, we generalize annealed Langevin dynamics, tackling fundamental challenges in optical imaging, including phase recovery and Poisson (photon) denoising. We leverage deep neural networks, not for explicit recovery of the imaged object, but as an approximate gradient for a prior term. We show results on empirical data, acquired by a real experiment. We further show results of simulations. "
