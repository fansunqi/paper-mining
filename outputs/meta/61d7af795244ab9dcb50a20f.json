  "abstract": "  We present an index theory of equilibria for extensive form games. This requires developing an index theory for games where the strategy sets of players are general polytopes and their payoff functions are multiaffine in the product of these polytopes. Such polytopes arise from identifying (topologically) equivalent mixed strategies of a normal form game. "
