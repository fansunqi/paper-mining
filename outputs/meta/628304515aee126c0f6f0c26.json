  "abstract": "  Advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning have great potential to redefine how skin lesions are detected, mapped, tracked and documented. Here, We propose a 3D whole-body imaging system known as 3DSkin-mapper to enable automated detection, evaluation and mapping of skin lesions. A modular camera rig arranged in a cylindrical configuration was designed to automatically capture images of the entire skin surface of a subject synchronously from multiple angles. Based on the images, we developed algorithms for 3D model reconstruction, data processing and skin lesion detection and tracking based on deep convolutional neural networks. We also introduced a customised, user-friendly, and adaptable interface that enables individuals to interactively visualise, manipulate, and annotate the images. The proposed system is developed for skin lesion screening, the focus of this paper is to introduce the system instead of clinical study. Using synthetic and real images we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system by providing multiple views of a target skin lesion, enabling further 3D geometry analysis and longitudinal tracking. It takes only a few seconds to capture the entire skin surface, and about half an hour to process and analyse the images. Our experiments show that the proposed system allow fast and easy whole body 3D imaging. It can be used by dermatological clinics to conduct skin screening, detect and track skin lesions over time, identify suspicious lesions, and document pigmented lesions. The system can potentially save clinicians time and effort significantly. The 3D imaging and analysis has the potential to change the paradigm of whole body photography with many applications in skin diseases, including inflammatory and pigmentary disorders. "
