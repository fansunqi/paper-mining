  "title": "A Runtime Environment for Contract Automata",
  "abstract": "  Contract automata have been introduced for specifying applications through behavioural contracts and for synthesising their orchestrations as finite state automata. This paper addresses the realisation of applications from contract automata specifications. We present CARE, a new runtime environment to coordinate services implementing contracts that guarantees the adherence of the implementation to its contract. We discuss how CARE can be adopted to realise contract-based applications, its formal guarantees, and we identify the responsibilities of the involved business actors. Experiments show the benefits of adopting CARE with respect to manual implementations. "
