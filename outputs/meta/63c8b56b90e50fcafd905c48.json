  "title": "Applicable Regions of Spherical and Plane Wave Models for Extremely\n  Large-Scale Array Communications",
  "abstract": "  Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) communications can significantly improve the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution, and has great potential in next-generation mobile communication networks. A crucial problem in XL-array communications is to determine the boundary of applicable regions of the plane wave model (PWM) and spherical wave model (SWM). In this paper, we propose new PWM/SWM demarcations for XL-arrays from the viewpoint of channel gain and rank. Four sets of results are derived for four different array setups. First, an equi-power line is derived for a point-to-uniform linear array (ULA) scenario, where an inflection point is found at $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ central incident angles. Second, an equi-power surface is derived for a point-to-uniform planar array (UPA) scenario, and it is proved that $\\cos^2(\\phi) \\cos^2(\\varphi)=\\frac{1}{2}$ is a dividing curve, where $\\phi$ and $\\varphi$ denote the elevation and azimuth angles, respectively. Third, an accurate and explicit expression of the equi-rank surface is obtained for a ULA-to-ULA scenario. Finally, an approximated expression of the equi-rank surface is obtained for a ULA-to-UPA scenario. With the obtained closed-form expressions, the equi-rank surface for any antenna structure and any angle can be well estimated. Furthermore, the effect of scatterers is also investigated, from which some insights are drawn. "
