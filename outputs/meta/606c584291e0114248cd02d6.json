  "title": "Detecting of multi-modality in probabilistic regression models",
  "abstract": "  This paper focuses on building of models of stochastic systems with aleatoric uncertainty. The nature of the considered systems is such that the identical inputs can result in different outputs, i.e. the output is a random variable. The suggested in this paper algorithm targets an identification of multi-modal properties of the output distributions, even when they depend on the inputs and vary significantly throughout the dataset. This ability of the suggested method to recognise complex and not only bell-shaped distributions follows from its construction and is backed up by provided experimental results. In general, the suggested method belongs to the category of boosted ensemble learning techniques, where the single deterministic component can be an arbitrarily-chosen regression model. The algorithm does not require any special properties of the chosen regression model, other than having descriptive capabilities with some expected accuracy for the training data type. "
