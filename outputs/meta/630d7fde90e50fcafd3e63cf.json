  "title": "An Efficient Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Vehicles\n  in Unstructured Environments",
  "abstract": "  As a core part of autonomous driving systems, motion planning has received extensive attention from academia and industry. However, real-time trajectory planning capable of spatial-temporal joint optimization is challenged by nonholonomic dynamics, particularly in the presence of unstructured environments and dynamic obstacles. To bridge the gap, we propose a real-time trajectory optimization method that can generate a high-quality whole-body trajectory under arbitrary environmental constraints. By leveraging the differential flatness property of car-like robots, we simplify the trajectory representation and analytically formulate the planning problem while maintaining the feasibility of the nonholonomic dynamics. Moreover, we achieve efficient obstacle avoidance with a safe driving corridor for unmodelled obstacles and signed distance approximations for dynamic moving objects. We present comprehensive benchmarks with State-of-the-Art methods, demonstrating the significance of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and trajectory quality. Real-world experiments verify the practicality of our algorithm. We will release our codes for the research community "
