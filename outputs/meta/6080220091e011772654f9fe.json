  "abstract": "  NLP pipelines with limited or no labeled data, rely on unsupervised methods for document processing. Unsupervised approaches typically depend on clustering of terms or documents. In this paper, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm, Vec2GC (Vector to Graph Communities), an end-to-end pipeline to cluster terms or documents for any given text corpus. Our method uses community detection on a weighted graph of the terms or documents, created using text representation learning. Vec2GC clustering algorithm is a density based approach, that supports hierarchical clustering as well. "
