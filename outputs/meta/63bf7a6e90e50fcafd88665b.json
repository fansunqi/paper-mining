  "title": "Plug-in Channel Estimation with Dithered Quantized Signals in Spatially\n  Non-Stationary Massive MIMO Systems",
  "abstract": "As the array dimension of massive MIMO systems increases to unprecedented\nlevels, two problems occur. First, the spatial stationarity assumption along\nthe antenna elements is no longer valid. Second, the large array size results\nin an unacceptably high power consumption if high-resolution analog-to-digital\nconverters are used. To address these two challenges, we consider a Bussgang\nlinear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE)-based channel estimator for large\nscale massive MIMO systems with one-bit quantizers and a spatially\nnon-stationary channel. Whereas other works usually assume that the channel\ncovariance is known at the base station, we consider a plug-in BLMMSE estimator\nthat uses an estimate of the channel covariance and rigorously analyze the\ndistortion produced by using an estimated, rather than the true, covariance. To\ncope with the spatial non-stationarity, we introduce dithering into the\nquantized signals and provide a theoretical error analysis. In addition, we\npropose an angular domain fitting procedure which is based on solving an\ninstance of non-negative least squares. For the multi-user data transmission\nphase, we further propose a BLMMSE-based receiver to handle one-bit quantized\ndata signals. Our numerical results show that the performance of the proposed\nBLMMSE channel estimator is very close to the oracle-aided scheme with ideal\nknowledge of the channel covariance matrix. The BLMMSE receiver outperforms the\nconventional maximum-ratio-combining and zero-forcing receivers in terms of the\nresulting ergodic sum rate."
