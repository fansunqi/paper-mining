  "abstract": "  Ghomi proved that every convex polyhedron could be stretched via an affine transformation so that it has an edge-unfolding to a net [Gho14]. A net is a simple planar polygon; in particular, it does not self-overlap. One can view his result as establishing that every combinatorial polyhedron has a metric realization that allows unfolding to a net.   Joseph Malkevitch asked if the reverse holds (in some sense of ``reverse\"): Is there a combinatorial polyhedron such that, for every metric realization P in R^3, and for every spanning cut-tree T, P cut by T unfolds to a net? In this note we prove the answer is NO: every combinatorial polyhedron has a realization and a cut-tree that unfolds the polyhedron with overlap. "
