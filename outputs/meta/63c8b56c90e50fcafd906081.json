  "abstract": "We derive a novel uplink-downlink duality principle for optimal joint\nprecoding design under per-transmitter power and information constraints in\nfading channels. The information constraints model limited sharing of channel\nstate information and data bearing signals across the transmitters. The main\napplication is to cell-free networks, where each access point (AP) must\ntypically satisfy an individual power constraint and form its transmit signal\nusing limited cooperation capabilities. Our duality principle applies to\nergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be\ninterpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan\nfor deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to study involved\ninformation constraints going beyond the simple case of cluster-wise\ncentralized precoding covered by previous techniques. Specifically, we show\nthat the optimal joint precoders are, in general, given by an extension of the\nrecently developed team minimum mean-square error method. As a particular yet\npractical example, we then solve the problem of optimal local precoding design\nin user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power\nconstraints."
