  "title": "ADAPT : Awesome Domain Adaptation Python Toolbox",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce the ADAPT library, an open source Python API providing the implementation of the main transfer learning and domain adaptation methods. The library is designed with a user friendly approach to facilitate the access to domain adaptation for a wide public. ADAPT is compatible with scikit-learn and TensorFlow and a full documentation is proposed online https://adapt-python.github.io/adapt/ with a substantial gallery of examples. "
