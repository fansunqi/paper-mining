  "abstract": "  We study codes with parameters of the ternary Hamming $(n=(3^m-1)/2,3^{n-m},3)$ code, i.e., ternary $1$-perfect codes. The rank of the code is defined to be the dimension of its affine span. We characterize ternary $1$-perfect codes of rank $n-m+1$, count their number, and prove that all such codes can be obtained from each other by a sequence of two-coordinate switchings. We enumerate ternary $1$-perfect codes of length $13$ obtained by concatenation from codes of lengths $9$ and $4$; we find that there are $93241327$ equivalence classes of such codes.   Keywords: perfect codes, ternary codes, concatenation, switching. "
