  "title": "Optimization of the Analysis of Vital Events Using Threads",
  "abstract": "  Objective: Optimize the time of data analysis of Vital Events (births, deaths and marriages) using Threads. Methodology: A code was created in python without threads and another with threads, after He performed 5 tests with a single attribute and with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 attributes this was done in both codes with the same amount of data, to know if the python code with threads is optimal when parsing Vital Facts data. Results: The python code with Threads turned out to be the most optimal since it optimized the compilation time of the 5 tests with 1 attribute by 16attributes was obtained as a result that the more attributes you group, the more effective the use of threads. Conclusion: Python code with threads is more optimal than code without threads Therefore, it is concluded that the implementation of threads is recommended in the analysis of data in similar works. "
