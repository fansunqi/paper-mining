  "title": "Design and Validation of a Bimanual Haptic Epidural Needle Insertion\n  Simulator",
  "abstract": "  The case experience of anesthesiologists is one of the leading causes of accidental dural puncture and failed epidural - the most common complications of epidural analgesia. We designed a bimanual haptic simulator to train anesthesiologists and optimize epidural analgesia skill acquisition, and present a validation study conducted with 15 anesthesiologists of different competency levels from several hospitals in Israel. Our simulator emulates the forces applied on the epidural (Touhy) needle, held by one hand, and those applied on the Loss of Resistance (LOR) syringe, held by the second hand. The resistance is calculated based on a model of the Epidural region layers that is parameterized by the weight of the patient. We measured the movements of both haptic devices, and quantified the rate of results (success, failed epidurals and dural punctures), insertion strategies, and answers of participants to questionnaires about their perception of the realism of the simulation. We demonstrated good construct validity by showing that the simulator can distinguish between real-life novices and experts. Good face and content validity were shown in experienced users' perception of the simulator as realistic and well-targeted. We found differences in strategies between different level anesthesiologists, and suggest trainee-based instruction in advanced training stages. "
