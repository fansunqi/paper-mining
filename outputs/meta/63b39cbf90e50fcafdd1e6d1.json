  "abstract": "  This paper concerns realizing highly efficient information-theoretic robot exploration with desired performance in complex scenes. We build a continuous lightweight inference model to predict the mutual information (MI) and the associated prediction confidence of the robot's candidate actions which have not been evaluated explicitly. This allows the decision-making stage in robot exploration to run with a logarithmic complexity approximately, this will also benefit online exploration in large unstructured, and cluttered places that need more spatial samples to assess and decide. We also develop an objective function to balance the local optimal action with the highest MI value and the global choice with high prediction variance. Extensive numerical and dataset simulations show the desired efficiency of our proposed method without losing exploration performance in different environments. We also provide our open-source implementation codes released on GitHub for the robot community. "
