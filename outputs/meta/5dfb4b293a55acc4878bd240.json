  "title": "Extreme Values of the Fiedler Vector on Trees",
  "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a connected tree on $n$ vertices and let $L = D-A$ denote the Laplacian matrix on $G$. The second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}(G) > 0$, also known as the algebraic connectivity, as well as the associated eigenvector $\\phi_2$ have been of substantial interest. We investigate the question of when the maxima and minima of $\\phi_2$ are assumed at the endpoints of the longest path in $G$. Our results also apply to more general graphs that `behave globally' like a tree but can exhibit more complicated local structure. The crucial new ingredient is a reproducing formula for the eigenvector $\\phi_k$. "
