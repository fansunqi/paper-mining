  "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop an impairments-aware air-to-ground unified channel model that incorporates the effect of both wobbling and hardware impairments, where the former is caused by random physical fluctuations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the latter by intrinsic radio frequency (RF) nonidealities at both the transmitter and receiver, such as phase noise, in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, and power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. The impact of UAV wobbling is modeled by two stochastic processes, i.e., the canonical Wiener process and the more realistic sinusoidal process. On the other hand, the \\textit{aggregate} impact of all hardware impairments is modeled as two multiplicative and additive distortion noise processes, which is a well-accepted model. For the sake of generality, we consider both wide-sense stationary (WSS) and nonstationary processes for the distortion noises. We then rigorously characterize the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the wireless channel, using which we provide a comprehensive analysis of four key channel-related metrics: (i) power delay profile (PDP), (ii) coherence time, (iii) coherence bandwidth, and (iv) power spectral density (PSD) of the distortion-plus-noise process. Furthermore, we evaluate these metrics with reasonable UAV wobbling and hardware impairment models to obtain useful insights. Quite noticeably, we demonstrate that even for small UAV wobbling, the coherence time severely degrades at high frequencies, which renders air-to-ground channel estimation very difficult at these frequencies. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that characterizes the joint impact of UAV wobbling and hardware impairments on the air-to-ground wireless channel. "
