  "title": "Constacyclic codes of length $4p^s$ over the Galois ring $GR(p^a,m)$",
  "abstract": "  For prime $p$, $GR(p^a,m)$ represents the Galois ring of order $p^{am}$ and characterise $p$, where $a$ is any positive integer. In this article, we study the Type (1) $\\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $4p^s$ over the ring $GR(p^a,m)$, where $\\lambda=\\xi_0+p\\xi_1+p^2z$, $\\xi_0,\\xi_1\\in T(p,m)$ are nonzero elements and $z\\in GR(p^a,m)$. In first case, when $\\lambda$ is a square, we show that any ideal of $\\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\\lambda)=\\frac{GR(p^a,m)[x]}{\\langle x^{4p^s}-\\lambda\\rangle}$ is the direct sum of the ideals of $\\frac{GR(p^a,m)[x]}{\\langle x^{2p^s}-\\delta\\rangle}$ and $\\frac{GR(p^a,m)[x]}{\\langle x^{2p^s}+\\delta\\rangle}$. In second, when $\\lambda$ is not a square, we show that $\\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\\lambda)$ is a chain ring whose ideals are $\\langle (x^4-\\alpha)^i\\rangle\\subseteq \\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\\lambda)$, for $0\\leq i\\leq ap^s$ where $\\alpha^{p^s}=\\xi_0$. Also, we prove the dual of the above code is $\\langle (x^4-\\alpha^{-1})^{ap^s-i}\\rangle\\subseteq \\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\\lambda^{-1})$ and present the necessary and sufficient condition for these codes to be self-orthogonal and self-dual, respectively. Moreover, the Rosenbloom-Tsfasman (RT) distance, Hamming distance and weight distribution of Type (1) $\\lambda$-constacyclic codes of length $4p^s$ are obtained when $\\lambda$ is not a square. "
