  "title": "Complex hypergraphs",
  "abstract": "  Providing an abstract representation of natural and human complex structures is a challenging problem. Accounting for the system heterogenous components while allowing for analytical tractability is a difficult balance. Here I introduce complex hypergraphs (chygraphs), bringing together concepts from hypergraphs, multi-layer networks, simplicial complexes and hyperstructures. To illustrate the applicability of this combinatorial structure I calculate the component sizes statistics and identify the transition to a giant component. To this end I introduce a vectorization technique that tackles the multi-level nature of chygraphs. I conclude that chygraphs are a unifying representation of complex systems allowing for analytical insight. "
