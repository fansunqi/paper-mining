  "abstract": "  Bayesian networks are widely used to learn and reason about the dependence structure of discrete variables. However, they are only capable of formally encoding symmetric conditional independence, which in practice is often too strict to hold. Asymmetry-labeled DAGs have been recently proposed to both extend the class of Bayesian networks by relaxing the symmetric assumption of independence and denote the type of dependence existing between the variables of interest. Here, we introduce novel structural learning algorithms for this class of models which, whilst being efficient, allow for a straightforward interpretation of the underlying dependence structure. A comprehensive computational study highlights the efficiency of the algorithms. A real-world data application using data from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale collected in Italy showcases their use in practice. "
