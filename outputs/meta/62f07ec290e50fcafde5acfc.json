  "abstract": "  We present our preliminary work on a multi-agent system involving the complex human phenomena of identity and dynamic teams. We outline our ongoing experimentation into understanding how these factors can eliminate some of the naive assumptions of current multi-agent approaches. These include a lack of complex heterogeneity between agents and unchanging team structures. We outline the human social psychological basis for identity, one's sense of self, and dynamic teams, the changing nature of human teams. We describe our application of these factors to a multi-agent system and our expectations for how they might improve the system's applicability to more complex problems, with specific relevance to ad hoc teamwork. We expect that the inclusion of more complex human processes, like identity and dynamic teams, will help with the eventual goal of having effective human-agent teams. "
