  "abstract": "  Feature embedding-based methods have shown exceptional performance in detecting industrial anomalies by comparing features of target images with normal images. However, some methods do not meet the speed requirements of real-time inference, which is crucial for real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Fast Adaptive Patch Memory (FAPM) for real-time industrial anomaly detection. FAPM utilizes patch-wise and layer-wise memory banks that store the embedding features of images at the patch and layer level, respectively, which eliminates unnecessary repetitive computations. We also propose patch-wise adaptive coreset sampling for faster and more accurate detection. FAPM performs well in both accuracy and speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods "
