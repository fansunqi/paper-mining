  "title": "The Theory of an Arbitrary Higher $\\lambda$-Model",
  "abstract": "  One takes advantage of some basic properties of every homotopic $\\lambda$-model (e.g.\\ extensional Kan complex) to explore the higher $\\beta\\eta$-conversions, which would correspond to proofs of equality between terms of a theory of equality of any extensional Kan complex. Besides, Identity types based on computational paths are adapted to a type-free theory with higher $\\lambda$-terms, whose equality rules would be contained in the theory of any $\\lambda$-homotopic model.
