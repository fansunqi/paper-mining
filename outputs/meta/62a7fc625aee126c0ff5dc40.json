  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a multi-hop cooperative network founded on two energy-harvesting (EH) decode-and-forward (DF) relays which are provided with harvest-store-use (HSU) architecture to harvest energy from the ambience using the energy buffers. For the sake of boosting the data delivery in this network, maximal ratio combining (MRC) at destination to combine the signals received from source and relays, as well as an opportunistic routing (OR) algorithm which considers channel status information, location and energy buffer status of relays is proposed. With applying discrete-time continuous-state space Markov chain model (DCSMC), the algorithm-based theoretical expression for limiting distribution of stored energy in infinite-size buffer is derived. Further more, with using both the limiting distributions of energy buffers and the probability of transmitter candidates set, the algorithm-based theoretical expressions for outage probability, throughput and timesolt cost for each data of the network are obtained. The simulation results are presented to validate the derived algorithm-based theoretical expressions. "
