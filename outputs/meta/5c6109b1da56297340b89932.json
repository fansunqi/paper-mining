  "abstract": "  PageRank is used by Google for ranking web pages to present search results for a user query. Here, we have shown that the PageRank of a vertex depends on its initial value which is also known as an intrinsic, non-network contribution. We analytically proved that PageRank value of vertices become proportional to their degrees if the intrinsic, non-network contributions of the vertices are proportional to their degrees or zeros. Simulated and empirical data are used to support our study. In addition, we have shown that localization of PageRank depends on the intrinsic, non-network contribution. "
