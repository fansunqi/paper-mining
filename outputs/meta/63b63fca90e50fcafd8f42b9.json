  "abstract": "  Model-based mutation analysis is a recent research area, and real-time system testing can benefit from using model mutants. Model-based mutation testing (MBMT) is a particular branch of model-based testing. It generates faulty versions of a model using mutation operators to evaluate and improve test cases. Mutation testing is an effective way to ensure software correctness and has been applied to various application areas. Simulink is a vital modeling language for real-time systems. This paper introduces Simulink model mutation analysis to improve Model-in-the-loop (MIL) testing. We propose a set of Simulink mutation operators based on AUTOSAR, which reflects the temporal correctness when a Simulink model is mapped to Operating System tasks. We implement a mutation framework that generates mutants for implicit clock Simulink models. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework generates mutants to reveal task interference issues in the simulation. Our work integrates the Simulink model with the timed systems to better support mutation testing automation. "
