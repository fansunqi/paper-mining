  "title": "Towards Managing the Migration to Post-Quantum-Cryptography",
  "abstract": "  As soon as cryptographically relevant quantum computers exist, they can break today's prevalent asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. Organizations (and the IT society) have to plan on migrating to quantum-resilient cryptographic measures, also known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC). However, this is a difficult task, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no generalized approach to manage such a complex migration for cryptography used in IT systems. PMMP helps organizations manage the migration to PQC and establish crypto-agility. Having finished the initial theoretical design phase, we are now looking to promote PMMP to encourage practitioners to join the effort and work with us to develop it further. "
