  "title": "Causal Discovery for Gene Regulatory Network Prediction",
  "abstract": "  Biological systems and processes are networks of complex nonlinear regulatory interactions between nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. A natural way in which to represent these interaction networks is through the use of a graph. In this formulation, each node represents a nucleic acid, protein, or metabolite and edges represent intermolecular interactions (inhibition, regulation, promotion, coexpression, etc.). In this work, a novel algorithm for the discovery of latent graph structures given experimental data is presented. "
