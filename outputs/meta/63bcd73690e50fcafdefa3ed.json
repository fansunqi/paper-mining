  "title": "TinyVers: A Tiny Versatile System-on-chip with State-Retentive eMRAM for\n  ML Inference at the Extreme Edge",
  "abstract": "  Extreme edge devices or Internet-of-thing nodes require both ultra-low power always-on processing as well as the ability to do on-demand sampling and processing. Moreover, support for IoT applications like voice recognition, machine monitoring, etc., requires the ability to execute a wide range of ML workloads. This brings challenges in hardware design to build flexible processors operating in ultra-low power regime. This paper presents TinyVers, a tiny versatile ultra-low power ML system-on-chip to enable enhanced intelligence at the Extreme Edge. TinyVers exploits dataflow reconfiguration to enable multi-modal support and aggressive on-chip power management for duty-cycling to enable smart sensing applications. The SoC combines a RISC-V host processor, a 17 TOPS/W dataflow reconfigurable ML accelerator, a 1.7 $\\mu$W deep sleep wake-up controller, and an eMRAM for boot code and ML parameter retention. The SoC can perform up to 17.6 GOPS while achieving a power consumption range from 1.7 $\\mu$W-20 mW. Multiple ML workloads aimed for diverse applications are mapped on the SoC to showcase its flexibility and efficiency. All the models achieve 1-2 TOPS/W of energy efficiency with power consumption below 230 $\\mu$W in continuous operation. In a duty-cycling use case for machine monitoring, this power is reduced to below 10 $\\mu$W. "
