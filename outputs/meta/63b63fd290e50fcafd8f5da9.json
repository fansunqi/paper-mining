  "title": "Technology Trends for Massive MIMO towards 6G",
  "abstract": "  At the dawn of the next-generation wireless systems and networks, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been envisioned as one of the enabling technologies. With the continued success of being applied in the 5G and beyond, the massive MIMO technology has demonstrated its advantageousness, integrability, and extendibility. Moreover, several evolutionary features and revolutionizing trends for massive MIMO have gradually emerged in recent years, which are expected to reshape the future 6G wireless systems and networks. Specifically, the functions and performance of future massive MIMO systems will be enabled and enhanced via combining other innovative technologies, architectures, and strategies such as intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs)/intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), artificial intelligence (AI), THz communications, cell free architecture. Also, more diverse vertical applications based on massive MIMO will emerge and prosper, such as wireless localization and sensing, vehicular communications, non-terrestrial communications, remote sensing, inter-planetary communications.
