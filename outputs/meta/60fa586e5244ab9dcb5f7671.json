  "title": "Specifying a Game-Theoretic Extensive Form as an Abstract 5-ary Relation",
  "abstract": "  This paper specifies an extensive form as a 5-ary relation (that is, as a set of quintuples) which satisfies eight abstract axioms. Each quintuple is understood to list a player, a situation (a concept which generalizes an information set), a decision node, an action, and a successor node. Accordingly, the axioms are understood to specify abstract relationships between players, situations, nodes, and actions. Such an extensive form is called a \"pentaform\". A \"pentaform game\" is then defined to be a pentaform together with utility functions. The paper's main result is to construct an intuitive bijection between pentaform games and $\\mathbf{Gm}$ games (Streufert 2021, arXiv:2105.11398), which are centrally located in the literature, and which encompass all finite-horizon or infinite-horizon discrete games. In this sense, pentaform games equivalently formulate almost all extensive-form games. Secondary results concern disaggregating pentaforms by subsets, constructing pentaforms by unions, and initial applications to Selten subgames and perfect-recall (an extensive application to dynamic programming is in Streufert 2023, arXiv:2302.03855).
