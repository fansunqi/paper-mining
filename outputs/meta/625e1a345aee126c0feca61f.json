  "title": "Integrated In-vehicle Monitoring System Using 3D Human Pose Estimation\n  and Seat Belt Segmentation",
  "abstract": "  Recently, along with interest in autonomous vehicles, the importance of monitoring systems for both drivers and passengers inside vehicles has been increasing. This paper proposes a novel in-vehicle monitoring system the combines 3D pose estimation, seat-belt segmentation, and seat-belt status classification networks. Our system outputs various information necessary for monitoring by accurately considering the data characteristics of the in-vehicle environment. Specifically, the proposed 3D pose estimation directly estimates the absolute coordinates of keypoints for a driver and passengers, and the proposed seat-belt segmentation is implemented by applying a structure based on the feature pyramid. In addition, we propose a classification task to distinguish between normal and abnormal states of wearing a seat belt using results that combine 3D pose estimation with seat-belt segmentation. These tasks can be learned simultaneously and operate in real-time. Our method was evaluated on a private dataset we newly created and annotated. The experimental results show that our method has significantly high performance that can be applied directly to real in-vehicle monitoring systems. "
