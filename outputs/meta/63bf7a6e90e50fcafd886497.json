  "abstract": "Informally, a grassroots system is a distributed system that can have\nmultiple instances, independent of each other and of any global resources, that\ncan interoperate once interconnected. Grassroots applications are potentially\nimportant as they may allow people to conduct their social, economic, civic,\nand political lives in the digital realm solely using the networked computing\ndevices they own and operate (e.g., smartphones), free of third-party control,\nsurveillance, manipulation, coercion, or rent seeking (e.g., by global digital\nplatforms such as Facebook or Bitcoin).\n  Here, we formalize the notion of grassroots systems and grassroots\nimplementations; specify an abstract grassroots dissemination protocol;\ndescribe and prove an implementation of grassroots dissemination for the model\nof asynchrony; extend the implementation to mobile (address-changing) devices\nthat communicate via an unreliable network (e.g. smartphones using UDP); and\ndiscuss how grassroots dissemination can realize applications that support\ndigital sovereignty \u2013 grassroots social networking and grassroots currencies.\nThe mathematical construction employs distributed multiagent transition systems\nto define the notions of grassroots protocols and grassroots implementations,\nto specify grassroots dissemination protocols and their implementation, and to\nprove their correctness. The implementation uses the blocklace \u2013 a\ngeneralization of the blockchain that functions as a fault-tolerant,\nconflict-free replicated data type."
