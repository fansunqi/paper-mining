  "abstract": "  In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), it is critical for agents to achieve a balance between self-exploration and team collaboration. However, agents can hardly accomplish the team task without coordination and they would be trapped in a local optimum where easy cooperation is accessed without enough individual exploration. Recent works mainly concentrate on agents' coordinated exploration, which brings about the exponentially grown exploration of the state space. To address this issue, we propose Self-Motivated Multi-Agent Exploration (SMMAE), which aims to achieve success in team tasks by adaptively finding a trade-off between self-exploration and team cooperation. In SMMAE, we train an independent exploration policy for each agent to maximize their own visited state space. Each agent learns an adjustable exploration probability based on the stability of the joint team policy. The experiments on highly cooperative tasks in StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark (SMAC) demonstrate that SMMAE can explore task-related states more efficiently, accomplish coordinated behaviours and boost the learning performance.
