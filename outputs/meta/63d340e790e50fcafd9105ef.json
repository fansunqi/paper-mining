  "title": "Reachability in Injective Piecewise Affine Maps",
  "abstract": "  One of the most basic, longstanding open problems in the theory of dynamical systems is whether reachability is decidable for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps with two intervals. In this paper we prove that for injective maps, it is decidable. We also study various related problems, in each case either establishing decidability, or showing that they are closely connected to Diophantine properties of certain transcendental numbers, analogous to the positivity problem for linear recurrence sequences. Lastly, we consider topological properties of orbits of one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, not necessarily with two intervals, and negatively answer a question of Bournez, Kurganskyy, and Potapov, about the set of orbits in expanding maps.
