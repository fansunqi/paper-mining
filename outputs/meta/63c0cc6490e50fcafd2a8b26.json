  "title": "Adaptive Context Selection for Polyp Segmentation",
  "abstract": "  Accurate polyp segmentation is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, it has always been very challenging due to the diverse shape and size of polyp. In recent years, state-of-the-art methods have achieved significant breakthroughs in this task with the help of deep convolutional neural networks. However, few algorithms explicitly consider the impact of the size and shape of the polyp and the complex spatial context on the segmentation performance, which results in the algorithms still being powerless for complex samples. In fact, segmentation of polyps of different sizes relies on different local and global contextual information for regional contrast reasoning. To tackle these issues, we propose an adaptive context selection based encoder-decoder framework which is composed of Local Context Attention (LCA) module, Global Context Module (GCM) and Adaptive Selection Module (ASM). Specifically, LCA modules deliver local context features from encoder layers to decoder layers, enhancing the attention to the hard region which is determined by the prediction map of previous layer. GCM aims to further explore the global context features and send to the decoder layers. ASM is used for adaptive selection and aggregation of context features through channel-wise attention. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the EndoScene and Kvasir-SEG Datasets, and shows outstanding performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
