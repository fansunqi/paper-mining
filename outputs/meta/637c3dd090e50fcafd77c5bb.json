  "title": "Deepfake Detection: A Comprehensive Study from the Reliability\n  Perspective",
  "abstract": "  The mushroomed Deepfake synthetic materials circulated on the internet have raised serious social impact to politicians, celebrities, and every human being on earth. In this survey, we provide a thorough review of the existing Deepfake detection studies from the reliability perspective. Reliability-oriented research challenges of the current Deepfake detection research domain are defined in three aspects, namely, transferability, interpretability, and robustness. While solutions have been frequently addressed regarding the three challenges, the general reliability of a detection model has been barely considered, leading to the lack of reliable evidence in real-life usages and even for prosecutions on Deepfake-related cases in court. We, therefore, introduce a model reliability study metric using statistical random sampling knowledge and the publicly available benchmark datasets to review the reliability of the existing detection models on arbitrary Deepfake candidate suspects. Case studies are further executed to justify the real-life Deepfake cases including different groups of victims with the help of the reliably qualified detection models as reviewed in this survey. Reviews and experiments upon the existing approaches provide informative discussions and future research directions of Deepfake detection. "
