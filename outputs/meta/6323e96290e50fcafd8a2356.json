  "title": "Nonlinear dynamic analysis of asymmetric bistable energy harvesters",
  "abstract": "  The present paper investigates the dynamic behavior of nonlinear vibration energy harvesting systems, focusing on the effects of asymmetry caused by manufacturing imperfections. Bifurcation diagrams and basins of attraction analysis are used to examine the local and global characteristics of the underlying dynamical systems. The study explores the impact of different levels of asymmetry and the influence of the sloping angle, showing the best scenarios for increasing power output. The results highlight the adverse effects of asymmetries but also demonstrate that it is possible to overcome these effects by compensating for asymmetric influence through the sloping angle, resulting in good performance comparable to a symmetric system. This comprehensive numerical study provides valuable insights into the nonlinear dynamics of these complex systems, filling the current gap in understanding their behavior. "
