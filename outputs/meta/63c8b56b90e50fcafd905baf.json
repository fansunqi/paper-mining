  "title": "Improving Confidentiality for NFT Referenced Data Stores",
  "abstract": "  A non-fungible token (NFT) references a data store location, typically, using a URL or another unique identifier. At the minimum, a NFT is expected to guarantee ownership and control over the tokenised asset. However, information stored on a third party data store may be copied and stolen. We propose a solution to give control back to the information owner by storing encrypted content on the data store and providing additional security against hacks and zero day exploits. The content on our data store is never decrypted or returned to its owner for decryption during rekeying. Also, the key size in our protocol does not increase with each rekeying. With this, we reduce the synchronisation steps and maintain a bounded key size. "
