  "title": "Changing agents and ascribing beliefs in dynamic epistemic logic",
  "abstract": "  In dynamic epistemic logic (Van Ditmarsch, Van Der Hoek, & Kooi, 2008) it is customary to use an action frame (Baltag & Moss, 2004; Baltag, Moss, & Solecki, 1998) to describe different views of a single action. In this article, action frames are extended to add or remove agents, we call these agent-update frames. This can be done selectively so that only some specified agents get information of the update, which can be used to model several interesting examples such as private update and deception, studied earlier by Baltag and Moss (2004); Sakama (2015); Van Ditmarsch, Van Eijck, Sietsma, and Wang (2012). The product update of a Kripke model by an action frame is an abbreviated way of describing the transformed Kripke model which is the result of performing the action. This is substantially extended to a sum-product update of a Kripke model by an agent-update frame in the new setting. These ideas are applied to an AI problem of modelling a story. We show that dynamic epistemic logics, with update modalities now based on agent-update frames, continue to have sound and complete proof systems. Decision procedures for model checking and satisfiability have expected complexity. For a sublanguage, there are polynomial space algorithms. "
