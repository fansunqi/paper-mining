  "title": "Solving the Maximum Popular Matching Problem with Matroid Constraints",
  "abstract": "  We consider the problem of finding a maximum popular matching in a many-to-many matching setting with two-sided preferences and matroid constraints. This problem was proposed by Kamiyama (2020) and solved in the special case where matroids are base orderable. Utilizing a newly shown matroid exchange property, we show that the problem is tractable for arbitrary matroids. We further investigate a different notion of popularity, where the agents vote with respect to lexicographic preferences, and show that both existence and verification problems become NP-hard, even in the $b$-matching case.
