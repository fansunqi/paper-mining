  "abstract": "  Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring rapid action across society. As artificial intelligence tools (AI) are rapidly deployed, it is therefore crucial to understand how they will impact climate action. On the one hand, AI can support applications in climate change mitigation (reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions), adaptation (preparing for the effects of a changing climate), and climate science. These applications have implications in areas ranging as widely as energy, agriculture, and finance. At the same time, AI is used in many ways that hinder climate action (e.g., by accelerating the use of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels). In addition, AI technologies have a carbon and energy footprint themselves. This symposium brought together participants from across academia, industry, government, and civil society to explore these intersections of AI with climate change, as well as how each of these sectors can contribute to solutions.
