  "title": "MARS: Message Passing for Antenna and RF Chain Selection for Hybrid\n  Beamforming in MIMO Communication Systems",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a prospective receiving hybrid beamforming structure consisting of several radio frequency (RF) chains and abundant antenna elements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Due to conventional costly full connections, we design an enhanced partially-connected beamformer employing low-density parity-check (LDPC) based structure. As a benefit of LDPC-based structure, information can be exchanged among clustered RF/antenna groups, which results in a low computational complexity order. Advanced message passing (MP) capable of inferring and transferring information among different paths is designed to support LDPC-based hybrid beamformer. We propose a message passing enhanced antenna and RF chain selection (MARS) scheme to minimize the operational power of antennas and RF chains of the receiver. Furthermore, sequential and parallel MP for MARS are respectively designed as MARS-S and MARS-P schemes to address convergence speed issue. Simulations have validated the convergence of both the MARS-P and the MARS-S algorithms. Owing to asynchronous information transfer of MARS-P, it reveals that higher power is required than that of MARS-S, which strikes a compelling balance between power consumption, convergence, and computational complexity. It is also demonstrated that the proposed MARS scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks using heuristic method of fully-/partially-connected architectures in open literature in terms of the lowest power and highest energy efficiency.
