  "abstract": "  The growing landscape of emerging wireless applications is a key driver toward the development of novel wireless system designs. Such a design can be based on the metaverse that uses a virtual model of the physical world systems along with other schemes/technologies (e.g., optimization theory, machine learning, and blockchain). A metaverse using a virtual model performs proactive intelligent analytics prior to a user request for efficient management of the wireless system resources. Additionally, a metaverse will enable self-sustainability to operate wireless systems with the least possible intervention from network operators. Although the metaverse can offer many benefits, it faces some challenges as well. Therefore, in this tutorial, we discuss the role of a metaverse in enabling wireless applications. We present an overview, key enablers, design aspects (i.e., metaverse for wireless and wireless for metaverse), and a novel high-level architecture of metaverse-based wireless systems. We discuss metaverse management, reliability, and security of the metaverse-based system. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances and standardization of metaverse-enabled wireless system. Finally, we outline open challenges and present possible solutions. "
