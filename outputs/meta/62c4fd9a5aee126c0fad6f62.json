  "abstract": "  The advance towards higher levels of automation within the field of automated driving is accompanied by increasing requirements for the operational safety of vehicles. Induced by the limitation of computational resources, trade-offs between the computational complexity of algorithms and their potential to ensure safe operation of automated vehicles are often encountered. Situation-aware environment perception presents one promising example, where computational resources are distributed to regions within the perception area that are relevant for the task of the automated vehicle. While prior map knowledge is often leveraged to identify relevant regions, in this work, we present a lightweight identification of safety-relevant regions that relies solely on online information. We show that our approach enables safe vehicle operation in critical scenarios, while retaining the benefits of non-uniformly distributed resources within the environment perception. "
