  "abstract": "  In this article, a quasi-sliding mode control (QSMC) based on MPC is proposed for the constrained continuous-time nonlinear system with external disturbances. The MPC problem is formulated relating to the design of QSMC, to generate the control input, which can imitate the control process of QSMC and guarantee the satisfaction of state and input constraints. Meanwhile, the cost function of MPC problem is reconstructed, in which the QSMC based on MPC can show better convergence rate by tuning the weight parameters. Finally, a simulation case is provided to demonstate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. "
