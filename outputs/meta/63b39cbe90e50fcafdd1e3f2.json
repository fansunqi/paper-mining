  "title": "Selection of Centrality Measures Using Self-Consistency and Bridge\n  Axioms",
  "abstract": "  We consider several families of network centrality measures induced by graph kernels. The Self-consistency and Bridge axioms that appeared earlier in the literature turn out to be closely related to two of these families. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition of Self-consistency, a sufficient condition of the Bridge axiom, indicate specific measures that satisfy these axioms, and show that under some additional conditions they are incompatible. It is also shown that PageRank centrality violates most conditions under consideration, and has a property that, according to some authors, is hardly imaginable for a centrality measure. Adopting such conditions as the Self-consistency or Bridge axioms allows one to drastically reduce the length of a survey for selecting the most appropriate centrality measures in the culling method proposed by the present author jointly with Dmitry Gubanov (2020).
