  "abstract": "  Solving high dimensional optimal control problems and corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs are important but challenging problems in control engineering. In this paper, we propose two abstract neural network architectures which are respectively used to compute the value function and the optimal control for certain class of high dimensional optimal control problems. We provide the mathematical analysis for the two abstract architectures. We also show several numerical results computed using the deep neural network implementations of these abstract architectures. A preliminary implementation of our proposed neural network architecture on FPGAs shows promising speed up compared to CPUs. This work paves the way to leverage efficient dedicated hardware designed for neural networks to solve high dimensional optimal control problems and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. "
