  "abstract": "  We propose the first generalization of the famous Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proofs to quantum languages (NIZKoQS) and we provide a protocol to prove advanced properties on a received quantum state non-destructively and non-interactively (a single message being sent from the prover to the verifier).   In our second orthogonal contribution, we improve the costly Remote State Preparation protocols [CCKW18,CCKW19,GV19] that can classically fake a quantum channel (this is at the heart of our NIZKoQS protocol) by showing how to create a multi-qubits state from a single superposition.   Finally, we generalize these results to a multi-party setting and prove that multiple parties can anonymously distribute a GHZ state in such a way that only participants knowing a secret credential can share this state, which could have applications to quantum anonymous transmission, quantum secret sharing, quantum onion routing and more.
