  "abstract": "  We present a method to extract temporal hypergraphs from sequences of 2-dimensional functions obtained as solutions to Optimal Transport problems. We investigate optimality principles exhibited by these solutions from the point of view of hypergraph structures. Discrete properties follow patterns that differ from those characterizing their continuous counterparts. Analyzing these patterns can bring new insights into the studied transportation principles. We also compare these higher-order structures to their network counterparts in terms of standard graph properties. We give evidence that some transportation schemes might benefit from hypernetwork representations. We demonstrate our method on real data by analyzing the properties of hypernetworks extracted from images of real systems. "
