  "abstract": "  Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies rely on distributed consensus algorithms. In recent years many consensus algorithms and protocols have been proposed; most of them are for permissioned blockchain networks. However, the performance of these algorithms is not well understood. This paper introduces an approach to evaluating consensus algorithms and blockchain platforms in a hostile network environment with the presence of byzantine and other network failures. The approach starts by using stochastic modeling to model the behaviors of consensus algorithms under different typical and faulty operational scenarios. Next, we implemented a blockchain application using different consensus protocols and tested their performance using chaos engineering techniques. To demonstrate our generic evaluation approach, we analyze the performance of four permissioned blockchain platforms and their consensus protocols. Our results showed that stochastic modeling is an inexpensive and efficient technique for analyzing consensus protocols. But they do not represent the actual performance of the consensus protocols in a production environment. Moreover, an experiment with chaos engineering indicates that if two different blockchain platforms use the same blockchain algorithm or protocol, we should not assume they will have similar performance. Therefore, It is also essential to consider the role of platform architecture and how the protocols are engineered in a given platform. "
