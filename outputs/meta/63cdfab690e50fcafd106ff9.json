  "abstract": "  In the PRIM project, we aim at giving people the power to create scenagrams (interaction scenarios between a human and digital devices) without the need to learn programming or to ask for computer scientists. In this project, software design follows an unconventional approach, far from classical codes, to embody human thinking (based on interactions) instead of computer logic (based on algorithms). The main idea rests on a new time representation using a PRIM-specific timeline instead of a standardized timeline. We evaluated acceptability and cognitive compatibility of this new timeline with 50 participants. Results are very promising. In this paper, we detail qualitative evaluation results about the interest of such software in the field of disability. "
