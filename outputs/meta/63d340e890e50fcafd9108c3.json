  "abstract": "  The stock market is characterized by a complex relationship between companies and the market. This study combines a sequential graph structure with attention mechanisms to learn global and local information within temporal time. Specifically, our proposed \"GAT-AGNN\" module compares model performance across multiple industries as well as within single industries. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting stock trends across multiple industries on Taiwan Stock datasets. "
