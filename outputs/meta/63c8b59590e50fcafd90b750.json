  "abstract": "  Computer Science for Future (CS4F) is an initiative in the Department of Computer Science at HAW Hamburg. The aim of the initiative is a paradigm shift in the discipline of computer science, thus establishing sustainability goals as a primary leitmotif for teaching and research. The focus is on teaching since the most promising multipliers are the students of a university. The change in teaching influences our research, the transfer to business and civil society as well as the change in our own institution. In this article, we present the initiative CS4F and reflect primarily on the role of students as amplifiers in the transformation process of computer science. "
