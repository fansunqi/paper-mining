  "abstract": "  We construct novel thread-modular analyses that track relational information for potentially overlapping clusters of global variables - given that they are protected by common mutexes. We provide a framework to systematically increase the precision of clustered relational analyses by splitting control locations based on abstractions of local traces. As one instance, we obtain an analysis of dynamic thread creation and joining. Interestingly, tracking less relational information for globals may result in higher precision. We consider the class of 2-decomposable domains that encompasses many weakly relational domains (e.g., Octagons). For these domains, we prove that maximal precision is attained already for clusters of globals of sizes at most 2. "
