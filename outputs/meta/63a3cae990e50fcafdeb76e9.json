  "title": "Template-Based Conjecturing for Automated Induction in Isabelle/HOL",
  "abstract": "  Proof by induction plays a central role in formal verification. However, its automation remains as a formidable challenge in Computer Science. To solve inductive problems, human engineers often have to provide auxiliary lemmas manually. We automate this laborious process with template-based conjecturing, a novel approach to generate auxiliary lemmas and use them to prove final goals. Our evaluation shows that our working prototype, TBC, achieved 40 percentage point improvement of success rates for problems at intermediate difficulty level. "
