  "title": "Reducing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks Using Relational\n  Embeddings",
  "abstract": "  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved a lot of success with graph-structured data. However, it is observed that the performance of GNNs does not improve (or even worsen) as the number of layers increases. This effect has known as over-smoothing, which means that the representations of the graph nodes of different classes would become indistinguishable when stacking multiple layers. In this work, we propose a new simple, and efficient method to alleviate the effect of the over-smoothing problem in GNNs by explicitly using relations between node embeddings. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that utilizing node embedding relations makes GNN models such as Graph Attention Network more robust to over-smoothing and achieves better performance with deeper GNNs. Our method can be used in combination with other methods to give the best performance. GNN applications are endless and depend on the user's objective and the type of data that they possess. Solving over-smoothing issues can potentially improve the performance of models on all these tasks. "
