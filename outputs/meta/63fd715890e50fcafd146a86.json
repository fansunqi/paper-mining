  "title": "Accuracy and Fidelity Comparison of Luna and DALL-E 2 Diffusion-Based\n  Image Generation Systems",
  "abstract": "  We qualitatively examine the accuracy and fidelity between two diffusion-based image generation systems, namely DALL-E 2 and Luna, which have massive differences in training datasets, algorithmic approaches, prompt resolvement, and output upscaling. The methodology used is a qualitative benchmark created by Saharia et al. and in our research we conclude that DALL-E 2 significantly edges Luna in both alignment and fidelity comparisons. "
