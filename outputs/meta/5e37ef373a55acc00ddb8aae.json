  "title": "Recursion, evolution and conscious self",
  "abstract": "  We introduce and study a learning theory which is roughly automatic, that is, it does not require but a minimum of initial programming, and is based on the potential computational phenomenon of self-reference, (i.e. the potential ability of an algorithm to have its program as an input).   The conclusions agree with scientific findings in both biology and neuroscience and provide a plethora of explanations both (in conjunction with Darwinism) about evolution, as well as for the functionality and learning capabilities of human brain, (most importantly), as we perceive them in ourselves.
