  "title": "Finding a Largest-Area Triangle in a Terrain in Near-Linear Time",
  "abstract": "  A terrain is an $x$-monotone polygon whose lower boundary is a single line segment. We present an algorithm to find in a terrain a triangle of largest area in $O(n \\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices defining the terrain. The best previous algorithm for this problem has a running time of $O(n^2)$. "
