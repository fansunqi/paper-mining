  "abstract": "  Recent advances in latent space dynamics model from pixels show promising progress in vision-based model predictive control (MPC). However, executing MPC in real time can be challenging due to its intensive computational cost in each timestep. We propose to introduce additional learning objectives to enforce that the learned latent space is proportional derivative controllable. In execution time, the simple PD-controller can be applied directly to the latent space encoded from pixels, to produce simple and effective control to systems with visual observations. We show that our method outperforms baseline methods to produce robust goal reaching and trajectory tracking in various environments. "
