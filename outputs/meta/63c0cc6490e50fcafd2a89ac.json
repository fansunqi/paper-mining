  "title": "Cache-Aided $K$-User Broadcast Channels with State Information at\n  Receivers",
  "abstract": "  We study a $K$-user coded-caching broadcast problem in a joint source-channel coding framework. The transmitter observes a database of files that are being generated at a certain rate per channel use, and each user has a cache, which can store a fixed fraction of the generated symbols. In the delivery phase, the transmitter broadcasts a message so that the users can decode their desired files using the received signal and their cache content. The communication between the transmitter and the receivers happens over a (deterministic) \\textit{time-varying} erasure broadcast channel, and the channel state information is only available to the users. We characterize the maximum achievable source rate for the $2$-user and the degraded $K$-user problems. We provide an upper bound for any caching strategy's achievable source rates. Finally, we present a linear programming formulation to show that the upper bound is not a sharp characterization. Closing the gap between the achievable rate and the optimum rate remains open. "
