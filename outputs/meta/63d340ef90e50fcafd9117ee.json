  "title": "BillionCOV: An Enriched Billion-scale Collection of COVID-19 tweets for\n  Efficient Hydration",
  "abstract": "  The COVID-19 pandemic introduced new norms such as social distancing, face masks, quarantine, lockdowns, travel restrictions, work/study from home, and business closures, to name a few. The pandemic's seriousness made people vocal on social media, especially on microblogs such as Twitter. Researchers have been collecting and sharing large-scale datasets of COVID-19 tweets since the early days of the outbreak. Sharing raw Twitter data with third parties is restricted; users need to hydrate tweet identifiers in a public dataset to re-create the dataset locally. Large-scale datasets that include original tweets, retweets, quotes, and replies have tweets in billions which takes months to hydrate. The existing datasets carry issues related to proportion and redundancy. We report that more than 500 million tweet identifiers point to deleted or protected tweets. In order to address these issues, this paper introduces an enriched global billion-scale English-language COVID-19 tweets dataset, BillionCOV, that contains 1.4 billion tweets originating from 240 countries and territories between October 2019 and April 2022. Importantly, BillionCOV facilitates researchers to filter tweet identifiers for efficient hydration. This paper discusses associated methods to fetch raw Twitter data for a set of tweet identifiers, presents multiple tweets' distributions to provide an overview of BillionCOV, and finally, reviews the dataset's potential use cases.
