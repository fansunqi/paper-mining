  "abstract": "  Sampling rate offsets (SROs) between devices in a heterogeneous wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) can hinder the ability of distributed adaptive algorithms to perform as intended when they rely on coherent signal processing. In this paper, we present an SRO estimation and compensation method to allow the deployment of the distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) algorithm in WASNs composed of asynchronous devices. The signals available at each node are first utilised in a coherence-drift-based method to blindly estimate SROs which are then compensated for via phase shifts in the frequency domain. A modification of the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) implementation of DANSE is introduced to account for SRO-induced full-sample drifts, permitting per-sample signal transmission via an approximation of the WOLA process as a time-domain convolution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in the context of distributed noise reduction for the estimation of a target speech signal in an asynchronous WASN. "
