  "title": "CSwin2SR: Circular Swin2SR for Compressed Image Super-Resolution",
  "abstract": "  Closed-loop negative feedback mechanism is extensively utilized in automatic control systems and brings about extraordinary dynamic and static performance. In order to further improve the reconstruction capability of current methods of compressed image super-resolution, a circular Swin2SR (CSwin2SR) approach is proposed. The CSwin2SR contains a serial Swin2SR for initial super-resolution reestablishment and circular Swin2SR for enhanced super-resolution reestablishment. Simulated experimental results show that the proposed CSwin2SR dramatically outperforms the classical Swin2SR in the capacity of super-resolution recovery. On DIV2K test and valid datasets, the average increment of PSNR is greater than 0.18 dB and the related average increment of SSIM is greater than 0.01. "
