  "abstract": "  Visual recognition of materials and their states is essential for understanding most aspects of the world, from determining whether food is cooked, metal is rusted, or a chemical reaction has occurred. However, current image recognition methods are limited to specific classes and properties and can't handle the vast number of material states in the world. To address this, we present MatSim: the first dataset and benchmark for computer vision-based recognition of similarities and transitions between materials and textures, focusing on identifying any material under any conditions using one or a few examples. The dataset contains synthetic and natural images. The synthetic images were rendered using giant collections of textures, objects, and environments generated by computer graphics artists. We use mixtures and gradual transitions between materials to allow the system to learn cases with smooth transitions between states (like gradually cooked food). We also render images with materials inside transparent containers to support beverage and chemistry lab use cases. We use this dataset to train a siamese net that identifies the same material in different objects, mixtures, and environments. The descriptor generated by this net can be used to identify the states of materials and their subclasses using a single image. We also present the first few-shot material recognition benchmark with images from a wide range of fields, including the state of foods and drinks, types of grounds, and many other use cases. We show that a net trained on the MatSim synthetic dataset outperforms state-of-the-art models like Clip on the benchmark and also achieves good results on other unsupervised material classification tasks.
