  "abstract": "  Computational task offloading based on edge computing can deal with the performance bottleneck of traditional cloud-based systems for Internet of things (IoT). To further optimize computing efficiency and resource allocation, collaborative offloading has been put forward to enable the offloading from edge devices to IoT terminal devices. However, there still lack incentive mechanisms to encourage participants to take over tasks from others. To counter this situation, this paper proposes a distributed computational resource trading strategy addressing multiple preferences of IoT users. Unlike most existing works, the objective of our trading strategy comprehensively considers different satisfaction degrees with task delay, energy consumption, price, and user reputation of both requesters and collaborators. The system design uses blockchain to enhance the decentralization, security, and automation. Compared with the trading method based on classical double auction matching mechanism, our trading strategy has more tasks offloaded and executed, and the trading results are friendlier to collaborators with good reputation.
