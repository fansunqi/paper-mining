  "title": "Separating the edges of a graph by a linear number of paths",
  "abstract": "  Recently, Letzter proved that any graph of order $n$ contains a collection $\\mathcal{P}$ of $O(n\\log^\\star n)$ paths with the following property: for all distinct edges $e$ and $f$ there exists a path in $\\mathcal{P}$ which contains $e$ but not $f$. We improve this upper bound to $19 n$, thus answering a question of Katona and confirming a conjecture independently posed by Balogh, Csaba, Martin, and Pluh\\'ar and by Falgas-Ravry, Kittipassorn, Kor\\'andi, Letzter, and Narayanan. Our proof is elementary and self-contained. "
