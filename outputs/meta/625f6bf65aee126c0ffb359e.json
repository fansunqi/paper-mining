  "title": "PoseCoach: A Customizable Analysis and Visualization System for\n  Video-based Running Coaching",
  "abstract": "  Videos are an accessible form of media for analyzing sports postures and providing feedback to athletes. Existing sport-specific systems embed bespoke human pose attributes and thus can be hard to scale for new attributes, especially for users without programming experiences. Some systems retain scalability by directly showing the differences between two poses, but they might not clearly visualize the key differences that viewers would like to pursue. Besides, video-based coaching systems often present feedback on the correctness of poses by augmenting videos with visual markers or reference poses. However, previewing and augmenting videos limit the analysis and visualization of human poses due to the fixed viewpoints in videos, which confine the observation of captured human movements and cause ambiguity in the augmented feedback. To address these issues, we study customizable human pose data analysis and visualization in the context of running pose attributes, such as joint angles and step distances. Based on existing literature and a formative study, we have designed and implemented a system, PoseCoach, to provide feedback on running poses for amateurs by comparing the running poses between a novice and an expert. PoseCoach adopts a customizable data analysis model to allow users' controllability in defining pose attributes of their interests through our interface. To avoid the influence of viewpoint differences and provide intuitive feedback, PoseCoach visualizes the pose differences as part-based 3D animations on a human model to imitate the demonstration of a human coach. We conduct a user study to verify our design components and conduct expert interviews to evaluate the usefulness of the system. "
