  "abstract": "  The top tree data structure is an important and fundamental tool in dynamic graph algorithms. Top trees have existed for decades, and today serve as an ingredient in many state-of-the-art algorithms for dynamic graphs. In this work, we give a new direct proof of the existence of top trees, facilitating simpler and more direct implementations of top trees, based on ideas from splay trees. This result hinges on new insights into the structure of top trees, and in particular the structure of each root path in a top tree. "
