  "title": "Pistol: Pupil Invisible Supportive Tool to extract Pupil, Iris, Eye\n  Opening, Eye Movements, Pupil and Iris Gaze Vector, and 2D as well as 3D Gaze",
  "abstract": "  This paper describes a feature extraction and gaze estimation software, named \\textit{Pistol} that can be used with Pupil Invisible projects and other eye trackers in the future. In offline mode, our software extracts multiple features from the eye including, the pupil and iris ellipse, eye aperture, pupil vector, iris vector, eye movement types from pupil and iris velocities, marker detection, marker distance, 2D gaze estimation for the pupil center, iris center, pupil vector, and iris vector using Levenberg Marquart fitting and neural networks. The gaze signal is computed in 2D for each eye and each feature separately and for both eyes in 3D also for each feature separately. We hope this software helps other researchers to extract state-of-the-art features for their research out of their recordings.
