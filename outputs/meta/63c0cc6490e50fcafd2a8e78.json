  "abstract": "  We have developed a set of Python applications that use large language models to identify and analyze data from social media platforms relevant to a population of interest. Our pipeline begins with using OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate potential keywords for identifying relevant text content from the target population. The keywords are then validated, and the content downloaded and analyzed using GPT-3 embedding and manifold reduction. Corpora are then created to fine-tune GPT-2 models to explore latent information via prompt-based queries. These tools allow researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights into population subgroups online.   Source code at https://github.com/pgfeldman/KeywordExplorer "
