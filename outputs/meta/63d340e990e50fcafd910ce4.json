  "abstract": "  For a mobile robot, we present an approach to recognize scenes in arrangements of objects distributed over cluttered environments. Recognition is made possible by letting the robot alternately search for objects and assign found objects to scenes. Our scene model \"Implicit Shape Model (ISM) trees\" allows us to solve these two tasks together. For the ISM trees, this article presents novel algorithms for recognizing scenes and predicting the poses of searched objects. We define scenes as sets of objects, where some objects are connected by 3-D spatial relations. In previous work, we recognized scenes using single ISMs. However, these ISMs were prone to false positives. To address this problem, we introduced ISM trees, a hierarchical model that includes multiple ISMs. Through the recognition algorithm it contributes, this article ultimately enables the use of ISM trees in scene recognition. We intend to enable users to generate ISM trees from object arrangements demonstrated by humans. The lack of a suitable algorithm is overcome by the introduction of an ISM tree generation algorithm. In scene recognition, it is usually assumed that image data is already available. However, this is not always the case for robots. For this reason, we combined scene recognition and object search in previous work. However, we did not provide an efficient algorithm to link the two tasks. This article introduces such an algorithm that predicts the poses of searched objects with relations. Experiments show that our overall approach enables robots to find and recognize object arrangements that cannot be perceived from a single viewpoint. "
