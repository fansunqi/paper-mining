  "title": "A Comparison of Fundamental Methods for Iso-surface Extraction",
  "abstract": "  In this paper four fundamental methods for an iso-surface extraction are compared, based on cell decomposition to tetrahedra. The methods are compared both on mathematically generated data sets as well as on real data sets. The comparison using mathematical data is made from different points of view such as area approximation, volume approximation. On the other hand, the Hausdorff distance and root mean square are used to compare methods on real data sets. The presented comparison can be helpful when deciding among tested methods which one to choose, as well as when we need to compare a newly developed method with other existing approaches. "
