  "title": "Weighted and Branching Bisimilarities from Generalized Open Maps",
  "abstract": "  In the open map approach to bisimilarity, the paths and their runs in a given state-based system are the first-class citizens, and bisimilarity becomes a derived notion. While open maps were successfully used to model bisimilarity in non-deterministic systems, the approach fails to describe quantitative system equivalences such as probabilistic bisimilarity. In the present work, we see that this is indeed impossible and we thus generalize the notion of open maps to also accommodate weighted and probabilistic bisimilarity. Also, extending the notions of strong path and path bisimulations into this new framework, we show that branching bisimilarity can be captured by this extended theory and that it can be viewed as the history preserving restriction of weak bisimilarity.
