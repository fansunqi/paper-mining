  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a novel approach for solving a maintenance scheduling problem from the French electricity grid company RTE, as presented in the ROADEF 2020 challenge. Our approach combines constraint generation with a new family of cutting planes to address the nonconvexity of the problem. We provide mathematical proofs and separation algorithms for the cutting planes and study the practical impact of our approach on the challenge instances. This method is applicable to a wide range of problems involving the modeling of uncertainty, and is shown to improve results significantly on real-world instances. "
