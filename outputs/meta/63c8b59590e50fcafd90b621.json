  "title": "Surgical Aggregation: Federated Class-Heterogeneous Learning",
  "abstract": "The release of numerous chest x-ray datasets has spearheaded the development\nof deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, they have\nlimited interoperability due to class-heterogeneity \u2013 a result of inconsistent\nlabeling schemes and partial annotations. Therefore, it is challenging to\nleverage these datasets in aggregate to train models with a complete\nrepresentation of abnormalities that may occur within the thorax. In this work,\nwe propose surgical aggregation, a federated learning framework for aggregating\nknowledge from class-heterogeneous datasets and learn a model that can\nsimultaneously predict the presence of all disease labels present across the\ndatasets. We evaluate our method using simulated and real-world\nclass-heterogeneous datasets across both independent and identically\ndistributed (iid) and non-iid settings. Our results show that surgical\naggregation outperforms current methods, has better generalizability, and is a\ncrucial first step towards tackling class-heterogeneity in federated learning\nto facilitate the development of clinically-useful models using previously\nnon-interoperable chest x-ray datasets."
