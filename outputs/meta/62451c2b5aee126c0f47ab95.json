  "abstract": "  Graph convexity has been used as an important tool to better understand the structure of classes of graphs. Many studies are devoted to determine if a graph equipped with a convexity is a {\\em convex geometry}. In this work we survey results on characterizations of well-known classes of graphs via convex geometries. We also give some contributions to this subject. "
