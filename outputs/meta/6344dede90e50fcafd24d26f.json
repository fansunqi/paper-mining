  "abstract": "  Should deep learning models be trained to analyze human performance art? To help answer this question, we explore an application of deep neural networks to synthesize artistic human motion. Problem tasks in human motion synthesis can include predicting the motions of humans in-the-wild, as well as generating new sequences of motions based on said predictions. We will discuss the potential of a less traditional application, where learning models are applied to predicting dance movements. There have been notable, recent efforts to analyze dance movements in a computational light, such as the Everybody Dance Now (EDN) learning model and a Cal Poly master's thesis, Take The Lead (TTL). We have effectively combined these two works along with our own deep neural network to produce a new system for dance motion prediction, image-to-image translation, and video generation. "
