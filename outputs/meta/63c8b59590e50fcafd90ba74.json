  "title": "A Note on the $k$-colored Crossing Ratio of Dense Geometric Graphs",
  "abstract": "  A \\emph{geometric graph} is a graph whose vertex set is a set of points in general position in the plane, and its edges are straight line segments joining these points. We show that for every integer $k \\ge 2$, there exists a constat $c>0$ such that the following holds. The edges of every dense geometric graph can be colored with $k$ colors, such that the number of pairs of edges of the same color that cross is at most $(1/k-c)$ times the total number of pairs of edges that cross. The case when $k=2$ and $G$ is a complete geometric graph, was proved by Aichholzer et al.[\\emph{GD} 2019]. "
