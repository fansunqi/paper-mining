  "abstract": "  To mitigate ATFM delay, different approaches have been proposed so far which can be categorized into strategic and tactical domains. The strategical techniques mainly concern airport slot allocation and for the tactical domain, the ATFM function has several solutions available that range from the ground and air holding to rerouting actions, which have not gained significant efficiency in ATFM delay mitigation due to the fact that delays become apparent only on the tactical level when the strategic flight plan has been filled already. To tackle and address this problem there is a need for an algorithm that can synchronize strategical and tactical schedules. To fill this gap, in this paper the concept of fair buffer scheduling is proposed which can potentially contribute to strategical and tactical operations synchronization that would result in ATFM delay mitigation by increasing the system's robustness. The objective is to obtain an optimum fair and efficient buffer choice that mitigates ATFM delay and increases the stakeholders' welfare. Each appropriate and efficient approach requires a comprehensive understanding of the strategical buffer scheduling. This study presents a delay cost and flight buffer model that could be used for generating optimal buffer times to be considered as the initial population for the optimization problem to investigate the viability of employing fairness measures to obtain schedules with different trade-offs between cost, delay, and fairness.
