  "title": "Automatic Sound Event Detection and Classification of Great Ape Calls\n  Using Neural Networks",
  "abstract": "  We present a novel approach to automatically detect and classify great ape calls from continuous raw audio recordings collected during field research. Our method leverages deep pretrained and sequential neural networks, including wav2vec 2.0 and LSTM, and is validated on three data sets from three different great ape lineages (orangutans, chimpanzees, and bonobos). The recordings were collected by different researchers and include different annotation schemes, which our pipeline preprocesses and trains in a uniform fashion. Our results for call detection and classification attain high accuracy. Our method is aimed to be generalizable to other animal species, and more generally, sound event detection tasks. To foster future research, we make our pipeline and methods publicly available. "
