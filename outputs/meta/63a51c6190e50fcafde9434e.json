  "abstract": "  The complexity of the elliptic curve method of factorization (ECM) is proven under the celebrated conjecture of existence of smooth numbers in short intervals. In this work we tackle a different version of ECM which is actually much more studied and implemented, especially because it allows us to use ECM-friendly curves. In the case of curves with complex multiplication (CM) we replace the heuristics by rigorous results conditional to the Elliott-Halberstam (EH) conjecture. The proven results mirror recent theorems concerning the number of primes p such thar p -- 1 is smooth. To each CM elliptic curve we associate a value which measures how ECM-friendly it is. In the general case we explore consequences of a statement which translated EH in the case of elliptic curves. "
