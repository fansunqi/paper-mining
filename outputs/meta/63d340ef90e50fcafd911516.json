  "title": "MAG$\\pi$: Types for Failure-Prone Communication",
  "abstract": "  Multiparty Session Types (MPST) are a typing discipline for communication-centric systems, guaranteeing communication safety, deadlock freedom and protocol compliance. Several works have emerged which model failures and introduce fault-tolerance techniques. However, such works often make assumptions on the underlying network, e.g., TCP-based communication where messages are guaranteed to be delivered; or adopt centralised reliable nodes and an ad-hoc notion of reliability; or only address a single kind of failure, such as node crash failures. In this work, we develop MAG$\\pi$ -- a Multiparty, Asynchronous and Generalised $\\pi$-calculus, which is the first language and type system to accommodate in unison: (i) the widest range of non-Byzantine faults, including message loss, delays and reordering; crash failures and link failures; and network partitioning; (ii) a novel and most general notion of reliability, taking into account the viewpoint of each participant in the protocol; (iii) a spectrum of network assumptions from the lowest UDP-based network programming to the TCP-based application level. We prove subject reduction and session fidelity; process properties (deadlock freedom, termination, etc.); failure-handling safety and reliability adherence. "
