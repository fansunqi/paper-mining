  "abstract": "  Organizations concerned about digital or computer forensics capability which establishes procedures and records to support a prosecution for computer crimes could benefit from implementing an ISO 27001: 2013-compliant (ISMS Information Security Management System). A certified ISMS adds credibility to information gathered in a digital forensics investigation; certification shows that the organization has an outsider which verifies that the correct procedures are in place and being followed. A certified ISMS is a valuable tool either when prosecuting an intruder or when a customer or other stakeholder seeks damages against the organization. SOC (Security Operation Center) as an organization or a security unit which handles a large volume of information requires a management complement, where ISMS would be a good choice. This idea will help finding solutions for problems related to digital forensics for non-cloud and cloud digital forensics, including Problems associated with the absence of standardization amongst different CSPs (Cloud service providers).
