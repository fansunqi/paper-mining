  "abstract": "  We investigate partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with cost functions regularized by entropy terms describing state, observation, and control uncertainty. Standard POMDP techniques are shown to offer bounded-error solutions to these entropy-regularized POMDPs, with exact solutions possible when the regularization involves the joint entropy of the state, observation, and control trajectories. Our joint-entropy result is particularly surprising since it constitutes a novel, tractable formulation of active state estimation. "
