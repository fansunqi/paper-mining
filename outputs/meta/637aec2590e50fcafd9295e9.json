  "title": "CRONOS: Colorization and Contrastive Learning for Device-Free NLoS Human\n  Presence Detection using Wi-Fi CSI",
  "abstract": "  In recent years, the demand for pervasive smart services and applications has increased rapidly. Device-free human detection through sensors or cameras has been widely adopted, but it comes with privacy issues as well as misdetection for motionless people. To address these drawbacks, channel state information (CSI) captured from commercialized Wi-Fi devices provides rich signal features for accurate detection. However, existing systems suffer from inaccurate classification under a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and stationary scenario, such as when a person is standing still in a room corner. In this work, we propose a system called CRONOS (Colorization and Contrastive Learning Enhanced NLoS Human Presence Detection), which generates dynamic recurrence plots (RPs) and color-coded CSI ratios to distinguish mobile people from vacancy in a room, respectively. We also incorporate supervised contrastive learning to retrieve substantial representations, where consultation loss is formulated to differentiate the representative distances between dynamic and stationary cases. Furthermore, we propose a self-switched static feature enhanced classifier (S3FEC) to determine the utilization of either RPs or color-coded CSI ratios. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CRONOS outperforms existing systems that apply machine learning, non-learning based methods, as well as non-CSI based features in open literature. CRONOS achieves the highest presence detection accuracy in vacancy, mobility, line-of-sight (LoS), and NLoS scenarios. "
