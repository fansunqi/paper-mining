  "abstract": "  The familiar second derivative test for convexity, combined with resolvent calculus, is shown to yield a useful tool for the study of convex matrix-valued functions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a number of theorems in this field. These include convexity principles which play an essential role in the Lieb-Ruskai proof of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy. "
