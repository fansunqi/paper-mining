  "abstract": "  Let $L_{>\\lambda}(\\mathcal{A})$ and $L_{\\geq\\lambda}(\\mathcal{A})$ be the languages recognized by {\\em measure many 1-way quantum finite automata (MM-QFA)} (or,{\\em enhanced 1-way quantum finite automata(EQFA)}) $\\mathcal{A}$ with strict and non-strict cut-point $\\lambda$, respectively. We consider the language equivalence problem and show the following   1. both strict and non-strict language equivalence are undecidable;   2. we provide an another proof of the undecidability of non-strict and strict emptiness of MM-QFA and EQFA, and then reducing the language equivalence problem to emptiness problem;   3. lastly, we obtain some other properties which can be derived from the above results.
