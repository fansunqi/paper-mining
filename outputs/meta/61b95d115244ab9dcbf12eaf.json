  "title": "New Binary Quantum Codes Constructed from Quasi-Cyclic Codes",
  "abstract": "  It is well known that quantum codes can be constructed by means of classical symplectic dual-containing codes. This paper considers a family of two-generator quasi-cyclic codes and derives sufficient conditions for these codes to be symplectic dual-containing. Then, a new method for constructing binary quantum codes using symplectic dual-containing codes is proposed. As an application, we construct 8 binary quantum codes that exceed the best-known results. Further, another 36 new binary quantum codes are obtained by propagation rules, all of which improve the lower bound on the minimum distances. "
