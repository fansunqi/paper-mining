  "title": "Robophysical modeling of spacetime dynamics",
  "abstract": "  Systems consisting of spheres rolling on elastic membranes have been used as educational tools to introduce a core conceptual idea of General Relativity (GR): how curvature guides the movement of matter. However, previous studies have revealed that such schemes cannot accurately represent relativistic dynamics in the laboratory. Dissipative forces cause the initially GR-like dynamics to be transient and consequently restrict experimental study to only the beginnings of trajectories; dominance of Earth's gravity forbids the difference between spatial and temporal spacetime curvatures. Here by developing a mapping between dynamics of a wheeled vehicle on a spandex membrane, we demonstrate that an active object that can prescribe its speed can not only obtain steady-state orbits, but also use the additional parameters such as speed to tune the orbits towards relativistic dynamics. Our mapping demonstrates how activity mixes space and time in a metric, shows how active particles do not necessarily follow geodesics in the real space but instead follow geodesics in a fiducial spacetime. The mapping further reveals how parameters such as the membrane elasticity and instantaneous speed allow programming a desired spacetime such as the Schwarzschild metric near a non-rotating black hole. Our mapping and framework point the way to the possibility to create a robophysical analog gravity system in the laboratory at low cost and provide insights into active matter in deformable environments and robot exploration in complex landscapes.
