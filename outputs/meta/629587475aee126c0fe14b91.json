  "abstract": "  Existing clustering methods are based on a single granularity of information, such as the distance and density of each data. This most fine-grained based approach is usually inefficient and susceptible to noise. Inspired by adaptive process of granular-ball division and differentiation, we present a novel clustering approach that retains the speed and efficiency of K-means clustering while out-performing time-tested density clustering approaches widely used in industry today. Our simple, robust, adaptive granular-ball clustering method can efficiently recognize clusters with unknown and complex shapes without the use of extra parameters. Moreover, the proposed method provides an efficient, adaptive way to depict the world, and will promote the research and development of adaptive and efficient AI technologies, especially density computing models, and improve the efficiency of many existing clustering methods.
