  "title": "Towards User-Centric Guidelines for Chatbot Conversational Design",
  "abstract": "  The conversational nature of chatbots poses challenges to designers since their development is different from other software and requires investigating new practices in the context of human-AI interaction and their impact on user experience. Therefore, this work aims to unveil chatbot conversational practices alongside their impacts on users to build a web guide to support designers while conceiving conversations for chatbots. We have carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify linguist, visual, and interactive elements used in chatbot conversational design. The SLR resulted in 40 selected studies that were reviewed and coded into a set of conversational guidelines that were evaluated through a survey. Respondents strongly agreed that applying the proposed guidelines in chatbot development would induce greater user satisfaction and user engagement and the guide is usable, flexible, clear, and understandable, making it a great ally in building chatbots with an improved user experience.
