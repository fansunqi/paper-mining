  "title": "A Neural Network Approach for Selecting Track-like Events in\n  Fluorescence Telescope Data",
  "abstract": "  In 2016-2017, TUS, the world's first experiment for testing the possibility of registering ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by their fluorescent radiation in the night atmosphere of Earth was carried out. Since 2019, the Russian-Italian fluorescence telescope (FT) Mini-EUSO (\"UV Atmosphere\") has been operating on the ISS. The stratospheric experiment EUSO-SPB2, which will employ an FT for registering UHECRs, is planned for 2023. We show how a simple convolutional neural network can be effectively used to find track-like events in the variety of data obtained with such instruments. "
