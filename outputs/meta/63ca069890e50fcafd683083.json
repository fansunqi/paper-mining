  "abstract": "  Blockchain is a revolutionary technology, and its growth started in various industries (such as IT, education, business, banking, and many others) to capitalize on it. Currently, in higher education institutions (HEIs) adoption of blockchain education needs to be improved in the academic programs and curriculums. In addition, HEIs must make many intense changes in the teaching and learning methods to educate learners about blockchain technology and its applications to meet the current industry workforce demand. Due to a lack of academic programs and courses, students nowadays rely on online resources and pay non-academic organizations a high fee. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of blockchain education's current state of the art by reviewing the different academic programs and industry workforce demand. In addition, blockchain application trends which include market growth and demands are discussed. Moreover, the blockchain career scope for different disciplines of students is examined. "
