  "abstract": "  This paper presents a new multi-layered algorithm for motion planning under motion and sensing uncertainties for Linear Temporal Logic specifications. We propose a technique to guide a sampling-based search tree in the combined task and belief space using trajectories from a simplified model of the system, to make the problem computationally tractable. Our method eliminates the need to construct fine and accurate finite abstractions. We prove correctness and probabilistic completeness of our algorithm, and illustrate the benefits of our approach on several case studies. Our results show that guidance with a simplified belief space model allows for significant speed-up in planning for complex specifications. "
