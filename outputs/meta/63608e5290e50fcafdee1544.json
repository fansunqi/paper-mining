  "abstract": "  We present a tool for verification of hybrid systems expressed in the sequential fragment of HCSP (Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes). The tool permits annotating HCSP programs with pre- and postconditions, invariants, and proof rules for reasoning about ordinary differential equations. Verification conditions are generated from the annotations following the rules of hybrid Hoare logic. We designed labeling and highlighting mechanisms to distinguish and visualize different verification conditions. The tool is implemented in Python and has a web-based user interface. We evaluated the effectiveness of the tool on translations of Simulink/Stateflow models and on KeYmaera X benchmarks. "
