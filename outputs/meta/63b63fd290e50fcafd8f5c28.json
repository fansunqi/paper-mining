  "abstract": "  In this article, we focus on the importance of open research information as the foundation for transparent and responsible research assessment and discovery of research outputs. We introduce work in which we support the open research information commons by enabling, in particular, independent and small Open Access journals to provide metadata to several open data hubs (Open Citations, Wikidata, Open Research Knowledge Graph). In this context, we present The OPTIMETA Way, a means to integrate metadata collection, enrichment, and distribution in an effective and quality-ensured way that enables uptake even amongst small scholar-led publication venues. We have designed an implementation strategy for this approach in the form of two plugins for the most widely used journal publishing software, Open Journal Systems (OJS). These plugins collect, enrich, and automatically deliver citation metadata and spatio-temporal metadata for articles. Our contribution to research assessment and discovery with linked open bibliographic data is threefold. First, we enlarge the open research information data pool by advocating for the collection of enriched, user-validated metadata at the time of publication through open APIs. Second, we integrate data platforms and journals currently not included in the standard scientometric practices because of their language or lack of support from big publishing houses. Third, we allow new use cases based on location and temporal metadata that go beyond commonly used discovery features, specifically, the assessment of research activities using spatial coverage and new transdisciplinary connections between research outputs.
