  "abstract": "  We derive simplified sphere-packing and Gilbert--Varshamov bounds for codes in the sum-rank metric, which can be computed more efficiently than previous ones. They give rise to asymptotic bounds that cover the asymptotic setting that has not yet been considered in the literature: families of sum-rank-metric codes whose block size grows in the code length. We also provide two genericity results: we show that random linear codes achieve almost the sum-rank-metric Gilbert--Varshamov bound with high probability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on the probability that a random linear code attains the sum-rank-metric Singleton bound, showing that for large enough extension fields, almost all linear codes achieve it.
