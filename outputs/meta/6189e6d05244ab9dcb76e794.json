  "title": "The eXtreme Mesh deformation approach (X-MESH) for the Stefan\n  phase-change model",
  "abstract": "  The eXtreme Mesh deformation approach (X-MESH) is a new paradigm to follow sharp interfaces without remeshing and without changing the mesh topology. Even though the mesh does not change its topology, it can follow interfaces that do change their topology (nucleation, coalescence, splitting). To make this possible, the key X-MESH idea is to allow elements to reach zero measure. This permits interface relaying between nodes as well as interface annihilation and seeding in a time continuous manner. The paper targets the Stefan phase change model in which the interface (front) is at a given temperature. Several examples demonstrate the capability of the approach. "
