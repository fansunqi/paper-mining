  "abstract": "  Aiming at some problems existing in the current quality of service (QoS) mechanism of large-scale networks (i.e. poor scalability, coarse granularity for provided service levels, poor fairness between different service levels, and improving delay performance at the expense of sacrificing some resource utilization), the paper puts forward the idea and thoery of particle access. In the proposed particle access mechanism, the network first granulates the information flow (that is, the information flow is subdivided into information particles, each of which is given its corresponding attributes), and allocates access resources to the information particle group which is composed of all the information particles to be transmitted, so as to ensure that the occupied bandwidth resources is minimized on the premise of meeting the delay requirements of each information particle. Moreover, in the paper, the concepts of both information particle and information particle group are defined; Basic properties of the minimum reachable access bandwidth of an information particle group are analyzed; The influences of time attribute and attribute of bearing capacity of an information particle group on the minimum reachable access bandwidth are analyzed; Finally, an effective method for the calculation of the minimum reachable access bandwidth of an information particle group is given, and a particle access algorithm based on dynamically adjusting the minimum reachable access bandwidth is proposed. The research of the paper pave a new way for further improving QoS mechanisms of large-scale networks, and lay the corresponding theoretical foundation. "
