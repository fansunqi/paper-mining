  "abstract": "  Student motivation is a key research agenda due to the necessity of both postcolonial education reform and youth job-market adaptation in ongoing fourth industrial revolution. Post-communism era teachers are prompted to analyze student ethnicity information such as background, origin with the aim of providing better education. With the proliferation of smart-device data, ever-increasing demand for distance learning platforms and various survey results of virtual learning, we are fortunate to have some access to student engagement data. In this research, we are motivated to address the following questions: can we predict student engagement from ethnographic information when we have limited labeled knowledge? If the answer is yes, can we tell which features are most influential in ethnographic engagement learning? In this context, we have proposed a deep neural network based transfer learning algorithm ETHNO-DAANN with adversarial adaptation for ethnographic engagement prediction. We conduct a survey among participants about ethnicity-based student motivation to figure out the most influential feature helpful in final prediction. Thus, our research stands as a general solution for ethnographic motivation parameter estimation in case of limited labeled data. "
