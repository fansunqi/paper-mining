  "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of safely coordinating a team of sensor-equipped robots to reduce uncertainty about a dynamical process, where the objective trades off information gain and energy cost. Optimizing this trade-off is desirable, but leads to a non-monotone objective function in the set of robot trajectories. Therefore, common multi-robot planners based on coordinate descent lose their performance guarantees. Furthermore, methods that handle non-monotonicity lose their performance guarantees when subject to inter-robot collision avoidance constraints. As it is desirable to retain both the performance guarantee and safety guarantee, this work proposes a hierarchical approach with a distributed planner that uses local search with a worst-case performance guarantees and a decentralized controller based on control barrier functions that ensures safety and encourages timely arrival at sensing locations. Via extensive simulations, hardware-in-the-loop tests and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a better trade-off between sensing and energy cost than coordinate-descent-based algorithms.
