  "title": "Algorithms for Massive Data -- Lecture Notes",
  "abstract": "  These are the lecture notes for the course CM0622 - Algorithms for Massive Data, Ca' Foscari University of Venice. The goal of this course is to introduce algorithmic techniques for dealing with massive data: data so large that it does not fit in the computer's memory. Broadly speaking, there are two main solutions to deal with massive data: (lossless) compressed data structures and (lossy) data sketches. These notes cover the latter topic: probabilistic filters, sketching under various metrics, Locality Sensitive Hashing, nearest neighbour search, algorithms on streams (pattern matching, counting). "
