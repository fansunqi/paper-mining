  "abstract": "  Identifying differences between groups is one of the most important knowledge discovery problems. The procedure, also known as contrast sets mining, is applied in a wide range of areas like medicine, industry, or economics.   In the paper we present RuleKit-CS, an algorithm for contrast set mining based on separate and conquer - a well established heuristic for decision rule induction. Multiple passes accompanied with an attribute penalization scheme provide contrast sets describing same examples with different attributes, distinguishing presented approach from the standard separate and conquer. The algorithm was also generalized for regression and survival data allowing identification of contrast sets whose label attribute/survival prognosis is consistent with the label/prognosis for the predefined contrast groups. This feature, not provided by the existing approaches, further extends the usability of RuleKit-CS.   Experiments on over 130 data sets from various areas and detailed analysis of selected cases confirmed RuleKit-CS to be a useful tool for discovering differences between defined groups. The algorithm was implemented as a part of the RuleKit suite available at GitHub under GNU AGPL 3 licence (https://github.com/adaa-polsl/RuleKit).   Keywords: contrast sets, separate and conquer, regression, survival "
