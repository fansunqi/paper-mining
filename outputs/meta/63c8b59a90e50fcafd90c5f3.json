  "title": "Active learning for medical image segmentation with stochastic batches",
  "abstract": "  The performance of learning-based algorithms improves with the amount of labelled data used for training. Yet, manually annotating data can be tedious and expensive, especially in medical image segmentation. To reduce manual labelling, active learning (AL) targets the most informative samples from the unlabelled set to annotate and add to the labelled training set. On one hand, most active learning works have focused on the classification or limited segmentation of natural images, despite active learning being highly desirable in the difficult task of medical image segmentation. On the other hand, uncertainty-based AL approaches notoriously offer sub-optimal batch-query strategies, while diversity-based methods tend to be computationally expensive. Over and above methodological hurdles, random sampling has proven an extremely difficult baseline to outperform when varying learning and sampling conditions. This work aims to take advantage of the diversity and speed offered by random sampling to improve the selection of uncertainty-based AL methods for segmenting medical images. More specifically, we propose to compute uncertainty at the level of batches instead of samples through an original use of stochastic batches during sampling in AL. Exhaustive experiments on medical image segmentation, with an illustration on MRI prostate imaging, show that the benefits of stochastic batches during sample selection are robust to a variety of changes in the training and sampling procedures.
