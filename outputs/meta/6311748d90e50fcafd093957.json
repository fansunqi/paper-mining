  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present Tetris, a new task of Goal-Oriented Script Completion. Unlike previous work, it considers a more realistic and general setting, where the input includes not only the goal but also additional user context, including preferences and history. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, which uses two techniques to improve performance: (1) concept prompting, and (2) script-oriented contrastive learning that addresses step repetition and hallucination problems. On our WikiHow-based dataset, we find that both methods improve performance. The dataset, repository, and models will be publicly available to facilitate further research on this new task. "
