  "title": "Should Users Trust Their Android Devices? A Scoring System for Assessing\n  Security and Privacy Risks of Pre-Installed Applications",
  "abstract": "  Android devices are equipped with many pre-installed applications which have the capability of tracking and monitoring users. Although applications coming pre-installed pose a great danger to user security and privacy, they have received little attention so far among researchers in the field. In this study, we collect a dataset comprising such applications and make it publicly available. Using this dataset, we analyze tracker SDKs, manifest files and the use of cloud services and report our results. We also conduct a user survey to understand concerns and perceptions of users. Last but not least, we present a risk scoring system which assigns scores for smart phones consolidating our findings based on carefully weighted criteria. With this scoring system, users could give their own trust decisions based on the available concise information about the security and privacy impacts of applications pre-installed on their Android devices.
