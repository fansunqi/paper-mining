  "abstract": "  In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to music generation systems with promising results. However, one of the main challenges in this field has been the lack of annotated datasets, making it difficult for models to learn musical forms in compositions. To address this issue, we present TunesFormer, a Transformer-based melody generation system that is trained on a large dataset of 285,449 ABC tunes. By utilizing specific symbols commonly found in ABC notation to indicate section boundaries, TunesFormer can understand and generate melodies with given musical forms based on control codes. Our objective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the control codes in achieving controlled musical forms, and subjective experiments show that the generated melodies are of comparable quality to human compositions. Our results also provide insights into the optimal placement of control codes and their impact on the generated melodies. TunesFormer presents a promising approach for generating melodies with desired musical forms through the use of deep learning techniques. "
