  "abstract": "  Social interaction begins with the other person's attention, but it is difficult for a d/Deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) person to notice the initial conversation cues. Wearable or visual devices have been proposed previously. However, these devices are cumbersome to wear or must stay within the DHH person's vision. In this study, we have proposed SHITARA, a novel accessibility method with air vortex rings that provides a non-contact haptic cue for a DHH person. We have developed a proof-of-concept device and determined the air vortex ring's accuracy, noticeability and comfortability when it hits a DHH's hair. Though strength, accuracy, and noticeability of air vortex rings decrease as the distance between the air vortex ring generator and the user increases, we have demonstrated that the air vortex ring is noticeable up to 2.5 meters away. Moreover, the optimum strength is found for each distance from a DHH. "
