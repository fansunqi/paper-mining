  "title": "Ontology-based Solution for Building an Intelligent Searching System on\n  Traffic Law Documents",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, an ontology-based approach is used to organize the knowledge base of legal documents in road traffic law. This knowledge model is built by the improvement of ontology Rela-model. In addition, several searching problems on traffic law are proposed and solved based on the legal knowledge base. The intelligent search system on Vietnam road traffic law is constructed by applying the method. The searching system can help users to find concepts and definitions in road traffic law. Moreover, it can also determine penalties and fines for violations in the traffic. The experiment results show that the system is efficient for users' typical searching and is emerging for usage in the real-world. "
