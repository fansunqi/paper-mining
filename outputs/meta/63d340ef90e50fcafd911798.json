  "title": "A fuzzy logic-based stabilization system for a flying robot, with an\n  embedded energy harvester and a visual decision-making system",
  "abstract": "  \"Smart cities\" is the trendy rubric of modern urban projects that require new innovative ideas to attain the desired perfection in many fields to change our life for the better. In this context, a new innovative application will be presented here to investigate and continuously make the required maintenance of public roads by creating a flying robot for painting the partially erased parts of sidewalks' edges that are usually plated in two different colors; primarily black and white as we suppose here. The first contribution of this paper is developing a fuzzy-logic-based stabilization system for an octocopter serving as a liquids transporter that could be equipped with a robot arm. The second contribution consists of designing an embedded energy harvester for the flying robot to promote the management of available power sources. Finally, as suggested in this project, we present a complement heuristic study clarifying some main concepts that rely on a computer vision-based decision-making system. "
