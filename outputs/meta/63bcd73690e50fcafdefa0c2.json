  "abstract": "  Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are a kind of infection caused through the transmission of vectors generated by the bites of infected parasites, bacteria, and viruses, such as ticks, mosquitoes, triatomine bugs, blackflies, and sandflies. If these diseases are not properly treated within a reasonable time frame, the mortality rate may rise. In this work, we propose a set of ontologies that will help in the diagnosis and treatment of vector-borne diseases. For developing VBD's ontology, electronic health records taken from the Indian Health Records website, text data generated from Indian government medical mobile applications, and doctors' prescribed handwritten notes of patients are used as input. This data is then converted into correct text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a spelling checker after pre-processing. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applied for entity extraction from text data for making Resource Description Framework (RDF) medical data with the help of the Patient Clinical Data (PCD) ontology. Afterwards, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) guidelines, and RDF medical data are used to develop ontologies for VBDs, and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules are applied for diagnosis and treatment. The developed ontology helps in the construction of decision support systems (DSS) for the NVBDCP to control these diseases. "
