  "title": "Regret Lower Bounds for Learning Linear Quadratic Gaussian Systems",
  "abstract": "  TWe establish regret lower bounds for adaptively controlling an unknown linear Gaussian system with quadratic costs. We combine ideas from experiment design, estimation theory and a perturbation bound of certain information matrices to derive regret lower bounds exhibiting scaling on the order of magnitude $\\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon $T$. Our bounds accurately capture the role of control-theoretic parameters and we are able to show that systems that are hard to control are also hard to learn to control; when instantiated to state feedback systems we recover the dimensional dependency of earlier work but with improved scaling with system-theoretic constants such as system costs and Gramians. Furthermore, we extend our results to a class of partially observed systems and demonstrate that systems with poor observability structure also are hard to learn to control. "
