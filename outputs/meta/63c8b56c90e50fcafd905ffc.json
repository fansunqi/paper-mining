  "abstract": "  Behavior Trees are a task switching policy representation that can grant reactiveness and fault tolerance. Moreover, because of their structure and modularity, a variety of methods can be used to generate them automatically. In this short paper we introduce Behavior Trees in the context of robotic applications, with overview of autonomous synthesis methods. "
