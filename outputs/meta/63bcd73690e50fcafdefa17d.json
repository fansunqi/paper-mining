  "title": "Scholar Ranking 2023: Ranking of Computer Science Departments Based on\n  Faculty Citations",
  "abstract": "  Scholar Ranking 2023 is the second edition of U.S. Computer Science (CS) departments ranking based on faculty citation measures. Using Google Scholar, we gathered data about publication citations for 5,574 tenure-track faculty from 185 U.S. universities. For each faculty, we extracted their t10 index, defined as the number of citations received by their 10th highest cited paper. For each department, we calculated four quality metrics: median t10 (m10), the geometric mean of t10 (g10), and the number of well-cited faculty with t10 above 40% (c40) and 60% (c60) of the national average. We fitted a linear regression model using those four measures to match the 2022 U.S. News ranking scores of CS doctoral programs. The resulting model provides Scholar Ranking 2023, which can be found at https://chi.temple.edu/csranking. "
