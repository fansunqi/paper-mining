  "abstract": "  Cloud-based distributed databases are a popular choice for many current applications, especially those that run over the Internet. By incorporating distributed database systems within cloud environments, it has enabled businesses to scale operations to a global level, all while achieving desired standards of system reliability, availability, and responsiveness. Cloud providers offer infrastructure and management tools for distributed databases as Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), re-purposing the investment by businesses towards database services. This paper reviews the functionality of these services, by highlighting Amazon Relational Data Service (RDS), suited for handling relational distributed databases. "
