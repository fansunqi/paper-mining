  "abstract": "  We present a novel approach to the parallelization of the parabolic fast multipole method for a space-time boundary element method for the heat equation. We exploit the special temporal structure of the involved operators to provide an efficient distributed parallelization with respect to time and with a one-directional communication pattern. On top, we apply a task-based shared memory parallelization and SIMD vectorization. In the numerical tests we observe high efficiencies of our parallelization approach. "
