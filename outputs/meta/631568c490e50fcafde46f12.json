  "title": "WOC: A Handy Webcam-based 3D Online Chatroom",
  "abstract": "  We develop WOC, a webcam-based 3D virtual online chatroom for multi-person interaction, which captures the 3D motion of users and drives their individual 3D virtual avatars in real-time. Compared to the existing wearable equipment-based solution, WOC offers convenient and low-cost 3D motion capture with a single camera. To promote the immersive chat experience, WOC provides high-fidelity virtual avatar manipulation, which also supports the user-defined characters. With the distributed data flow service, the system delivers highly synchronized motion and voice for all users. Deployed on the website and no installation required, users can freely experience the virtual online chat at https://yanch.cloud. "
