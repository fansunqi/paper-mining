  "title": "A generalized hypothesis test for community structure in networks",
  "abstract": "  Researchers theorize that many real-world networks exhibit community structure where within-community edges are more likely than between-community edges. While numerous methods exist to cluster nodes into different communities, less work has addressed this question: given some network, does it exhibit statistically meaningful community structure? We answer this question in a principled manner by framing it as a statistical hypothesis test in terms of a general and model-agnostic community structure parameter. Leveraging this parameter, we propose a simple and interpretable test statistic used to formulate two separate hypothesis testing frameworks. The first is an asymptotic test against a baseline value of the parameter while the second tests against a baseline model using bootstrap-based thresholds. We prove theoretical properties of these tests and demonstrate how the proposed method yields rich insights into real-world data sets. "
