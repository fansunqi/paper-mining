  "title": "Teaching Pretrained Models with Commonsense Reasoning: A Preliminary\n  KB-Based Approach",
  "abstract": "  Recently, pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) have achieved great success on many downstream natural language understanding tasks and exhibit a certain level of commonsense reasoning ability. However, their performance on commonsense tasks is still far from that of humans. As a preliminary attempt, we propose a simple yet effective method to teach pretrained models with commonsense reasoning by leveraging the structured knowledge in ConceptNet, the largest commonsense knowledge base (KB). Specifically, the structured knowledge in KB allows us to construct various logical forms, and then generate multiple-choice questions requiring commonsense logical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, when refined on these training examples, the pretrained models consistently improve their performance on tasks that require commonsense reasoning, especially in the few-shot learning setting. Besides, we also perform analysis to understand which logical relations are more relevant to commonsense reasoning. "
