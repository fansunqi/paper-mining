  "abstract": "  Efforts to promote equitable public policy with algorithms appear to be fundamentally constrained by the \"impossibility of fairness\" (an incompatibility between mathematical definitions of fairness). This technical limitation raises a central question about algorithmic fairness: How can computer scientists and policymakers support equitable policy reforms with algorithms? In this article, I argue that promoting justice with algorithms requires reforming the methodology of algorithmic fairness. First, I diagnose the problems of the current methodology for algorithmic fairness, which I call \"formal algorithmic fairness.\" Because formal algorithmic fairness restricts analysis to isolated decision-making procedures, it leads to the impossibility of fairness and to models that exacerbate oppression despite appearing \"fair.\" Second, I draw on theories of substantive equality from law and philosophy to propose an alternative methodology, which I call \"substantive algorithmic fairness.\" Because substantive algorithmic fairness takes a more expansive scope of analysis, it enables an escape from the impossibility of fairness and provides a rigorous guide for alleviating injustice with algorithms. In sum, substantive algorithmic fairness presents a new direction for algorithmic fairness: away from formal mathematical models of \"fair\" decision-making and toward substantive evaluations of whether and how algorithms can promote justice in practice.
