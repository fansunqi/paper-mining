  "title": "Patching Weak Convolutional Neural Network Models through Modularization\n  and Composition",
  "abstract": "  Despite great success in many applications, deep neural networks are not always robust in practice. For instance, a convolutional neuron network (CNN) model for classification tasks often performs unsatisfactorily in classifying some particular classes of objects. In this work, we are concerned with patching the weak part of a CNN model instead of improving it through the costly retraining of the entire model. Inspired by the fundamental concepts of modularization and composition in software engineering, we propose a compressed modularization approach, CNNSplitter, which decomposes a strong CNN model for $N$-class classification into $N$ smaller CNN modules. Each module is a sub-model containing a part of the convolution kernels of the strong model. To patch a weak CNN model that performs unsatisfactorily on a target class (TC), we compose the weak CNN model with the corresponding module obtained from a strong CNN model. The ability of the weak CNN model to recognize the TC can thus be improved through patching. Moreover, the ability to recognize non-TCs is also improved, as the samples misclassified as TC could be classified as non-TCs correctly. Experimental results with two representative CNNs on three widely-used datasets show that the averaged improvement on the TC in terms of precision and recall are 12.54% and 2.14%, respectively. Moreover, patching improves the accuracy of non-TCs by 1.18%. The results demonstrate that CNNSplitter can patch a weak CNN model through modularization and composition, thus providing a new solution for developing robust CNN models. "
