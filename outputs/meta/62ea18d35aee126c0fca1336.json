  "title": "Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for RIS-aided MIMO Communications\n  with Low-Resolution Phase Shifts",
  "abstract": "  Practical hardware limitations often impose a reduced number of available phase shifts at the elements of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Most works often assume continuous phase-shits at the RIS elements for the transmit and passive beamforming optimization, which can lead to substantial performance loss. Therefore, to harvest the gains of RIS-assisted multi-stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications under realistic phase shifts, this letter proposes a problem formulation for the maximization of the achievable rate over the transmit precoder and RIS elements, which avoids an explicit discrete constraint while still incorporating its effect. To efficiently tackle the resulting problem when considering large arrays and RIS panels, an iterative algorithm is derived which comprises a sequence of simple projections. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design can be very effective, especially with low-resolution phase-shifts. "
