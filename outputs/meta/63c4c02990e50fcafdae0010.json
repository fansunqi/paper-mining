  "abstract": "  Understanding porous media flow is inherently a multi-scale challenge, where at the core lies the aggregation of pore-level processes to a continuum, or Darcy-scale, description. This challenge is directly mirrored in image processing, where grains and interfaces may be clearly visible, yet continuous parameters are desirable to measure. Classical image processing is poorly adapted to this setting, as most techniques do not explicitly utilize the fact that the image contains explicit physical processes.   Here, we adapt classical image processing concepts to what we define as physical images of porous materials and processes within them. This is realized through the development of a new open-source image analysis toolbox specifically adapted to time-series of images of porous materials. "
