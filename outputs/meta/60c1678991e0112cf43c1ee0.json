  "abstract": "  The problem of causal inference with panel data is a central econometric question. The following is a fundamental version of this problem: Let $M^*$ be a low rank matrix and $E$ be a zero-mean noise matrix. For a `treatment' matrix $Z$ with entries in $\\{0,1\\}$ we observe the matrix $O$ with entries $O_{ij} := M^*_{ij} + E_{ij} + \\mathcal{T}_{ij} Z_{ij}$ where $\\mathcal{T}_{ij} $ are unknown, heterogenous treatment effects. The problem requires we estimate the average treatment effect $\\tau^* := \\sum_{ij} \\mathcal{T}_{ij} Z_{ij} / \\sum_{ij} Z_{ij}$. The synthetic control paradigm provides an approach to estimating $\\tau^*$ when $Z$ places support on a single row. This paper extends that framework to allow rate-optimal recovery of $\\tau^*$ for general $Z$, thus broadly expanding its applicability. Our guarantees are the first of their type in this general setting. Computational experiments on synthetic and real-world data show a substantial advantage over competing estimators. "
