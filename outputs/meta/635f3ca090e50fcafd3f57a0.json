  "title": "Federated Learning with Intermediate Representation Regularization",
  "abstract": "  In contrast to centralized model training that involves data collection, federated learning (FL) enables remote clients to collaboratively train a model without exposing their private data. However, model performance usually degrades in FL due to the heterogeneous data generated by clients of diverse characteristics. One promising strategy to maintain good performance is by limiting the local training from drifting far away from the global model. Previous studies accomplish this by regularizing the distance between the representations learned by the local and global models. However, they only consider representations from the early layers of a model or the layer preceding the output layer. In this study, we introduce FedIntR, which provides a more fine-grained regularization by integrating the representations of intermediate layers into the local training process. Specifically, FedIntR computes a regularization term that encourages the closeness between the intermediate layer representations of the local and global models. Additionally, FedIntR automatically determines the contribution of each layer's representation to the regularization term based on the similarity between local and global representations. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to show that FedIntR can achieve equivalent or higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
