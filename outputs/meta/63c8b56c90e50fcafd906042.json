  "title": "Towards an Automatic Consolidation of French Law",
  "abstract": "  We present preliminary results about Legistix, a tool we are developing to automatically consolidate the French and European law. Legistix is based both on regular expressions used in several compound grammars, similar to the successive passes of a compiler, and on a new specialized language of functional type, allowing to describe the changes applied to the texts. Instead of creating manually a full consolidated version of a text at each modification date, Legistix generates automatically programs from legal documents written in natural language to automatically create the consolidated versions.
