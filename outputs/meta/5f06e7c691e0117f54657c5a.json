  "title": "The algebraic structure of conjucyclic codes over F_{q^2}",
  "abstract": "  Conjucyclic codes are an important and special family of classical error-correcting codes, which have been used to construct binary quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). However, at present, the research on the conjucyclic codes is extremely insufficient. This paper will explore the algebraic structure of additive conjucyclic codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}$ for the first time. Mainly via the trace function from $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}$ down $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we will firstly build an isomorphic mapping between $q^2$-ary additive conjucyclic codes and $q$-ary linear cyclic codes. Since the mapping preserves the weight and orthogonality, then the dual structure of these codes with respect to the alternating inner product will be described. Then a new construction of QECCs from conjucyclic codes can be obtained. Finally, the enumeration of $q^2$-ary additive conjucyclic codes of length $n$ and the explicit forms of their generator and parity-check matrices will be determined. "
