  "abstract": "  The matrix sensing problem is an important low-rank optimization problem that has found a wide range of applications, such as matrix completion, phase synchornization/retrieval, robust PCA, and power system state estimation. In this work, we focus on the general matrix sensing problem with linear measurements that are corrupted by random noise. We investigate the scenario where the search rank $r$ is equal to the true rank $r^*$ of the unknown ground truth (the exact parametrized case), as well as the scenario where $r$ is greater than $r^*$ (the overparametrized case). We quantify the role of the restricted isometry property (RIP) in shaping the landscape of the non-convex factorized formulation and assisting with the success of local search algorithms. First, we develop a global guarantee on the maximum distance between an arbitrary local minimizer of the non-convex problem and the ground truth under the assumption that the RIP constant is smaller than $1/(1+\\sqrt{r^*/r})$. We then present a local guarantee for problems with an arbitrary RIP constant, which states that any local minimizer is either considerably close to the ground truth or far away from it. More importantly, we prove that this noisy, overparametrized problem exhibits the strict saddle property, which leads to the global convergence of perturbed gradient descent algorithm in polynomial time. The results of this work provide a comprehensive understanding of the geometric landscape of the matrix sensing problem in the noisy and overparametrized regime. "
