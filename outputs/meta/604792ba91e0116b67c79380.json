  "abstract": "  \\#P-hardness of computing matrix immanants are proved for each member of a broad class of shapes and restricted sets of matrices. We prove \\#P-hardness of computing $\\lambda$-immanants of $0$-$1$ matrices when $\\lambda$ has a large domino-tilable part and satisfying some technical conditions. We also give hardness proofs of some $\\lambda$-immanants of weighted adjacency matrices of planarly drawable directed graphs, such that the shape $\\lambda = (\\mathbf{1}+\\lambda_d)$ has size $n$ such that $|\\lambda_d| = n^{\\varepsilon}$ for some $0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$, and for some $w$, the shape $\\lambda_d/(w)$ is tilable with $1\\times 2$ dominos.
