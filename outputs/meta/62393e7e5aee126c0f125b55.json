  "abstract": "  Zipper codes are a framework for describing spatially-coupled product-like codes. Many well-known codes, such as staircase codes and braided block codes, are subsumed into this framework. New types of codes such as tiled diagonal and delayed diagonal zipper codes are introduced along with their software simulation results. Stall patterns that can arise in iterative decoding are analyzed, giving a means of error floor estimation. "
