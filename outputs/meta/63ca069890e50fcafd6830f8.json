  "title": "SpotHitPy: A Study For ML-Based Song Hit Prediction Using Spotify",
  "abstract": "  In this study, we approached the Hit Song Prediction problem, which aims to predict which songs will become Billboard hits. We gathered a dataset of nearly 18500 hit and non-hit songs and extracted their audio features using the Spotify Web API. We test four machine-learning models on our dataset. We were able to predict the Billboard success of a song with approximately 86\\% accuracy. The most succesful algorithms were Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. "
