  "abstract": "  Temperature field reconstruction of heat source systems (TFR-HSS) with limited monitoring sensors occurred in thermal management plays an important role in real time health detection system of electronic equipment in engineering. However, prior methods with common interpolations usually cannot provide accurate reconstruction performance as required. In addition, there exists no public dataset for widely research of reconstruction methods to further boost the reconstruction performance and engineering applications. To overcome this problem, this work develops a machine learning modelling benchmark for TFR-HSS task. First, the TFR-HSS task is mathematically modelled from real-world engineering problem and four types of numerically modellings have been constructed to transform the problem into discrete mapping forms. Then, this work proposes a set of machine learning modelling methods, including the general machine learning methods and the deep learning methods, to advance the state-of-the-art methods over temperature field reconstruction. More importantly, this work develops a novel benchmark dataset, namely Temperature Field Reconstruction Dataset (TFRD), to evaluate these machine learning modelling methods for the TFR-HSS task. Finally, a performance analysis of typical methods is given on TFRD, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark. "
