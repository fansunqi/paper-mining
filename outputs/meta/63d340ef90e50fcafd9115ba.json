  "abstract": "  Invariant sets are a key ingredient for verifying safety and other properties of cyber-physical systems that mix discrete and continuous dynamics. We adapt the elimination-theoretic Rosenfeld-Gr\\\"{o}bner algorithm to systematically obtain algebraic invariants of polynomial dynamical systems without using Gr\\\"{o}bner bases or quantifier elimination. We identify totally real varieties as an important class for efficient invariance checking. "
