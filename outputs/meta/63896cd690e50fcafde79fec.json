  "title": "Tutte Embeddings of Tetrahedral Meshes",
  "abstract": "  Tutte's embedding theorem states that every 3-connected graph without a $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ minor (i.e. a planar graph) is embedded in the plane if the outer face is in convex position and the interior vertices are convex combinations of their neighbors. We show that this result extends to simply connected tetrahedral meshes in a natural way: for the tetrahedral mesh to be embedded if the outer polyhedron is in convex position and the interior vertices are convex combination of their neighbors it is sufficient (but not necessary) that the graph of the tetrahedral mesh contains no $K_6$ and no $K_{3,3,1}$, and all triangles incident on three boundary vertices are boundary triangles.
