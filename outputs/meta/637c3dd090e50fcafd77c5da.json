  "title": "ESTAS: Effective and Stable Trojan Attacks in Self-supervised Encoders\n  with One Target Unlabelled Sample",
  "abstract": "  Emerging self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a popular image representation encoding method to obviate the reliance on labeled data and learn rich representations from large-scale, ubiquitous unlabelled data. Then one can train a downstream classifier on top of the pre-trained SSL image encoder with few or no labeled downstream data. Although extensive works show that SSL has achieved remarkable and competitive performance on different downstream tasks, its security concerns, e.g, Trojan attacks in SSL encoders, are still not well-studied. In this work, we present a novel Trojan Attack method, denoted by ESTAS, that can enable an effective and stable attack in SSL encoders with only one target unlabeled sample. In particular, we propose consistent trigger poisoning and cascade optimization in ESTAS to improve attack efficacy and model accuracy, and eliminate the expensive target-class data sample extraction from large-scale disordered unlabelled data. Our substantial experiments on multiple datasets show that ESTAS stably achieves > 99% attacks success rate (ASR) with one target-class sample. Compared to prior works, ESTAS attains > 30% ASR increase and > 8.3% accuracy improvement on average. "
