  "abstract": "  An open research question in deep reinforcement learning is how to focus the policy learning of key decisions within a sparse domain. This paper emphasizes combining the advantages of inputoutput hidden Markov models and reinforcement learning towards interpretable maintenance decisions. We propose a novel hierarchical-modeling methodology that, at a high level, detects and interprets the root cause of a failure as well as the health degradation of the turbofan engine, while, at a low level, it provides the optimal replacement policy. It outperforms the baseline performance of deep reinforcement learning methods applied directly to the raw data or when using a hidden Markov model without such a specialized hierarchy. It also provides comparable performance to prior work, however, with the additional benefit of interpretability. "
