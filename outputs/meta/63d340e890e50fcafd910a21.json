  "abstract": "  Considering the 21st century skills and the importance of STEM education in fulfilling these skills, it is clear that the course materials should be materials that bring students together with technology and attract their attention, apart from traditional materials. In addition, in terms of the applicability of these materials, it is very important that the materials are affordable and easily accessible. In this study two open ended resonance tube, Computer and speaker for generate sound with different frequencies, Arduino UNO, AR-054 Sound Sensor, Green LED and 220 ohm resistance were used for measure the speed of sound in air at room tempature. With the help of sound sensor, two consecutive harmonic frequency values were determined and the fundamental frequency was calculated. Using the tube features and the fundamental frequency value, the speed of sound propagation in the air at room temperature was calculated as 386.42 m/s. This value is theoretically 346 m/s. This study, in which the propagation speed of the sound is calculated with very low cost and coding studies with 12% error margin, is important in terms of hosting all STEM gains and can be easily applied in classrooms.
