  "abstract": "  Distributed-Something coordinates the distribution of any Dockerized workflow using on-demand computational infrastructure from Amazon Web Services to enable at-scale workflows where neither computing power nor data storage are limited by local availability while minimizing the time-consuming and confusing aspects of architecture coordination. We also provide Distributed-Something implementations of several bioimaging tools: Distributed-CellProfiler, -Fiji, and -OmeZarrCreator. All are open-source and available at http://GitHub.com/DistributedScience. "
