  "title": "Uniqueness of the Gibbs measure for the $4$-state anti-ferromagnetic\n  Potts model on the regular tree",
  "abstract": "  We show that the $4$-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts model with interaction parameter $w\\in(0,1)$ on the infinite $(d+1)$-regular tree has a unique Gibbs measure if $w\\geq 1-\\frac{4}{d+1}$ for all $d\\geq 4$. This is tight since it is known that there are multiple Gibbs measures when $0\\leq w<1-\\frac{4}{d+1}$ and $d\\geq 4$.   We moreover give a new proof of the uniqueness of the Gibbs measure for the $3$-state Potts model on the $(d+1)$-regular tree for $w\\geq 1-\\frac{3}{d+1}$ when $d\\geq 3$ and for $w\\in (0,1)$ when $d=2$.
