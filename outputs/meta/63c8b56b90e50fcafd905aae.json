  "abstract": "  The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of airway geometry as a biomarker for ASD. Chest CT images of children with a documented diagnosis of ASD as well as healthy controls were identified retrospectively. 54 scans were obtained for analysis, including 31 ASD cases and 23 age and sex-matched controls. A feature selection and classification procedure using principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) achieved a peak cross validation accuracy of nearly 89% using a feature set of 8 airway branching angles. Sensitivity was 94%, but specificity was only 78%. The results suggest a measurable difference in airway branchpoint angles between children with ASD and the control population.
