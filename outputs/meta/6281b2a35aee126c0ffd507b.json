  "abstract": "  We present fully abstract encodings of the call-by-name and call-by-value $\\lambda$-calculus into HOcore, a minimal higher-order process calculus with no name restriction. We consider several equivalences on the $\\lambda$-calculus side -- normal-form bisimilarity, applicative bisimilarity, and contextual equivalence -- that we internalize into abstract machines in order to prove full abstraction of the encodings. We also demonstrate that this technique scales to the $\\lambda\\mu$-calculus, i.e., a standard extension of the $\\lambda$-calculus with control operators. "
