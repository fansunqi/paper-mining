  "abstract": "  Nowadays, many social media platforms are centered around content creators (CC). On these platforms, the tie formation process depends on two factors: (a) the exposure of users to CCs (decided by, e.g., a recommender system), and (b) the following decision-making process of users. Recent research studies underlined the importance of content quality by showing that under exploratory recommendation strategies, the network eventually converges to a state where the higher the quality of the CC, the higher their expected number of followers. In this paper, we extend prior work by (a) looking beyond averages to assess the fairness of the process and (b) investigating the importance of exploratory recommendations for achieving fair outcomes. Using an analytical approach, we show that non-exploratory recommendations converge fast but usually lead to unfair outcomes. Moreover, even with exploration, we are only guaranteed fair outcomes for the highest (and lowest) quality CCs. "
