  "abstract": "  Algorithms are becoming more capable, and with that comes hic sunt dracones (here be dragons). The term symbolizes areas beyond our known maps. We use this term since we are stepping into an exciting, potentially dangerous, and unknown area with algorithms. Our curiosity to understand the natural world drives our search for new methods. For this reason, it is crucial to explore this subject.   The project's objective is to overlay the information obtained, in conjunction with the state of hardware today, to see if we can determine the likely directions for future algorithms'. Even though we slightly cover non-classical computing in this paper, our primary focus is on classical computing (i.e., digital computers). It is worth noting that non-classical quantum computing requires classical computers to operate; they are not mutually exclusive. "
