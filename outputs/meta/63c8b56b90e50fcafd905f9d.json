  "title": "Closed-Loop Magnetic Manipulation for Robotic Transesophageal\n  Echocardiography",
  "abstract": "  This paper presents a closed-loop magnetic manipulation framework for robotic transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) acquisitions. Different from previous work on intracorporeal robotic ultrasound acquisitions that focus on continuum robot control, we first investigate the use of magnetic control methods for more direct, intuitive, and accurate manipulation of the distal tip of the probe. We modify a standard TEE probe by attaching a permanent magnet and an inertial measurement unit sensor to the probe tip and replacing the flexible gastroscope with a soft tether containing only wires for transmitting ultrasound signals, and show that 6-DOF localization and 5-DOF closed-loop control of the probe can be achieved with an external permanent magnet based on the fusion of internal inertial measurement and external magnetic field sensing data. The proposed method does not require complex structures or motions of the actuator and the probe compared with existing magnetic manipulation methods. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the framework in terms of localization accuracy, update rate, workspace size, and tracking accuracy. In addition, our results obtained on a realistic cardiac tissue-mimicking phantom show that the proposed framework is applicable in real conditions and can generally meet the requirements for tele-operated TEE acquisitions.
