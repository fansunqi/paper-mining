  "title": "Load Modulation for Backscatter Communication: Channel Capacity and\n  Capacity-Approaching Finite Constellations",
  "abstract": "  In backscatter communication (BC), a passive tag transmits information by just affecting an external electromagnetic field through load modulation. Thereby, the feed current of the excited tag antenna is modulated by adapting the passive termination load. This paper studies the achievable information rates with a freely adaptable passive load. As a prerequisite, we unify monostatic, bistatic, and ambient BC with circuit-based system modeling. We present the crucial insight that channel capacity is described by existing results on peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels, because the steady-state tag current phasor lies on a disk. Consequently, we derive the channel capacity for the case of an unmodulated external field, for general passive, purely reactive, or purely resistive tag loads. We find that modulating both resistance and reactance is important for very high rates. We discuss the capacity-achieving load statistics, the rate asymptotics, and also the capacity of ambient BC in important special cases.   We then propose a capacity-approaching finite constellation design: a tailored amplitude-and-phase-shift keying on the reflection coefficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate high rates for simple loads of just a few switched resistors and capacitors. Finally, we investigate the rate loss from a value-range-constrained load, which is found to be small for moderate constraints. "
