  "title": "Efficient Data Mosaicing with Simulation-based Inference",
  "abstract": "  We introduce an efficient algorithm for general data mosaicing, based on the simulation-based inference paradigm. Our algorithm takes as input a target datum, source data, and partitions of the target and source data into fragments, learning distributions over averages of fragments of the source data such that samples from those distributions approximate fragments of the target datum. We utilize a model that can be trivially parallelized in conjunction with the latest advances in efficient simulation-based inference in order to find approximate posteriors fast enough for use in practical applications. We demonstrate our technique is effective in both audio and image mosaicing problems. "
