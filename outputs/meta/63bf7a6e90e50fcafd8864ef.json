  "title": "A note on constructions of bent functions",
  "abstract": "  Recently, Li et al. presented a generic construction of bent functions in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 2735-2751, 2022]. In this paper, we give a characterization for their construction from another perspective. This characterization enables us to obtain another efficient construction of bent functions. Based on that, we derive several infinite families of concrete bent functions and give their duals. Our results show that many known bent functions are particular cases of our bent functions. "
