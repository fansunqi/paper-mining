  "abstract": "  Organizations have to adjust to changes in the ecosystem, and customer feedback systems (CFS) provide important information to adapt products and services to changing customer preferences. However, current systems are limited to single-dimensional rating scales and are subject to self-selection biases. This work contributes design principles for CFS and implements a CFS that advances current systems by means of contextualized feedback according to specific organizational objectives. We apply Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and report on a longitudinal DSR journey considering multiple stakeholder values by utilizing value-sensitive design methods. We conducted expert interviews, design workshops, demonstrations, and a four-day experiment in an organizational setup, involving 132 customers of a major Swiss library. In the process, we validated the identified design principles and the implemented software artifact both qualitatively and quantitatively and drew conclusions for their efficient instantiation. In particular, we found that i) blockchain technology can afford three design principles of effective CFS. Also, ii) combining DSR with value-sensitive design methods explicitly provides rationale for design principles in the form of identified important values. Moreover, iii) utilizing this methodology makes the construction of software artifacts more efficient it terms of design time by restricting the design space of a software artefact to those options that align with stakeholder values. Hence, the findings of this work advance the knowledge on the design of CFS and provides both, for researchers a theoretical contribution to reason about design principles and a guideline to managers and decision makers for designing software artefacts efficiently.
