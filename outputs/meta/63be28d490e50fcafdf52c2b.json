  "title": "Enabling Listening Suspension in the Time Slotted Channel Hopping\n  Protocol",
  "abstract": "  Time slotted channel hopping provides reliable and deterministic communication in IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networks. Although slotted access is able to lower energy consumption drastically by reducing the duty cycle of the radio module, it usually leads to significant idle listening experienced by receivers, which makes it a sub-optimal solution when ultra low-power wireless is sought for. In this paper a listening suspension mechanism is described, which operates at the MAC layer and is part of a more general approach aimed at cutting down energy consumption by proactively reducing idle listening. Links can be temporarily disabled, that convey slow-rate data streams whose characteristics, e.g., the generation period, are either known in advance to some extent or can be inferred by traffic inspection.
