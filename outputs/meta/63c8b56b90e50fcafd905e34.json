  "abstract": "  The mass production of complex software has made it impossible to manually test it for security vulnerabilities. Automated security testing tools come in a variety of flavors, function at various stages of software development, and target different categories of software vulnerabilities. It is great that we have a plethora of automated tools to choose from, but it is a problem that their adoption and recognition are not prominent. The purpose of this study is to explore the possibilities of existing techniques while also broadening the horizon by exploring the future of security testing tools and related techniques. "
