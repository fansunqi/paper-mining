  "title": "Structural Liveness of Immediate Observation Petri Nets",
  "abstract": "  We look in detail at the structural liveness problem (SLP) for subclasses of Petri nets, namely immediate observation nets (IO nets) and their generalized variant called branching immediate multi-observation nets (BIMO nets), that were recently introduced by Esparza, Raskin, and Weil-Kennedy. We show that SLP is PSPACE-hard for IO nets and in PSPACE for BIMO nets. In particular, we discuss the (small) bounds on the token numbers in net places that are decisive for a marking to be (non)live. "
