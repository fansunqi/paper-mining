  "title": "Using I4.0 digital twins in agriculture",
  "abstract": "  Agriculture is a huge domain where an enormous landscape of systems interact to support agricultural processes, which are becoming increasingly digital. From the perspective of agricultural service providers, a prominent challenge is interoperability. In the Fraunhofer lighthouse project Cognitive Agriculture (COGNAC), we investigated how the usage of Industry 4.0 digital twins (I4.0 DTs) can help overcome this challenge. This paper contributes architecture drivers and a solution concept using I4.0 DTs in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and limitations offered by I4.0 DTs for the agricultural domain. "
