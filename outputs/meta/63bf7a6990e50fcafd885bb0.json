  "abstract": "  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology to realize smart radio environment for future wireless communication systems. Existing works in this line of research have mainly considered the conventional passive IRS that reflects wireless signals without power amplification, while in this article, we give an overview of a new type of IRS, called active IRS, which enables simultaneous signal reflection and amplification, thus significantly extending the signal coverage of passive IRS. We first present the fundamentals of active IRS, including its hardware architecture, signal and channel models, as well as practical constraints, in comparison with those of passive IRS. Then, we discuss new considerations and open issues in designing active-IRS-aided wireless communications, such as the reflection optimization, channel estimation, and deployment for active IRS, as well as its integrated design with passive IRS. Finally, numerical results are provided to show the potential performance gains of active IRS as compared to passive IRS and traditional active relay. "
