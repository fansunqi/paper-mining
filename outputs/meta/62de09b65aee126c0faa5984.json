  "abstract": "  A hackathon is known as a form of civic innovation in which participants representing citizens can point out existing problems or social needs and propose a solution. Given the high social, technical, and economic potential of open government data, the concept of open data hackathons is becoming popular around the world. This concept has become popular in Latvia with the annual hackathons organized for a specific cluster of citizens called Generation Z. Contrary to the general opinion, the organizer suggests that the main goal of open data hackathons to raise an awareness of OGD has been achieved, and there has been a debate about the need to continue them. This study presents the latest findings on the role of open data hackathons and the benefits that they can bring to both the society, participants, and government. "
