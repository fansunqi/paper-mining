  "abstract": "  Sensor routers play a crucial role in the sector of Internet of Things applications, in which the capacity for transmission of the network signal is limited from cloud systems to sensors and its reversal process. It describes a robust recognized framework with various architected layers to process data at high level synthesis. It is designed to sense the nodes instinctually with the help of Internet of Things where the applications arise in cloud systems. In this paper embedded PEs with four-layer new design framework architecture is proposed to sense the devises of IOT applications with the support of high-level synthesis DBMF (database management function) tool.
