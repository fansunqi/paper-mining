  "abstract": "  This paper focuses on three critical problems on protein classification. Firstly, Carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classification can help people to understand the properties of enzymes. However, one CAZyme may belong to several classes. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture information from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is modeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions prediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for protein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs. This paper proposes three models for protein classification. Firstly, this paper proposes a Multi-label CAZyme classification model using CNN-LSTM with Attention mechanism. Secondly, this paper proposes a variational graph autoencoder based subspace learning model for protein graph classification. Thirdly, this paper proposes graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and Attention-based CNN-LSTM for compound-protein interactions prediction, as well as comparing GIN with graph convolution networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in this task. The proposed models are effective for protein classification. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/zshicode/GNN-AttCL-protein. Besides, this repository collects and collates the benchmark datasets with respect to above problems, including CAZyme classification, enzyme protein graph classification, compound-protein interactions prediction, drug-target affinities prediction and drug-drug interactions prediction. Hence, the usage for evaluation by benchmark datasets can be more conveniently. "
