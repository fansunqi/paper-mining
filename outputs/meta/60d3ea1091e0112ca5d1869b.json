  "abstract": "  Our goal is to finally settle the persistent problem in Diophantine Approximation of finding best linear approximates. Classical results from the theory of continued fractions provide the solution for the special homogeneous case in the form of a sequence of normal approximates. We develop numeration systems and real expansions allowing this notion of normality to percolate into the general inhomogeneous setting. "
