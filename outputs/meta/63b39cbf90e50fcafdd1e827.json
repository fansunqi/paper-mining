  "abstract": "Bilevel optimization reveals the inner structure of otherwise oblique\noptimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture\nsearch, and meta-learning. A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize\na hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the\nlower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used,\nits theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where\nthe lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we\nfirst provide hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary\npoints of the hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be\nintractable for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable\nnonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies\nthe Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order\nalgorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of\n\ud835\udcaa\u0303(\u03f5^-2), \ud835\udcaa\u0303(\u03f5^-4) and\n\ud835\udcaa\u0303(\u03f5^-6) in the deterministic, partially\nstochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively. The complexities in the\nfirst two cases are optimal up to logarithmic factors."
