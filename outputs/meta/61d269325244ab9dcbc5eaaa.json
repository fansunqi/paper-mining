  "abstract": "  Unrefinable partitions are a subset of partitions into distinct parts which satisfy an additional unrefinability property. More precisely, being an unrefinable partition means that none of the parts can be written as the sum of smaller integers without introducing a repetition. We address the algorithmic aspects of unrefinable partitions, such as testing whether a given partition is unrefinable or not and enumerating all the partitions whose sum is a given integer. We design two algorithms to solve the two mentioned problems and we discuss their complexity. "
