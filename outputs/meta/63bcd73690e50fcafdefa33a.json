  "title": "A double-elimination format for a 48-team FIFA World Cup",
  "abstract": "  I present a double-elimination format for the 48-team FIFA World Cup that solves many of the concerns raised about the considered formats with mixed round-robin with groups of 3 or 4 teams and single-elimination strategies. Using a quantitative analytics approach, I show that the double-elimination format is fairer, more strategy-proof, and produces more competitive and exciting matches. It solves the problems of possible collusion in the group-of-3 form and the high number of uninteresting games in the group-of-4 format. Using the restrictions of the 2026 FIFA World Cup to be held in North America, I demonstrate that the double-elimination format can be implemented in a 35 days window, just a few more than the current format for 32 teams. I discuss how the format can be adapted to the particularities of the host nations in future editions to facilitate attendees' and organizers' planning. "
