  "abstract": "  We show a new PRG construction fooling depth-$d$, size-$m$ $\\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits within error $\\varepsilon$, which has seed length $O(\\log^{d-1}(m)\\log(m/\\varepsilon)\\log\\log(m))$. Our PRG improves on previous work (Trevisan and Xue 2013, Servedio and Tan 2019, Kelley 2021) from various aspects. It has optimal dependence on $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$ and is only one ``$\\log\\log(m)$'' away from the lower bound barrier. For the case of $d=2$, the seed length tightly matches the best-known PRG for CNFs (De et al. 2010, Tal 2017).   There are two technical ingredients behind our new result; both of them might be of independent interest. First, we use a partitioning-based approach to construct PRGs based on restriction lemmas for $\\mathsf{AC}^0$, which follows and extends the seminal work of (Ajtai and Wigderson 1989). Second, improving and extending prior works (Trevisan and Xue 2013, Servedio and Tan 2019, Kelley 2021), we prove a full derandomization of the powerful multi-switching lemma for a family of DNFs (H{\\aa}stad 2014).
