  "abstract": "  We define {\\sc Rectangular Ruler Wrapping} as a natural variant of the {\\sc Ruler Wrapping} problem proposed by O'Rourke at CCCG '21, and give a simple, online and quadratic-time algorithm for it, under the simplifying assumption that the last segment must extend strictly beyond every other in the relevant direction.
