  "abstract": "  This paper presents our project proposal for extracting biomedical information from German clinical narratives with limited amounts of annotations. We first describe the applied strategies in transfer learning and active learning for solving our problem. After that, we discuss the design of the user interface for both supplying model inspection and obtaining user annotations in the interactive environment. "
