  "title": "Detecting Extreme Ideologies in Shifting Landscapes: an Automatic &\n  Context-Agnostic Approach",
  "abstract": "  In democratic countries, the ideology landscape is foundational to individual and collective political action; conversely, fringe ideology drives Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE). Therefore, quantifying ideology is a crucial first step to an ocean of downstream problems, such as; understanding and countering IMVE, detecting and intervening in disinformation campaigns, and broader empirical opinion dynamics modeling. However, online ideology detection faces two significant hindrances. Firstly, the ground truth that forms the basis for ideology detection is often prohibitively labor-intensive for practitioners to collect, requires access to domain experts and is specific to the context of its collection (i.e., time, location, and platform). Secondly, to circumvent this expense, researchers generate ground truth via other ideological signals (like hashtags used or politicians followed). However, the bias this introduces has not been quantified and often still requires expert intervention. This work presents an end-to-end ideology detection pipeline applicable to large-scale datasets. We construct context-agnostic and automatic ideological signals from widely available media slant data; show the derived pipeline is performant, compared to pipelines of common ideology signals and state-of-the-art baselines; employ the pipeline for left-right ideology, and (the more concerning) detection of extreme ideologies; generate psychosocial profiles of the inferred ideological groups; and, generate insights into their morality and preoccupations.
