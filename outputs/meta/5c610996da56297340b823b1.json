  "abstract": "  We obtain a recurrence relation in $d$ for the average singular value $% \\alpha (d)$ of a complex valued $d\\times d$\\ matrix $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}X$ with random i.i.d., N( 0,1) entries, and use it to show that $\\alpha (d)$ decreases monotonically with $d$ to the limit given by the Marchenko-Pastur distribution.\\ The monotonicity of $\\alpha (d)$ has been recently conjectured by Bandeira, Kennedy and Singer in their study of the Little Grothendieck problem over the unitary group $\\mathcal{U}_{d}$ \\cite{BKS}, a combinatorial optimization problem. The result implies sharp global estimates for $\\alpha (d)$, new bounds for the expected minimum and maximum singular values, and a lower bound for the ratio of the expected maximum and the expected minimum singular value. The proof is based on a connection with the theory of Tur\\'{a}n determinants of orthogonal polynomials. We also discuss some applications to the problem that originally motivated the conjecture. "
