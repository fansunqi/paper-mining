  "title": "Discovering Influencers in Opinion Formation over Social Graphs",
  "abstract": "  The adaptive social learning paradigm helps model how networked agents are able to form opinions on a state of nature and track its drifts in a changing environment. In this framework, the agents repeatedly update their beliefs based on private observations and exchange the beliefs with their neighbors. In this work, it is shown how the sequence of publicly exchanged beliefs over time allows users to discover rich information about the underlying network topology and about the flow of information over the graph. In particular, it is shown that it is possible (i) to identify the influence of each individual agent to the objective of truth learning, (ii) to discover how well-informed each agent is, (iii) to quantify the pairwise influences between agents, and (iv) to learn the underlying network topology. The algorithm derived herein is also able to work under non-stationary environments where either the true state of nature or the graph topology are allowed to drift over time. We apply the proposed algorithm to different subnetworks of Twitter users, and identify the most influential and central agents by using their public tweets (posts). "
