  "abstract": "  New reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based amplitude and phase modulation schemes are proposed as an evolution how the phase-only modulation schemes available in the literature. Explicitly, both the amplitude-phase shift keying (A-PSK) and quadrature amplitude-phase shift keying (QA-PSK) are conceived, where the RIS is assumed to be part of a transmitter to deliver information to the multi-antenna aided downlink receiver. In the proposed design, the RIS is partitioned into multiple blocks, and the information bits are conveyed by controlling both the ON-OFF state and the phase shift of the RIS elements in each block. Since the propagation paths spanning from each RIS block to the receiver can be coherently combined as a benefit of appropriately configuring the phase of the RIS elements, the received signal constellations can be designed by controlling both the ON-OFF pattern of the RIS blocks as well as the phase shift of the RIS elements. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that our proposed RIS-aided modulation schemes outperform the state-of-the-art RIS-based PSK modulation both in terms of its discrete-input-continuous-output memoryless channel (DCMC) capacity and its symbol error probability, especially in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region, when considering realistic finite resolution RIS phase shifts.
