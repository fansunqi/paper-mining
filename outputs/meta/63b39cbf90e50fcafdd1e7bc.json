  "title": "Nested perfect toroidal arrays",
  "abstract": "  We introduce two-dimensional toroidal arrays that are a variant of the de Bruijn tori. We call them nested perfect toroidal arrays. Instead of asking that every array of a given size has exactly one occurrence, we partition the positions in congruence classes and we ask exactly one occurrence in each congruence class. We also ask that this property applies recursively to each of the subarrays. We give a method to construct nested perfect toroidal arrays based on Pascal triangle matrix modulo 2. For the two-symbol alphabet, and for $n$ being a power of $2$, our method yields $2^{n^2+n-1}$ different nested perfect toroidal arrays allocating all the different $n\\times n$ arrays in each congruence class   that arises from taking the line number modulo $n$ and the column number modulo $n$.
