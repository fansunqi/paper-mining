  "abstract": "  We present a parameterized dichotomy for the \\textsc{$k$-Sparsest Cut} problem in weighted and unweighted versions. In particular, we show that the weighted \\textsc{$k$-Sparsest Cut} problem is NP-hard for every $k\\geq 3$ even on graphs with bounded vertex cover number. Also, the unweighted \\textsc{$k$-Sparsest Cut} problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the three combined parameters tree-depth, feedback vertex set number, and $k$. On the positive side, we show that unweighted \\textsc{$k$-Sparsest Cut} problem is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number and $k$, and when $k$ is fixed, it is FPT with respect to the treewidth. Moreover, we show that the generalized version \\textsc{$k$-Small-Set Expansion} problem is FPT when parameterized by $k$ and the maximum degree of the graph, though it is W[1]-hard for each of these parameters separately.
