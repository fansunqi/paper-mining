  "abstract": "  In this paper we present GroupGaze. It is a tool that can be used to calculate the gaze direction and the gaze position of whole groups. GroupGazer calculates the gaze direction of every single person in the image and allows to map these gaze vectors to a projection like a projector. In addition to the person-specific gaze direction, the person affiliation of each gaze vector is stored based on the position in the image. Also, it is possible to save the group attention after a calibration. The software is free to use and requires a simple webcam as well as an NVIDIA GPU and the operating system Windows or Linux.
