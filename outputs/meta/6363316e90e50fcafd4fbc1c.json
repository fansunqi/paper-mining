  "abstract": "  We propose a new concept, oblivious quantum computation, which requires performing oblivious transfer with respect to the computation outcome of the quantum computation, where the secrecy of the input qubits and the program to identify the quantum gates are required. We propose a two-server protocol for this task, which realizes an exponential improvement for the communication complexity over the simple application of two-server (quantum) oblivious transfer to the sending of the computation result. Also, we discuss delegated multiparty quantum computation, in which, several users ask multiparty quantum computation to server(s) only using classical communications. We propose a two-server protocol for the latter task as well. "
