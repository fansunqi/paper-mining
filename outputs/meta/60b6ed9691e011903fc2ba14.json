  "title": "Square Kilometre Array : Processing Voluminous MeerKAT Data on IRIS",
  "abstract": "  Processing astronomical data often comes with huge challenges with regards to data management as well as data processing. MeerKAT telescope is one of the precursor telescopes of the World's largest observatory - Square Kilometre Array. So far, MeerKAT data was processed using the South African computing facility i.e. IDIA, and exploited to make ground-breaking discoveries. However, to process MeerKAT data on UK's IRIS computing facility requires new implementation of the MeerKAT pipeline. This paper focuses on how to transfer MeerKAT data from the South African site to UK's IRIS systems for processing. We discuss about our RapifXfer Data transfer framework for transferring the MeerKAT data from South Africa to the UK, and the MeerKAT job processing framework pertaining to the UK's IRIS resources. "
