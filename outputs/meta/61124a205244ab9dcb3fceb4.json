  "title": "Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Document -- FOMC Meeting Minutes on\n  Economic Projection",
  "abstract": "  The Federal Open Market Committee within the Federal Reserve System is responsible for managing inflation, maximizing employment, and stabilizing interest rates. Meeting minutes play an important role for market movements because they provide the birds eye view of how this economic complexity is constantly re-weighed. Therefore, There has been growing interest in analyzing and extracting sentiments on various aspects from large financial texts for economic projection. However, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis is not widely used on financial data due to the lack of large labeled dataset. In this paper, I propose a model to train ABSA on financial documents under weak supervision and analyze its predictive power on various macroeconomic indicators. "
