  "abstract": "  Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the combination of machine learning and logical reasoning, including data-driven logical reasoning, knowledge driven machine learning and abductive learning, in inventing advanced technologies for different artificial intelligence applications. One-step abductive multi-target learning (OSAMTL), an approach inspired by abductive learning, via simply combining machine learning and logical reasoning in a one-step balanced multi-target learning way, has as well shown its effectiveness in handling complex noisy labels of a single noisy sample in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA). However, OSAMTL is not suitable for the situation where diverse noisy samples (DiNS) are provided for a learning task. In this paper, giving definition of DiNS, we propose one-step abductive multi-target learning with DiNS (OSAMTL-DiNS) to expand the original OSAMTL to handle complex noisy labels of DiNS. Applying OSAMTL-DiNS to tumour segmentation for breast cancer in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL-DiNS is able to enable various state-of-the-art approaches for learning from noisy labels to achieve more rational predictions. We released a model pretrained with OSAMTL-DiNS for tumour segmentation in HE-stained pre-treatment biopsy images in breast cancer, which has been successfully applied as a pre-processing tool to extract tumour-associated stroma compartment for predicting the pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.
