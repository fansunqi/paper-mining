  "abstract": "  A zero-sum two-person Perfect Information Semi-Markov game (PISMG) under limiting ratio average payoff has a value and both the maximiser and the minimiser have optimal pure semi-stationary strategies. We arrive at the result by first fixing an arbitrary initial state and forming the matrix of undiscounted payoffs corresponding to each pair of pure stationary strategies of the two players and proving that this matrix has a pure saddle point.
