  "abstract": "  Robotic grasping is a fundamental ability for a robot to interact with the environment. Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object wise, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream application. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named Lang-SHAPE) to learn 3D part-wise affordance and grasping ability. We design a novel two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping network (named PIONEER), including a novel 3D part language grounding model, and a part-aware grasp pose detection model. To evaluate the effectiveness, we perform multi-level difficulty part language grounding grasping experiments and deploy our proposed model on a real robot. Results show our method achieves satisfactory performance and efficiency in reference identification, affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping.
