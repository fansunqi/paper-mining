  "title": "Inference of Continuous Linear Systems from Data with Guaranteed\n  Stability",
  "abstract": "  Machine-learning technologies for learning dynamical systems from data play an important role in engineering design. This research focuses on learning continuous linear models from data. Stability, a key feature of dynamic systems, is especially important in design tasks such as prediction and control. Thus, there is a need to develop methodologies that provide stability guarantees. To that end, we leverage the parameterization of stable matrices proposed in [Gillis/Sharma, Automatica, 2017] to realize the desired models. Furthermore, to avoid the estimation of derivative information to learn continuous systems, we formulate the inference problem in an integral form. We also discuss a few extensions, including those related to control systems. Numerical experiments show that the combination of a stable matrix parameterization and an integral form of differential equations allows us to learn stable systems without requiring derivative information, which can be challenging to obtain in situations with noisy or limited data.
