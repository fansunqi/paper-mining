  "abstract": "  Prabhu (1958) obtained the stationary distribution of storage level $Z_{t}$ in a reservoir of finite volume $v$, given an inflow $X_{t}$ and an outflow $Y_{t}$. Time $t$ is assumed to be discrete, $X_{t} \\sim$ Gamma$(p,\\mu)$ are independent and $p$ is a positive integer. The mean inflow is $p/\\mu$; the target outflow is $m$ (constant). We attempt to clarify intricate details, often omitted in the literature, by working through several examples. Of special interest are the probabilities of depletion ($Z_{t}=0$) and spillage ($Z_{t}=v$). For prescribed {$v,p,\\mu$}, what value of $m$ minimizes both of these? "
