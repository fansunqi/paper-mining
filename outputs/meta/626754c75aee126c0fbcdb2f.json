  "abstract": "  Recent research on Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) has focused primarily on generation-based methods. However, current literature has overlooked the fundamental principles of these methods and has made limited progress in a complex manner. In this paper, we aim to deconstruct the generator-classifier framework and provide guidance for its improvement and extension. We begin by breaking down the generator-learned unseen class distribution into class-level and instance-level distributions. Through our analysis of the role of these two types of distributions in solving the GZSL problem, we generalize the focus of the generation-based approach, emphasizing the importance of (i) attribute generalization in generator learning and (ii) independent classifier learning with partially biased data. We present a simple method based on this analysis that outperforms SotAs on four public GZSL datasets, demonstrating the validity of our deconstruction. Furthermore, our proposed method remains effective even without a generative model, representing a step towards simplifying the generator-classifier structure.
