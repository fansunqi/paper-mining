  "abstract": "  In recent years, graph representation learning has achieved remarkable success while suffering from low-quality data problems. As a mature technology to improve data quality in computer vision, data augmentation has also attracted increasing attention in graph domain. For promoting the development of this emerging research direction, in this survey, we comprehensively review and summarize the existing graph data augmentation (GDAug) techniques. Specifically, we first summarize a variety of feasible taxonomies, and then classify existing GDAug studies based on fine-grained graph elements. Furthermore, for each type of GDAug technique, we formalize the general definition, discuss the technical details, and give schematic illustration. In addition, we also summarize common performance metrics and specific design metrics for constructing a GDAug evaluation system. Finally, we summarize the applications of GDAug from both data and model levels, as well as future directions. Latest advances in GDAug are summarized in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/jjzhou012/GDAug-Survey. "
