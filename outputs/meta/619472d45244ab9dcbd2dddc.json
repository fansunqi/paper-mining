  "abstract": "  Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought benefits, but it may also cause harm if it is not appropriately developed. Current development is mainly driven by a \"technology-centered\" approach, causing many failures. For example, the AI Incident Database has documented over a thousand AI-related accidents. To address these challenges, a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has been promoted and has received a growing level of acceptance over the last few years. HCAI calls for combining AI with user experience (UX) design will enable the development of AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, intelligent user interfaces, or intelligent decision-making systems) to achieve its design goals such as usable/explainable AI, human-controlled AI, and ethical AI. While HCAI promotion continues, it has not specifically addressed the collaboration between AI and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities, resulting in uncertainty about what action should be taken by both sides to apply HCAI in developing AI systems. This Viewpoint focuses on the collaboration between the AI and HCI communities, which leads to nine recommendations for effective collaboration to enable HCAI in developing AI systems. "
