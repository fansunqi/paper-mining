  "title": "D3G: Learning Multi-robot Coordination from Demonstrations",
  "abstract": "  This paper develops a Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (D3G) framework, which enables learning multi-robot coordination from demonstrations. We represent multi-robot coordination as a dynamic game, where the behavior of a robot is dictated by its own dynamics and objective that also depends on others' behavior. The coordination thus can be adapted by tuning the objective and dynamics of each robot. The proposed D3G enables each robot to automatically tune its individual dynamics and objectives in a distributed manner by minimizing the mismatch between its trajectory and demonstrations. This learning framework features a new design, including a forward-pass, where all robots collaboratively seek Nash equilibrium of a game, and a backward-pass, where gradients are propagated via the communication graph. We test the D3G in simulation with two types of robots given different task configurations. The results validate the capability of D3G for learning multi-robot coordination from demonstrations. "
