  "abstract": "  Computationally intensive algorithms such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming killer applications for edge devices. Porting heavily data-parallel algorithms on resource-constrained and battery-powered devices poses several challenges related to memory footprint, computational throughput, and energy efficiency. Low-bitwidth and mixed-precision arithmetic have been proven to be valid strategies for tackling these problems. We present Dustin, a fully programmable compute cluster integrating 16 RISC-V cores capable of 2- to 32-bit arithmetic and all possible mixed-precision permutations. In addition to a conventional Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data (MIMD) processing paradigm, Dustin introduces a Vector Lockstep Execution Mode (VLEM) to minimize power consumption in highly data-parallel kernels. In VLEM, a single leader core fetches instructions and broadcasts them to the 15 follower cores. Clock gating Instruction Fetch (IF) stages and private caches of the follower cores leads to 38\\% power reduction with minimal performance overhead (<3%). The cluster, implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology, achieves a peak performance of 58 GOPS and a peak efficiency of 1.15 TOPS/W. "
