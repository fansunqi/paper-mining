  "abstract": "  New hardware, such as SmartNICs, has been released to offload network applications in data centers. Off-path SmartNICs, a type of multi-core SoC SmartNICs, have attracted the attention of many researchers. Unfortunatelly, they lack the fully exploration of off-path SmartNICs. In this paper, we use a BlueField SmartNIC as an example to conduct a systematical study on the advantages and disadvantages of off-path SmartNICs. We make a detailed performance characterization on an off-path SmartNIC including computing power and network communication overhead, and propose the following advices: 1) Directly utilize the specific accelerators on the SmartNIC to offload applications; 2) Offload latency-insensitive background processing to the SmartNIC to reduce the load on the host; 3) Regard the SmartNIC as a new endpoint in the network to expand the computing power and storage resources of the server host; 4) Avoid directly employing the design method for systems based on on-path SmartNICs. We apply these advices to several use cases and show the performance improvements. "
