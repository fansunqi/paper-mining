  "abstract": "  The traditional USB 3.0 communication based on FPGA uses an external chip as a USB PHY or a USB controller including a USB PHY. This paper realizes a USB 3.0 controller by using FPGA resources, in which FPGA logic realizes a serial interface engine, and an FPGA internal transceiver is as a USB PHY. Used slices percent after implementation is 4.59% in Kintex-7 325t. The test result shows that the speed of USB 3.0 is more than 320 MB/s bulk-in and bulk-out transfers. "
