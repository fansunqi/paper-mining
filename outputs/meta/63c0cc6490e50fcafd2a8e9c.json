  "abstract": "  Service discovery is a crucial component in today's massively distributed applications. In this paper, we propose NDNSD -- a fully distributed and general-purpose service discovery protocol for Named Data Networking (NDN). By leveraging NDN's data synchronization capability, NDNSD offers a high-level API for service publishing and discovery. We present NDNSD's main design features including hierarchical naming, service information specification, and service accessibility. %and illustrate the design with a use case. We also implemented two other discovery schemes, one reactive and one proactive, and compared them with NDNSD. Our evaluation shows that NDNSD achieves (a) lower latency, lower overhead, and same reliability compared to the reactive scheme, and (b) comparable latency, lower overhead at larger scale, and higher reliability compared to the proactive scheme.
