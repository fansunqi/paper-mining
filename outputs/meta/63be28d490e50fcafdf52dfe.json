  "title": "On the Performance of Dual RIS-assisted V2I Communication under\n  Nakagami-m Fading",
  "abstract": "  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity in 5G-and-beyond communication networks supports the futuristic intelligent transportation system (ITS) by allowing vehicles to intelligently connect with everything. The advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has led to realizing the true potential of V2X communication. In this work, we propose a dual RIS-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication scheme. Following that, the performance of the proposed communication scheme is evaluated in terms of deriving the closed-form expressions for outage probability, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Finally, the analytical findings are corroborated with simulations which illustrate the superiority of the RIS-assisted vehicular networks. "
