  "abstract": "  JuMP is an algebraic modeling language embedded in the Julia programming language. JuMP allows users to model optimization problems of a variety of kinds, including linear programming, integer programming, conic optimization, semidefinite programming, and nonlinear programming, and handles the low-level details of communicating with solvers. After nearly 10 years in development, JuMP 1.0 was released in March, 2022. In this short communication, we highlight the improvements to JuMP from recent releases up to and including 1.0. "
