  "abstract": "  Social reviews have dominated the web and become a plausible source of product information. People and businesses use such information for decision-making. Businesses also make use of social information to spread fake information using a single user, groups of users, or a bot trained to generate fraudulent content. Many studies proposed approaches based on user behaviors and review text to address the challenges of fraud detection. To provide an exhaustive literature review, social fraud detection is reviewed using a framework that considers three key components: the review itself, the user who carries out the review, and the item being reviewed. As features are extracted for the component representation, a feature-wise review is provided based on behavioral, text-based features and their combination. With this framework, a comprehensive overview of approaches is presented including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning. The supervised approaches for fraud detection are introduced and categorized into two sub-categories; classical, and deep learning. The lack of labeled datasets is explained and potential solutions are suggested. To help new researchers in the area develop a better understanding, a topic analysis and an overview of future directions is provided in each step of the proposed systematic framework. "
