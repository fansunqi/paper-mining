  "abstract": "Collaborative Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (C-SLAM) is a vital\ncomponent for successful multi-robot operations in environments without an\nexternal positioning system, such as indoors, underground or underwater. In\nthis paper, we introduce Swarm-SLAM, an open-source C-SLAM system that is\ndesigned to be scalable, flexible, decentralized, and sparse, which are all key\nproperties in swarm robotics. Our system supports inertial, lidar, stereo, and\nRGB-D sensing, and it includes a novel inter-robot loop closure prioritization\ntechnique that reduces communication and accelerates convergence. We evaluated\nour ROS-2 implementation on five different datasets, and in a real-world\nexperiment with three robots communicating through an ad-hoc network.
