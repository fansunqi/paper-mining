  "abstract": "  The introduction of the European Union's (EU) set of comprehensive regulations relating to technology, the General Data Protection Regulation, grants EU citizens the right to explanations for automated decisions that have significant effects on their life. This poses a substantial challenge, as many of today's state-of-the-art algorithms are generally unexplainable black boxes. Simultaneously, we have seen an emergence of the fields of quantum computation and quantum AI. Due to the fickle nature of quantum information, the problem of explainability is amplified, as measuring a quantum system destroys the information. As a result, there is a need for post-hoc explanations for quantum AI algorithms. In the classical context, the cooperative game theory concept of the Shapley value has been adapted for post-hoc explanations. However, this approach does not translate to use in quantum computing trivially and can be exponentially difficult to implement if not handled with care. We propose a novel algorithm which reduces the problem of accurately estimating the Shapley values of a quantum algorithm into a far simpler problem of estimating the true average of a binomial distribution in polynomial time.
