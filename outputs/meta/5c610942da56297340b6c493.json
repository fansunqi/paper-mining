  "title": "Low Cost Swarm Based Diligent Cargo Transit System",
  "abstract": "  The goal of this paper is to present the design and development of a low cost cargo transit system which can be adapted in developing countries like India where there is abundant and cheap human labour which makes the process of automation in any industry a challenge to innovators. The need of the hour is an automation system that can diligently transfer cargo from one place to another and minimize human intervention in the cargo transit industry. Therefore, a solution is being proposed which could effectively bring down human labour and the resources needed to implement them. The reduction in human labour and resources is achieved by the use of low cost components and very limited modification of the surroundings and the existing vehicles themselves. The operation of the cargo transit system has been verified and the relevant results are presented. An economical and robust cargo transit system is designed and implemented. "
