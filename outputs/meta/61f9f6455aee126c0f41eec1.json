  "abstract": "  In this paper, we provide a framework for constructing entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) from classical additive codes over a finite commutative local Frobenius ring $\\mathcal{R}$. At the heart of the framework, and this is one of the main technical contributions of our paper, is a procedure to construct, for an additive code $\\mathcal{C}$ over $\\mathcal{R}$, a generating set for $\\mathcal{C}$ that is in standard form, meaning that it consists purely of isotropic generators and hyperbolic pairs. Moreover, when $\\mathcal{R}$ is a Galois ring, we give an exact expression for the minimum number of pairs of maximally entangled qudits required to construct an EAQECC from an additive code over $\\mathcal{R}$, which significantly extends known results for EAQECCs over finite fields. We also demonstrate how adding extra coordinates to an additive code can give us a certain degree of flexibility in determining the parameters of the EAQECCs that result from our construction. "
