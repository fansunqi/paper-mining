  "title": "Deep Conditional Measure Quantization",
  "abstract": "  Quantization of a probability measure means representing it with a finite set of Dirac masses that approximates the input distribution well enough (in some metric space of probability measures). Various methods exists to do so, but the situation of quantizing a conditional law has been less explored. We propose a method, called DCMQ, involving a Huber-energy kernel-based approach coupled with a deep neural network architecture. The method is tested on several examples and obtains promising results. "
