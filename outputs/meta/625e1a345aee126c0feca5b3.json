  "title": "Polynomial-time Sparse Measure Recovery: From Mean Field Theory to\n  Algorithm Design",
  "abstract": "  Mean field theory has provided theoretical insights into various algorithms by letting the problem size tend to infinity. We argue that the applications of mean-field theory go beyond theoretical insights as it can inspire the design of practical algorithms. Leveraging mean-field analyses in physics, we propose a novel algorithm for sparse measure recovery. For sparse measures over $\\mathbb{R}$, we propose a polynomial-time recovery method from Fourier moments that improves upon convex relaxation methods in a specific parameter regime; then, we demonstrate the application of our results for the optimization of particular two-dimensional, single-layer neural networks in realizable settings.
