  "title": "Code Librarian: A Software Package Recommendation System",
  "abstract": "  The use of packaged libraries can significantly shorten the software development cycle by improving the quality and readability of code. In this paper, we present a recommendation engine called Librarian for open source libraries. A candidate library package is recommended for a given context if: 1) it has been frequently used with the imported libraries in the program; 2) it has similar functionality to the imported libraries in the program; 3) it has similar functionality to the developer's implementation, and 4) it can be used efficiently in the context of the provided code. We apply the state-of-the-art CodeBERT-based model for analysing the context of the source code to deliver relevant library recommendations to users. "
