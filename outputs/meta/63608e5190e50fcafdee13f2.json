  "abstract": "  Sound synthesizers are widespread in modern music production but they increasingly require expert skills to be mastered. This work focuses on interpolation between presets, i.e., sets of values of all sound synthesis parameters, to enable the intuitive creation of new sounds from existing ones.   We introduce a bimodal auto-encoder neural network, which simultaneously processes presets using multi-head attention blocks, and audio using convolutions. This model has been tested on a popular frequency modulation synthesizer with more than one hundred parameters. Experiments have compared the model to related architectures and methods, and have demonstrated that it performs smoother interpolations. After training, the proposed model can be integrated into commercial synthesizers for live interpolation or sound design tasks. "
