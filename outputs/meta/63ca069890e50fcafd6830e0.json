  "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a finite, simple, and undirected graph of order $n$ and average degree $d$. Up to terms of smaller order, we characterize the minimal intervals $I$ containing $d$ that are guaranteed to contain some vertex degree. In particular, for $d_+\\in \\left(\\sqrt{dn},n-1\\right]$, we show the existence of a vertex in $G$ of degree between $d_+-\\left(\\frac{(d_+-d)n}{n-d_++\\sqrt{d_+^2-dn}}\\right)$ and $d_+$. "
