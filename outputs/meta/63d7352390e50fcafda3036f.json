  "abstract": "  In this paper, we present the model of the interaction between the spread of disease and the spread of information about the disease in multilayer networks. Next, based on the characteristics of the SARS-COV-2 virus pandemic, we evaluated the influence of information blocking on the virus spread. Our results show that blocking the spread of information affects the speed at which the epidemic peak appears in our society and the number of infected individuals. "
