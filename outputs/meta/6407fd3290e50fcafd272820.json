  "abstract": "  Traditional models of opinion dynamics provide a simple approach to understanding human behavior in basic social scenarios. However, when it comes to issues such as polarization and extremism, we require a more nuanced understanding of human biases and cognitive tendencies. In this paper, we propose an approach to modeling opinion dynamics by integrating mental models and assumptions of individuals agents using Bayesian-inspired methods. By exploring the relationship between human rationality and Bayesian theory, we demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in describing how opinions evolve. Our analysis leverages the Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA) model, applying Bayesian-inspired rules to account for key human behaviors such as confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and our reluctance to change opinions. Through this, we obtain update rules that offer deeper insights into the dynamics of extreme opinions. Our work sheds light on the role of human biases in shaping opinion dynamics and highlights the potential of Bayesian-inspired modeling to provide more accurate predictions of real-world scenarios.
