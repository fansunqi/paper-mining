  "abstract": "  In this paper, the channel of an indoor holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is measured. It is demonstrated through experiments for the first time that the spatial oversampling of holographic MIMO systems is able to increase the capacity of a wireless communication system significantly. However, the antenna efficiency is the most crucial challenge preventing us from getting the capacity improvement. An extended EM-compliant channel model is also proposed for holographic MIMO systems, which is able to take the non-isotropic characteristics of the propagation environment, the antenna pattern distortion, the antenna efficiency, and the polarization characteristics into consideration.
