  "title": "Feel Old Yet? Updating Mode of Transportation Distributions from Travel\n  Surveys using Data Fusion with Mobile Phone Data",
  "abstract": "  Cities often lack up-to-date data analytics to evaluate and inform transport planning interventions to achieve sustainability goals, as traditional data sources are expensive, infrequent, and suffer from data latency. Mobile phone data provide an inexpensive source of geospatial information to capture human mobility at unprecedented geographic and temporal granularity. This paper proposes a method to estimate updated mode of transportation usage in a city, with novel usage of mobile phone application traces to infer previously hard to detect modes, such as bikes and ride-hailing/taxi. By using data fusion and matrix factorisation, we integrate official data sources (e.g., travel surveys, census) with mobile phone data, reconstruct the official data using the model, and incorporate knowledge from digital traces into an updated dataset. We tested the method in a case study of Santiago (Chile) and inferred four modes of transportation: mass-transit, which includes all public transportation; motorised, which refers to cars and similar vehicles; active, which includes pedestrian and cycle trips; and taxi, which includes traditional taxi and ride-hailing applications. As a result, we quantified how much mass-transit reduced its share in most areas of the city, with exception of those where new metro/rail lines started to operate in the last five years; we also quantified how motorised transport increased throughout the city. Additionally, the taxi share increased, and the active share decreased as well, showcasing how Santiago is moving toward less sustainable transportation regardless of the interventions implemented in the city. The results were validated with official data from smart card transactions. "
