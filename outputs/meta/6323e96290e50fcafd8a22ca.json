  "abstract": "  The brains of all bilaterally symmetric animals on Earth are divided into left and right hemispheres. The anatomy and functionality of the hemispheres have a large degree of overlap, but there are asymmetries and they specialize to possess different attributes. Several studies have used computational models to mimic hemispheric asymmetries with a focus on reproducing human data on semantic and visual processing tasks. In this study, we aimed to understand how dual hemispheres could interact in a given task. We propose a bilateral artificial neural network that imitates a lateralization observed in nature: that the left hemisphere specializes in specificity and the right in generalities. We used two ResNet-9 convolutional neural networks with different training objectives and tested it on an image classification task. Our analysis found that the hemispheres represent complementary features that are exploited by a network head which implements a type of weighted attention. The bilateral architecture outperformed a range of baselines of similar representational capacity that don't exploit differential specialization. The results demonstrate the efficacy of bilateralism, contribute to an understanding of bilateralism in biological brains and the architecture serves as an inductive bias when designing new AI systems.
