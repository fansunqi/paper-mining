  "abstract": "  In this paper, we address the problem of determining an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among multiple agents. EFX, which stands for envy-free up to any good, is a well-studied problem that has been shown to exist for specific scenarios, such as when there are only three agents with MMS valuations, as demonstrated by Chaudhury et al(2020), and for any number of agents when there are only two types of valuations as shown by Mahara(2020). Our contribution is to extend these results by showing that EFX exists for four agents with three distinct valuations. We further generalize this to show the existance of EFX allocations for n agents when n-2 of them have identical valuations. "
