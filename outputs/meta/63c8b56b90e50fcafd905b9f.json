  "title": "Drug Synergistic Combinations Predictions via Large-Scale Pre-Training\n  and Graph Structure Learning",
  "abstract": "  Drug combination therapy is a well-established strategy for disease treatment with better effectiveness and less safety degradation. However, identifying novel drug combinations through wet-lab experiments is resource intensive due to the vast combinatorial search space. Recently, computational approaches, specifically deep learning models have emerged as an efficient way to discover synergistic combinations. While previous methods reported fair performance, their models usually do not take advantage of multi-modal data and they are unable to handle new drugs or cell lines. In this study, we collected data from various datasets covering various drug-related aspects. Then, we take advantage of large-scale pre-training models to generate informative representations and features for drugs, proteins, and diseases. Based on that, a message-passing graph is built on top to propagate information together with graph structure learning flexibility. This is first introduced in the biological networks and enables us to generate pseudo-relations in the graph. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in comparison with other deep learning-based methods on synergistic prediction benchmark datasets. We are also capable of inferencing new drug combination data in a test on an independent set released by AstraZeneca, where 10% of improvement over previous methods is observed. In addition, we're robust against unseen drugs and surpass almost 15% AU ROC compared to the second-best model. We believe our framework contributes to both the future wet-lab discovery of novel drugs and the building of promising guidance for precise combination medicine. "
