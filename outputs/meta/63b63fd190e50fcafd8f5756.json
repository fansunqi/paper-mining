  "abstract": "  In this paper, we argue that the paradigm commonly adopted for offline evaluation of sequential recommender systems is unsuitable for evaluating reinforcement learning-based recommenders. We find that most of the existing offline evaluation practices for reinforcement learning-based recommendation are based on a next-item prediction protocol, and detail three shortcomings of such an evaluation protocol. Notably, it cannot reflect the potential benefits that reinforcement learning (RL) is expected to bring while it hides critical deficiencies of certain offline RL agents. Our suggestions for alternative ways to evaluate RL-based recommender systems aim to shed light on the existing possibilities and inspire future research on reliable evaluation protocols. "
