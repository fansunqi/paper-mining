  "abstract": "  We propose a Bayesian tensor regression model to accommodate the effect of multiple factors on phenotype prediction. We adopt a set of prior distributions that resolve identifiability issues that may arise between the parameters in the model. Simulation experiments show that our method out-performs previous related models and machine learning algorithms under different sample sizes and degrees of complexity. We further explore the applicability of our model by analysing real-world data related to wheat production across Ireland from 2010 to 2019. Our model performs competitively and overcomes key limitations found in other analogous approaches. Finally, we adapt a set of visualisations for the posterior distribution of the tensor effects that facilitate the identification of optimal interactions between the tensor variables whilst accounting for the uncertainty in the posterior distribution.
