  "title": "Mathematical Models and Reinforcement Learning based Evolutionary\n  Algorithm Framework for Satellite Scheduling Problem",
  "abstract": "  For complex combinatorial optimization problems, models and algorithms are at the heart of the solution. The complexity of many types of satellite mission planning problems is NP-hard and places high demands on the solution. In this paper, two types of satellite scheduling problem models are introduced and a reinforcement learning based evolutionary algorithm framework based is proposed. "
