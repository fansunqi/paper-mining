  "title": "A Direct Construction of Optimal 2D-ZCACS with Flexible Array Size and\n  Large Set Size",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a direct construction of optimal two-dimensional Z-complementary array code sets (2D-ZCACS) using multivariable functions (MVFs). In contrast to earlier works, the proposed construction allows for a flexible array size and a large set size. Additionally, the proposed design can be transformed into a one-dimensional Z-complementary code set (1D-ZCCS). Many of the 1D-ZCCS described in the literature appeared to be special cases of this proposed construction. At last, we compare our work with the current state of the art and then draw our conclusions. "
