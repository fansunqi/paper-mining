  "abstract": "  $\\text{Parkinson's Disease}$ (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in humans. PD is characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra (a part of the mid-brain). Counting the number of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra is one of the most important indexes in evaluating drug efficacy in PD animal models. Currently, analyzing and quantifying dopaminergic neurons is conducted manually by experts through analysis of digital pathology images which is laborious, time-consuming, and highly subjective. As such, a reliable and unbiased automated system is demanded for the quantification of dopaminergic neurons in digital pathology images. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for the segmentation and quantification of dopaminergic neurons in PD animal models. To the best of knowledge, this is the first machine learning model that detects the cell body of dopaminergic neurons, counts the number of dopaminergic neurons and provides the phenotypic characteristics of individual dopaminergic neurons as a numerical output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in quantifying neurons with a high precision, which can provide quicker turnaround for drug efficacy studies, better understanding of dopaminergic neuronal health status and unbiased results in PD pre-clinical research.
