  "title": "The Internal Operads of Combinatory Algebras",
  "abstract": "  We argue that operads provide a general framework for dealing with polynomials and combinatory completeness of combinatory algebras, including the classical $\\mathbf{SK}$-algebras, linear $\\mathbf{BCI}$-algebras, planar $\\mathbf{BI}(\\_)^\\bullet$-algebras as well as the braided $\\mathbf{BC^\\pm I}$-algebras. We show that every extensional combinatory algebra gives rise to a canonical closed operad, which we shall call the internal operad of the combinatory algebra. The internal operad construction gives a left adjoint to the forgetful functor from closed operads to extensional combinatory algebras. As a by-product, we derive extensionality axioms for the classes of combinatory algebras mentioned above. "
