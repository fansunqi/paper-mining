  "abstract": "  The analysis of temporal networks heavily depends on the analysis of time-respecting paths. However, before being able to model and analyze the time-respecting paths, we have to infer the timescales at which the temporal edges influence each other. In this work we introduce temporal path entropy, an information theoretic measure of temporal networks, with the aim to detect the timescales at which the causal influences occur in temporal networks. The measure can be used on temporal networks as a whole, or separately for each node. We find that the temporal path entropy has a non-trivial dependency on the causal timescales of synthetic and empirical temporal networks. Furthermore, we notice in both synthetic and empirical data that the temporal path entropy tends to decrease at timescales that correspond to the causal interactions. Our results imply that timescales relevant for the dynamics of complex systems can be detected in the temporal networks themselves, by measuring temporal path entropy. This is crucial for the analysis of temporal networks where inherent timescales are unavailable and hard to measure. "
