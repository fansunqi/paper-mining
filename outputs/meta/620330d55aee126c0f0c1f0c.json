  "abstract": "  The enumeration of linear $\\lambda$-terms has attracted quite some attention recently, partly due to their link to combinatorial maps. Zeilberger and Giorgetti (2015) gave a recursive bijection between planar linear normal $\\lambda$-terms and planar maps, which, when restricted to 2-connected $\\lambda$-terms (i.e., without closed sub-terms), leads to bridgeless planar maps. Inspired by this restriction, Zeilberger and Reed (2019) conjectured that 3-connected planar linear normal $\\lambda$-terms have the same counting formula as bipartite planar maps. In this article, we settle this conjecture by giving a direct bijection between these two families. Furthermore, using a similar approach, we give a direct bijection between planar linear normal $\\lambda$-terms and planar maps, whose restriction to 2-connected $\\lambda$-terms leads to loopless planar maps. This bijection seems different from that of Zeilberger and Giorgetti, even after taking the map dual. We also explore enumerative consequences of our bijections. "
