  "abstract": "  This paper integrates manifold learning techniques within a \\emph{Gaussian process upper confidence bound} algorithm to optimize an objective function on a manifold. Our approach is motivated by applications where a full representation of the manifold is not available and querying the objective is expensive. We rely on a point cloud of manifold samples to define a graph Gaussian process surrogate model for the objective. Query points are sequentially chosen using the posterior distribution of the surrogate model given all previous queries. We establish regret bounds in terms of the number of queries and the size of the point cloud. Several numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the performance of our method. "
