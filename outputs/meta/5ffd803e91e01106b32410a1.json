  "abstract": "  In this work, we inspect different data sources for browser fingerprints. We show which disadvantages and limitations browser statistics have and how this can be avoided with other data sources. Since human visual behavior is a rich source of information and also contains person specific information, it is a valuable source for browser fingerprints. However, human gaze acquisition in the browser also has disadvantages, such as inaccuracies via webcam and the restriction that the user must first allow access to the camera. However, it is also known that the mouse movements and the human gaze correlate and therefore, the mouse movements can be used instead of the gaze signal. In our evaluation, we show the influence of all possible combinations of the three information sources for user recognition and describe our simple approach in detail.
