  "abstract": "  The EU ESCAPE project is developing ESAP, ESFRI 1 Scientific Analysis Platform, as an API gateway that enables the seamless integration of independent services accessing distributed data and computing resources. In ESCAPE we are exploring the possibility of exploiting EGI's OpenStack cloud computing services through ESAP. In our contribution we briefly describe ESCAPE and ESAP, the the use cases, the work done to automate a virtual machine creation in EGI's OpenStack cloud computing, drawbacks and possible solutions.
