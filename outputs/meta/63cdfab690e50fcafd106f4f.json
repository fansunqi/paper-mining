  "abstract": "  People all over the globe are affected by pneumonia but deaths due to it are highest in Sub-Saharan Asia and South Asia. In recent years, the overall incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia regardless of the utilization of effective vaccines and compelling antibiotics has escalated. Thus, pneumonia remains a disease that needs spry prevention and treatment. The widespread prevalence of pneumonia has caused the research community to come up with a framework that helps detect, diagnose and analyze diseases accurately and promptly. One of the major hurdles faced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research community is the lack of publicly available datasets for chest diseases, including pneumonia . Secondly, few of the available datasets are highly imbalanced (normal examples are over sampled, while samples with ailment are in severe minority) making the problem even more challenging. In this article we present a novel framework for the detection of pneumonia. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in the tackling of class imbalance problem. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically a combination of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) was applied on the minority class ``Pneumonia'' for augmentation, whereas Random Under-Sampling (RUS) was done on the majority class ``No Findings'' to deal with the imbalance problem. The ChestX-Ray8 dataset, one of the biggest datasets, is used to validate the performance of the proposed framework. The learning phase is completed using transfer learning on state-of-the-art deep learning models i.e. ResNet-50, Xception, and VGG-16. Results obtained exceed state-of-the-art. "
