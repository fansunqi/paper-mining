  "title": "Do the Defect Prediction Models Really Work?",
  "abstract": "  You may develop a potential prediction model, but how can I trust your model that it will benefit my software?. Using a software defect prediction (SDP) model as a tool, we address this fundamental problem in machine learning research. This is a preliminary work targeted at providing an analysis of the developed binary SDP model in real-time working environments. "
