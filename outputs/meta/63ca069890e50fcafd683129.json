  "abstract": "  We present a pipeline in which unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to automatically identify subtypes of hospital patients admitted between 2017 and 2021 in a large UK teaching hospital. With the use of state-of-the-art explainability techniques, the identified subtypes are interpreted and assigned clinical meaning. In parallel, clinicians assessed intra-cluster similarities and inter-cluster differences of the identified patient subtypes within the context of their clinical knowledge. By confronting the outputs of both automatic and clinician-based explanations, we aim to highlight the mutual benefit of combining machine learning techniques with clinical expertise. "
