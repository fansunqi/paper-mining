  "title": "A Characterization of Complexity in Public Goods Games",
  "abstract": "  We complete the characterization of the computational complexity of equilibrium in public goods games on graphs by proving that the problem is NP-complete for every finite non-monotone best-response pattern. This answers the open problem of [Gilboa and Nisan, 2022], and completes the answer to a question raised by [Papadimitriou and Peng, 2021], for all finite best-response patterns. "
