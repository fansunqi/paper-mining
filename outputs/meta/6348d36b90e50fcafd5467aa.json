  "abstract": "  This work first presents our attempts to establish an automated model using state-of-the-art approaches for analysing bias in search results of Bing and Google. Experimental results indicate that the current class-wise F1-scores of our best model are not sufficient to establish an automated model for bias analysis. Thus, we decided not to continue with this approach. "
