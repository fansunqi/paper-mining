  "abstract": "Low-rank compression is an important model compression strategy for obtaining\ncompact neural network models. In general, because the rank values directly\ndetermine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of\nlayer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank\ncompression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic\nway, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied\ncompression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not\ndesigned in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the\ncompressed models on real-world hardware platforms.\n  To address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware\nautomatic low-rank compression framework. By interpreting automatic rank\nselection from an architecture search perspective, we develop an end-to-end\nsolution to determine the suitable layer-wise ranks in a differentiable and\nhardware-aware way. We further propose design principles and mitigation\nstrategy to efficiently explore the rank space and reduce the potential\ninterference problem.\n  Experimental results on different datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed approach. On CIFAR-10 dataset, HALOC enables\n0.07\nmodels with 72.20\nHALOC achieves 0.9\nwith 66.16\nthan the state-of-the-art automatic low-rank compression solution with fewer\ncomputational and memory costs. In addition, HALOC demonstrates the practical\nspeedups on different hardware platforms, verified by the measurement results\non desktop GPU, embedded GPU and ASIC accelerator."
