  "abstract": "  By the time of writing, quantum audio still is a very young area of study, even within the quantum signal processing community. This chapter introduces the state of the art in quantum audio and discusses methods for the quantum representation of audio signals. Currently, no quantum representation strategy claims to be the best one for audio applications. Each one presents advantages and disadvantages. It can be argued that future quantum audio representation schemes will make use of multiple strategies aimed at specific applications. NOTE: This is an unedited abridged version of the pre-submission draft of a chapter, with the same title, published in the book Quantum Computer Music: Foundations, Methods and Advanced Concepts, by E. R. Miranda (pp. 223 - 274). Please refer to the version in this book for application examples and a discussion on sound synthesis methods based on quantum audio representation and their potential for developing new types of musical instruments. https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-13909-3 "
