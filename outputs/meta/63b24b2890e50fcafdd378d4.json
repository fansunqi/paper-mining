  "title": "An Optimal Algorithm for Strongly Convex Min-min Optimization",
  "abstract": "  In this paper we study the smooth strongly convex minimization problem $\\min_{x}\\min_y f(x,y)$. The existing optimal first-order methods require $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\max\\{\\kappa_x,\\kappa_y\\}} \\log 1/\\epsilon)$ of computations of both $\\nabla_x f(x,y)$ and $\\nabla_y f(x,y)$, where $\\kappa_x$ and $\\kappa_y$ are condition numbers with respect to variable blocks $x$ and $y$. We propose a new algorithm that only requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\kappa_x} \\log 1/\\epsilon)$ of computations of $\\nabla_x f(x,y)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\kappa_y} \\log 1/\\epsilon)$ computations of $\\nabla_y f(x,y)$. In some applications $\\kappa_x \\gg \\kappa_y$, and computation of $\\nabla_y f(x,y)$ is significantly cheaper than computation of $\\nabla_x f(x,y)$. In this case, our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. "
