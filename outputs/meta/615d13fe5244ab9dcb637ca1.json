  "title": "Exploring usability of Reddit in data science and knowledge processing",
  "abstract": "  This contribution argues that Reddit, as a massive, categorized, open-access dataset, is a useful data source, for \"almost any topic\". Hence, it can be used in data science, e.g. for knowledge exploration. This statement is backed-up with presented analysis, based on 180 manually annotated papers, related to Reddit itself, and data acquired from popular databases of scientific papers. Finally, an open source tool is introduced, which provides an easy access to Reddit resources, and an exploratory data analysis of how Reddit covers selected topics. These functions can be used as a prelude analysis to a broader exploration of Reddit's applicability. "
