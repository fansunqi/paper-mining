  "abstract": "  Distributive laws are a standard way of combining two monads, providing a compositional approach for reasoning about computational effects in semantics. Situations where no such law exists can sometimes be handled by weakening the notion of distributive law, still recovering a composite monad. A celebrated result from Eugenia Cheng shows that combining $n$ monads is possible by iterating more distributive laws, provided they satisfy a coherence condition called the Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, the order of composition does not matter, leading to a form of associativity. The main contribution of this paper is to generalise the associativity of iterated composition to weak distributive laws in the case of $n = 3$ monads. To this end, we use string-diagrammatic notation, which significantly helps make increasingly complex proofs more readable. We also provide examples of new weak distributive laws arising from iteration. "
