  "title": "CSI-PPPNet: A One-Sided Deep Learning Framework for Massive MIMO CSI\n  Feedback",
  "abstract": "  To reduce multiuser interference and maximize the spectrum efficiency in orthogonal frequency division duplexing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) estimated at the user equipment (UE) is required at the base station (BS). This paper presents a novel method for massive MIMO CSI feedback via a one-sided deep learning framework. The CSI is compressed via linear projections at the UE, and is recovered at the BS using deep plug-and-play priors (PPP). Instead of using handcrafted regularizers for the wireless channel responses, the proposed approach, namely CSI-PPPNet, exploits a deep learning (DL) based denoisor in place of the proximal operator of the prior in an alternating optimization scheme. In this way, a DL model trained once for denoising can be repurposed for CSI recovery tasks with arbitrary linear projections. In addition to the one-for-all property, the one-sided framework relieves the burden of joint model training and model delivery and could be applied at UEs with limited device memories and computation power, in comparison to the two-sided autoencoder-based CSI feedback architecture. This opens new perspectives for DL-based CSI feedback. Extensive experiments over the open indoor and urban macro scenarios show the effectiveness of the proposed method. "
