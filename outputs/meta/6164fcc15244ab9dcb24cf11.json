  "title": "A Generic Knowledge Based Medical Diagnosis Expert System",
  "abstract": "  In this paper, we design and implement a generic medical knowledge based system (MKBS) for identifying diseases from several symptoms. In this system, some important aspects like knowledge bases system, knowledge representation, inference engine have been addressed. The system asks users different questions and inference engines will use the certainty factor to prune out low possible solutions. The proposed disease diagnosis system also uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate users to interact with the expert system. Our expert system is generic and flexible, which can be integrated with any rule bases system in disease diagnosis. "
