  "abstract": "  This study presents a general machine learning framework to estimate the traffic-measurement-level experience rate at given throughput values in the form of a Key Performance Indicator for the cells on base stations across various cities, using busy-hour counter data, and several technical parameters together with the network topology. Relying on feature engineering techniques, scores of additional predictors are proposed to enhance the effects of raw correlated counter values over the corresponding targets, and to represent the underlying interactions among groups of cells within nearby spatial locations effectively. An end-to-end regression modeling is applied on the transformed data, with results presented on unseen cities of varying sizes. "
