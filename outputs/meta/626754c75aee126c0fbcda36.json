  "title": "Partitioning into degenerate graphs in linear time",
  "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a connected graph with maximum degree $\\Delta \\geq 3$ distinct from $K_{\\Delta + 1}$. Generalizing Brooks' Theorem, Borodin, Kostochka and Toft proved that if $p_1, \\dots, p_s$ are non-negative integers such that $p_1 + \\dots + p_s \\geq \\Delta - s$, then $G$ admits a vertex partition into parts $A_1, \\dots, A_s$ such that, for $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, $G[A_i]$ is $p_i$-degenerate. Here we show that such a partition can be performed in linear time. This generalizes previous results that treated subcases of a conjecture of Abu-Khzam, Feghali and Heggernes~\\cite{abu2020partitioning}, which our result settles in full. "
