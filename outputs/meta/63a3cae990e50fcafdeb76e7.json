  "title": "Extended Addressing Machines for PCF, with Explicit Substitutions",
  "abstract": "  Addressing machines have been introduced as a formalism to construct models of the pure, untyped lambda-calculus. We extend the syntax of their programs by adding instructions for executing arithmetic operations on natural numbers, and introduce a reflection principle allowing certain machines to access their own address and perform recursive calls. We prove that the resulting extended addressing machines naturally model a weak call-by-name PCF with explicit substitutions. Finally, we show that they are also well-suited for representing regular PCF programs (closed terms) computing natural numbers. "
