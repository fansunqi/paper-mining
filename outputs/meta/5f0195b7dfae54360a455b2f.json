  "abstract": "  We analyze an algorithmic question about immersion theory: for which $m$, $n$, and $CAT=\\mathbf{Diff}$ or $\\mathbf{PL}$ is the question of whether an $m$-dimensional $CAT$-manifold is immersible in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ decidable? As a corollary, we show that the smooth embeddability of an $m$-manifold with boundary in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is undecidable when $n-m$ is even and $11m \\geq 10n+1$. "
