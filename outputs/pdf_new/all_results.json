    "abstract": "We discuss our transient search for directed energy systems in local galaxies, with calculations indicating the ability of modest searches to detect optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources in the closest galaxies. Our analysis follows Lubin (2016) where a messenger civilization follows a beacon strategy we call \u201cintelligent targeting.\u201d We plot the required laser time to achieve an SNR of 10 and find the time for a blind transmission to target all stars in the Milky Way to be achievable for local galactic civilizations. As high cadence and sky coverage is the pathway to enable such a detection, we operate the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) targeting M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) via Las Cumbres Observatory\u2019s (LCO) network of 0.4m telescopes. We explore the ability of modest searches like the LGTS to detect directed pulses in optical and near-infrared wavelengths from Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) at these distances and conclude a civilization utilizing less powerful laser technology than we can construct in this century is readily detectable with the LGTS\u2019s observational capabilities. Data processing of 30,000 LGTS images spanning 5 years is in progress with the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP; Thomas et al. (2025)).",

    "abstract": "Magnetic hysteresis properties in Fe/Si multilayers have been studied as a function of the B4C content to control magnetization amplitude, coercivity, and hysteresis tilt, properties that are beneficial to tune for advancing applications in e.g. data storage, spintronics, and sensors. With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B4C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with \uf04c=30\u00c5 periodicity, 10-15% of B4C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B4C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B\u2084C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B4C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Conventional predictive modeling of parametric relationships in manufacturing processes is limited by the subjectivity of human expertise and intuition and by the cost and time of experimental data generation. This work addresses this issue by establishing a new Large Language Model (LLM) framework. The novelty lies in combining automatic extraction of process-relevant knowledge embedded in the literature with iterative model refinement based on a small amount of experimental data. This approach is evaluated on three distinct manufacturing processes that are based on machining, deformation, and additive principles. The results show that for the same small experimental data budget the models derived by our framework have unexpectedly high extrapolative performance, often surpassing the capabilities of conventional Machine Learning. Further, our approach eliminates manual generation of initial models or expertise-dependent interpretation of the literature. The results also reveal the importance of the nature of the knowledge extracted from the literature and the significance of both the knowledge extraction and model refinement components.",

This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/321108].

Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.",

In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.",
