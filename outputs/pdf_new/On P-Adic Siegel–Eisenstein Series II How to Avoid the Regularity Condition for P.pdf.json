  "abstract": "In a previous paper, the authors showed that two kinds of p-adic Siegel\u2013Eisenstein series of degree n coincide with classical modular forms of weight k for \u03930(p), under the assumption that p is a regular prime. The purpose of this paper is to show that this condition on p can be removed if the degree n is low compared with k, namely, n \u2264 2k + 1.",
