  "abstract": "Magnetic hysteresis properties in Fe/Si multilayers have been studied as a function of the B4C content to control magnetization amplitude, coercivity, and hysteresis tilt, properties that are beneficial to tune for advancing applications in e.g. data storage, spintronics, and sensors. With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B4C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with \uf04c=30\u00c5 periodicity, 10-15% of B4C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B4C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B\u2084C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B4C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency.",
