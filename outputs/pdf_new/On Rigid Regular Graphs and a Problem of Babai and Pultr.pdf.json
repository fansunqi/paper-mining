    "A graph is rigid if it only admits the identity endomorphism. We show that for every d \u2265 3 there exist infinitely many mutually rigid d-regular graphs of arbitrary odd girth g \u2265 7. Moreover, we determine the minimum order of a rigid d-regular graph for every d \u2265 3. This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/321108]. Further, we use our construction to show that every finite monoid is isomorphic to the endomorphism monoid of a regular graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B, 1980]."
