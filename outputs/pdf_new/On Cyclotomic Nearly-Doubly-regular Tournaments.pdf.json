  "abstract": "Nearly-doubly-regular tournaments have played significant roles in extremal graph theory. In this note, we determine all possible cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and their spectrum. Furthermore, under the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F in analytic number theory, our results confirm the conjecture due to Sergey Savchenko (J. Graph Theory 83 (2016), 44\u201377) on the existence of infinitely many nearly-doubly-regular tournaments with the canonical spectrum.",
