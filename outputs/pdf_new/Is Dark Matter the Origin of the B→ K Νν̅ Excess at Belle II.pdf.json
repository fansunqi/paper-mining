  "abstract": "We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of B+ \u2192 K+ + invisible events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for B+ \u2192 K+\u03bd\u03bd\u0304, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.",
