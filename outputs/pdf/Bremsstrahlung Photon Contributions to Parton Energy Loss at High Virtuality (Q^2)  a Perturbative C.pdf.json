  "abstract": "Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128\u2013170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at O(\u03b1em\u03b1s) giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair-production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision-kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse- momentum-dependent parton distribution functions. I. INTRODUCTION Ultra-relativistic heavy-ions collisions performed at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produce a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, called quark-gluon plasma (QGP). One of the primary goals of these collisions is to constrain properties of QGP, through, e.g., the modifications it imparts on high-energy jets and photons. In past decades, many observables have been proposed to constrain the patron energy loss, including high-pT hadrons [1\u20135], single-inclusive jets [6\u20139], \u03b3-triggered jets [10\u201312], \u03b3-hadron correlation [13, 14], flow observables [15\u201317] and so on. The challenge is to describe multiple observables simultaneously. The JETSCAPE framework [18, 19] has emerged as a unified and modular framework comprehensively and simultaneously studing multiple observables, allowing to obtain novel constraints on parton energy loss. Parton energy-loss models, such as MATTER [20], LBT [20], and MARTINI [21] are based on medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung kernel and have been implemented in the JETSCAPE framework. However, a comprehensive implementation of the multi-scale dynamics responsible for medium-induced photon bremsstrahlung computed in parton energy loss simulations is still lacking. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive calculation of photon production from highly virtual quarks of all flavors. As the electromagnetic coupling is much smaller than the strong coupling, electromagnetic radiation can leave the QGP as soon as it is produced and with negligible rescattering, thus carrying detailed information on the QGP state at production time. So far, two approaches have been considered for the real-photon production. Perturbative calculations at low virtualities require extensive resummations, to account for infrared behavior composed of Hard Thermal Loops [22] as well as the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Migdal effect [23, 24]. Electromagnetic radiation from the QGP has shown a remarkable convergence when going from leading [24] to next to leading order in perturbative QCD (pQCD) corrections [25], an observation that is not universal across all QGP-related observables. Indeed, perturbative calculations of the transport coefficient \u02c6q [26], encapsulating transverse momentum broadening of the high-energy partons traversing the QGP, show significant corrections when comparing leading order and next-to-leading order pQCD calculations, at typical QGP temperature scales reached in heavy-ion collisions. A recent comparison of the electromagnetic spectral function in perturbative, i.e. next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations [27], and non-perturbative [28] approaches shows remarkable reliability of thermal photon perturbative calculations, especially when higher temperatures are considered. \u2217Corresponding author: amit.kumar@uregina.ca \u2020 Corresponding author: gojko.vujanovic@uregina.ca arXiv:2502.02667v2 [hep-ph] 10 Feb 2025"
