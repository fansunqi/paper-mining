  "title": "Delta Isobar Resonance Effects on Nuclear Matrix Elements for Double and Single Beta Decays.pdf",
  "abstract": "The NMEs consist mainly of the isospin (\u03c4) axial-vector (spin \u03c3) components. The delta-isobar (\u2206) resonance, which is excited coherently by the quark \u03c4\u03c3 excitation of nucleon (N) in the nucleus, is shown to quench the nuclear \u03c4\u03c3 NMEs by using experimental Gamow-Teller and spin-dipole \u03c4\u03c3 NMEs and QRPA calculations with NN and N\u2206\u03c4\u03c3 interactions. The quenching effect is incorporated by using an effective axial-vector coupling of g\u2206 A /gA \u22480.7 with gA being the couplng for a free nucleon. Impact of the \u2206-resonance effect on \u03bd studies in nuclei is discussed. Neutrino studies in nuclei. Neutrino (\u03bd) properties such as the Majorana nature, the \u03bd-mass, and the right- handed weak currents beyond the standard model (SM) are studied by neutrinoless double beta decays (\u03b2\u03b2) as discussed in [1\u20134]. Astro-\u03bd productions, syntheses and oscillations are studied by \u03bd-nuclear reactions (inverse-\u03b2 decays). Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for nuclear \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 decays are crucial to study these \u03bd proper- ties of the current astro-particle physics interests. The NMEs, reflecting complex nuclear structures, are very sensitive to all kinds of nucleonic and non-nucleonic correlations. Major components of the NME are the isospin (\u03c4) axial-vector (spin \u03c3) ones. Accordingly, the \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 NMEs depend much on nucleonic and non-nucleonic \u03c4\u03c3 correlations. The \u03b2 NMEs are dis- cussed in [5\u201311], and the \u03b2\u03b2 NMEs in [8, 9, 12\u201320]. A nucleus is composed mainly by nucleons (N) with \u03c4, \u03c3=1/2,1/2, and the NN \u03c4\u03c3 correlations are the corre- lations to be considered in \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 NMEs.

Schematic diagram of a QP \u03b2 decay (top) and that of a \u03b2\u03b2 decay (bottom). \u03bd : Majorana neutrino. The NME is given by a coherent sum of a QP NME for n1 \u2192p1 and a GRN NME for \u03a3i ni \u2192pi and a GR\u2206NME for \u03a3k Nk \u2192\u2206k. \u2217ejiri@rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp delta isobar (\u2206= \u220633) with \u03c4, \u03c3=3/2,3/2 is strongly ex- cited by the quark \u03c4\u03c3 flip of the nucleon, and the N\u2206\u03c4\u03c3 correlations are the key non-nucleonic correlations to be considered as well for the \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 NMEs. The strong repulsive (V >0) NN \u03c4\u03c3 interaction pushes up the nuclear \u03c4\u03c3 strength to form the \u03c4\u03c3 NN giant reso- nance (GRN) in the 10-15 MeV region, leaving a little \u03c4\u03c3 strength in low-lying quasi-particle (QP) states. Then \u03c4\u03c3 NMEs for low-lying states are much reduced due to this \u03c4\u03c3 NN correlation. Likewise, the strong N\u2206\u03c4\u03c3 interac- tion pushes up the \u03c4\u03c3 strength to form the N\u2206giant res- onance (GR\u2206) at the high excitation region around the \u2206mass (\u2248300 MeV), and pushes up some \u03c4\u03c3 strength from the N region below 30 MeV to the \u2206region around 300 MeV, resulting in reduction of the \u03c4\u03c3 strength and the relevant \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 NMEs in the N region. The present letter aims to discuss for the first time the GR\u2206effects on \u03b2\u03b2 and inverse-\u03b2 NMEs for such medium-heavy DBD nuclei as 76Ge, 82Se, 96Zr, 100Mo, 128,130Te, 136Xe, 150Nd and others of the current interest on the basis of the experimental \u03c4\u03c3 strengths and the GRN energies for those nuclei. Here both the NN \u03c4\u03c3 and N\u2206\u03c4\u03c3 correlations are considered in the framework of the NN-N\u2206quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA(N\u2206)). The QP \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b2 transition diagrams are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Here GRN is given by a coherent sum of j-neutron (nj ) to j-proton (pj) excitations, while GR\u2206by a coherent sum of Nk to \u2206k excitations. The \u03c4\u03c3 NME for a low-lying QP state is re- duced from the QP NME for n1 to p1 by the out-of-phase admixtures of the GRN and GR\u2206. Actually, the \u2206effects on \u03c4\u03c3 diagonal and transition NMEs have been discussed before theoretically [21\u2013 26]. These theoretical works suggest sivere reduction (quenching) for \u03c4\u03c3 NMEs due to \u2206effects. Exchange (meson) current effects on \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b2 NMEs are descussed [1, 10, 11, 14, 27]. They are related via the meson with \u2206. Axial-vector (\u03c4\u03c3) \u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b2 NMEs are discussed as given in reviews and references therein [8, 9] and in recent works [20, 28\u201331]. There the experimental GT (Gamov-Teller) and SD (spin dipole) NMEs are shown to be reduced much more than expected from nuclear arXiv:2502.06122v1 [nucl-th] 10 Feb 2025"
