  "abstract": "Suppose that a body B can move by translatory motion with velocity \u03b3 in an otherwise quiescent Navier-Stokes liquid, L , filling the entire space outside B. Denote by \u2126= \u2126(t), t \u2208R, the one-parameter family of bounded, sufficiently smooth domains of R3, each one representing the configuration of B at time t with respect to a frame with the origin at the center of mass G and axes parallel to those of an inertial frame. We assume that there are no external forces acting on the coupled system S := B + L and that the only driving mechanism is a prescribed change in shape of \u2126with time. The self-propulsion problem that we would like to address can be thus qualitatively formulated as follows. Suppose that B changes its shape in a given time-periodic fashion, namely, \u2126(t + T) = \u2126(t), for some T > 0 and all t \u2208R. Then, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the map t 7\u2192\u2126(t) securing that B self-propels, that is, G covers any given finite distance in a finite time. We show that this problem is solvable, in a suitable function class, provided the amplitude of the oscillations is below a given constant. Moreover, we provide examples where the propelling velocity of B is explicitly evaluated in terms of the physical parameters and the frequency of oscillations. Keywords.

The fundamental problem that one wants to investigate can be roughly formulated as follows How can living creatures or mechanical devices move in a fluid by changing the shape of their bodies? This is one of the two questions (the other being the nature of turbulence) that tormented Leonardo da Vinci throughout his life, and to which he also dedicated a short essay (Codex \u201cOn the Flight of Birds\u201d) now preserved in the Royal Library of Turin [9]. The first systematic study of the locomotion of aquatic and aerial animals dates back to 1681, with the famous treatise of the Neapolitan physiologist and physicist Giovanni Alfonso Borelli [2]. Borelli, in fact, is also credited with designing the first submarine [8]. In modern times, the topic has been further studied by James Gray, in particular with his work on the motion of eels [25] and the paradoxical conclusion regarding the swimming efficiency of dolphins [26]; see also [27]. The use of a mathematical approach to the study of self-propulsion is, however, relatively recent and began with the seminal work of G.I. Taylor [55]. Taylor\u2019s analysis concerns the intriguing problem of the motion of microorganisms in a liquid at zero Reynolds number, that is, in the absence of inertia of the liquid. The remarkable feature of such motion is that it cannot be generated by a reversible periodic oscillation of the body, since whatever the creature would accomplish with one flap of a part of his body will be immediately lost with the next reverted flap. This argument was later made precise in the well-known \u201cscallop theorem\u201d of E.M. Purcell [54].
