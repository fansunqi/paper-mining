  "abstract": "\u2014In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), embodied artificial intelligence presents transformative oppor- tunities for robotic manipulation tasks. Ultrasound imaging, a widely used and cost-effective medical diagnostic procedure, faces challenges due to the global shortage of professional sonographers. To address this issue, we propose USPilot, an embodied robotic assistant ultrasound system powered by an LLM-based framework to enable autonomous ultrasound acqui- sition. USPilot is designed to function as a virtual sonographer, capable of responding to patients\u2019 ultrasound-related queries and performing ultrasound scans based on user intent. By fine- tuning the LLM, USPilot demonstrates a deep understanding of ultrasound-specific questions and tasks. Furthermore, USPilot incorporates an LLM-enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) to manage ultrasound robotic APIs and serve as a task planner. Experimental results show that the LLM-enhanced GNN achieves unprecedented accuracy in task planning on public datasets. Additionally, the system demonstrates significant potential in au- tonomously understanding and executing ultrasound procedures. These advancements bring us closer to achieving autonomous and potentially unmanned robotic ultrasound systems, addressing critical resource gaps in medical imaging.

It provides real-time images of internal organs, blood vessels, and tissues without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. This technique is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as preg- nancy, heart disease, and tumors. However, hospital sonogra- phers face significant challenges due to the increasing demand for ultrasound services and the rapid pace of technological advancements. There are over 64,751 sonographers employed in the United States, but the number will need to increase by 27,600 according to a prediction by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [1]. In addition, sonographers commonly experience physical strain from their work. Repetitive motions often lead to joint discomfort, particularly in the wrists, upper back, and shoulders [2]. Research on diagnostic medical sonographers indicates that a significant majority\u2014up to 91%\u2014experience discomfort or pain while conducting ultrasound examinations [3]. To mitigate this issue, it is imperative to consider the implementation of automation, particularly in light of the *This work was supported InnoHK. 1 Mingcong Chen is with the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 2 Siqi Fan is with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 3 Mingcong Chen, Siqi Fan, Guanglin Cao and Hongbin Liu are with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hong Kong SAR, 4 Guanglin Cao and Hongbin Liu are with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

The introduction of automated diagnostic and intraoperative ultrasound systems, which are either guided or assisted by robotic technology, represents a promising solution to the chal- lenges previously outlined. By diminishing the workload of ultrasound technicians, these automated systems pave the way for more sophisticated image acquisition processes character- ized by digital and numerical consistency. There are currently several robotic assistant US scanning systems for specific tasks [4] such as reinforcement learning [5], [6], imitation learning [7], [8] and predefined tasks [9]. However, these systems still require extensive domain knowledge or reward engineering, requiring doctors or engineers to select the specific functions individually. The human-robot interaction methods in these systems may also increase surgeons\u2019 workload or distract them from their current tasks, which do not align with their operating habits. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a sub- sequent surge in embodied artificial intelligence has been observed. LLMs have learned rich semantic knowledge of the world, so they can be naturally used for planning without complex definitions or additional training. This ability of LLMs to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training data allows them to be seamlessly integrated into various applications where decision-making arXiv:2502.12498v1 [cs.RO] 18 Feb 2025"
