  "abstract": "Prebunking, a type of psychological immunization, can educate people about mis- information and lay a foundation of cognitive resilience that makes them more robust against future misinformation. We use a compartmental modeling approach inspired by vaccination models from epidemiology to model the effec- tiveness of prebunking misinformation. Populations are classified into different compartments based on the exposure to prebunking and the propagation of misinformation through online social networks. Specific rates dictate the transi- tions between such states, similar to how people traverse between susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments in classical epidemiological models. This model integrates different levels of prebunking potency, the fraction of the population prebunked initially, and the forgetting rate effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work which study the extent of prebunking interventions to reduce the scale of misinformation, much as vaccinations curtail the spread of infectious diseases. Our study introduces the IPSR model, a fresh framework inspired by ideas from epidemiology, specifically models used for weak vaccination strategies. This model breaks down how misinformation travels through society by cat- egorizing people into four groups: those who haven\u2019t yet heard the misinformation (we call them Ignorant), those who have been given prebunking (Prebunked), individu- als actively spreading false information (Spreaders), and those who have known but do not share it (Stiflers). The study explores how effectively prebunking intervenes in the spread of misinformation, what portion of the popu- lation to be prebunked, and how it affects the spreading when people tend to forget the prebunking messages. By combining mathematical analysis with computer simula- tions, our study shows that when prebunking is well em- ployed, it can dramatically reduce the spread of false in- formation. This work quantifies the effect of Prebunking on resistance to misinformation, helping guide optimal in- tervention to protect society from misinformation spread. I. INTRODUCTION In the present era, digital information spreads faster than ever before. This rapid flow of information, while beneficial in many ways, also carries significant risks, particularly when it comes to misinformation. Misinformation refers to con- tent that is false or misleading, whether shared intentionally or not. The impact of this misinformation can be profound, undermining public understanding, jeopardizing safety, and influencing crucial decision-making processes. Social net- works amplify this challenge, as their algorithms often prior- itize sensational or divisive content, making misinformation highly visible and readily accessible1\u20135. Digital misinforma- tion on social media has become so widespread that the World Economic Forum (WEF) now considers it a major threat of the 21st century6. Counter responses, like debunking or fact- checking, which are reactive in nature, lack the timeliness or scope needed to effectively counter misinformation once it has already reached a broad audience7,8. It has been observed that post debunking, individuals\u2019 perceptions remain shaped by the continued influence effect of misinformation, which makes them less effective9\u201311. As a result, misinformation interven- tion studies have shifted toward preventive strategies, such as prebunking. It is one of the most promising approaches to in- oculate individuals against the influence of false information before they encounter it12. Prebunking, rooted in inoculation theory13, applies a psy- chological principle akin to vaccination. This theory was introduced by William J. McGuire in the 1960s and says that exposing people to weakened forms of challenges could enhance their resilience to future attempts at persuasion14. This preemptive approach helps individuals develop \u201ccog- nitive immunity\u201d, equipping them with mental defenses against manipulation15,16. In essence, prebunking involves pre-exposing individuals to typical misinformation tactics or weakened versions of misleading narratives with counter- arguments to build psychological resilience. When these indi- viduals later encounter actual misinformation, they are more likely to critically assess it, reducing the likelihood of its spread. This process has shown considerable success, par- ticularly when prebunking content is tailored to specific social contexts and reinforced over time17,18. The role of analytic thinking in misinformation resistance demonstrates that indi- viduals who engage in more reflective, analytical thinking are less likely to believe false information19. This insight sup- ports the goals of prebunking, which seeks to encourage criti- cal thinking. Recent global events have underscored the need for ef- fective prebunking methods, which affect several processes. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, misinforma- tion related to health risks, treatments, and preventative mea- sures associated with various vaccinations spread rapidly.
