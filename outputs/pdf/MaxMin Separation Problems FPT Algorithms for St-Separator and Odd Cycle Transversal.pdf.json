  "abstract": "In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of the MaxMin versions of two fundamental separation problems: Maximum Minimal st-Separator and Maximum Minimal Odd Cycle Transversal (OCT), both parameterized by the solution size. In the Maximum Minimal st-Separator problem, given a graph G, two distinct vertices s and t and a positive integer k, the goal is to determine whether there exists a minimal st-separator in G of size at least k. Similarly, the Maximum Minimal OCT problem seeks to determine if there exists a minimal set of vertices whose deletion results in a bipartite graph, and whose size is at least k. We demonstrate that both problems are \ufb01xed-parameter tractable parameterized by k. Our FPT algorithm for Maximum Minimal st-Separator answers the open question by Hanaka, Bodlaender, van der Zanden & Ono [TCS 2019]. One unique insight from this work is the following. We use the meta-result of Lokshtanov, Ramanujan, Saurabh & Zehavi [ICALP 2018] that enables us to reduce our problems to highly unbreakable graphs. This is interesting, as an explicit use of the recursive understanding and randomized contractions framework of Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, Pilipczuk & Pilipczuk [SICOMP 2016] to reduce to the highly unbreakable graphs setting (which is the result that Lokshtanov et al. tries to abstract out in their meta-theorem) does not seem obvious because certain \u201cextension\u201d variants of our problems are W[1]-hard. 1 Introduction In this work we study \ufb01xed-parameter tractability of two fundamental MaxMin separation problems: Maximum Minimum st-Separator (MaxMin st-Sep) and Maximum Mini- \u2217Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, India ajinkya.gaikwad@students.iiserpune.ac.in. \u2020Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, India hitendra.kumar@students.iiserpune.ac.in. \u2021Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, India soumen@iiserpune.ac.in. \u00a7Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India saket@imsc.res.in. \u00b6University of Bergen, Norway r.sharma@uib.no. 1"
