  "abstract": "A GL(n) quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertex spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and quantum K- theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double \u03b2-Grothendieck polynomials. 1 arXiv:2502.03768v1 [math-ph] 6 Feb 2025"
