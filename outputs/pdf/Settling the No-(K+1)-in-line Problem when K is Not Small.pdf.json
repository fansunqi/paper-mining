  "abstract": "What is the maximum number of points that can be selected from an n \u00d7 n square lattice such that no k + 1 of them are in a line? This has been asked more than 100 years ago for k = 2 and it remained wide open ever since. In this paper, we prove the precise answer is kn, provided that k > C\u221an log n for an absolute constant C. The proof relies on carefully constructed bi-uniform random bipartite graphs and concentration inequalities. 1 Introduction A set of points in the plane is said to be in general position if no three of the points lie on a common line. Motivated by a problem concerning the placement of chess pieces, Dudeney [8] asked how many points may be placed in an n \u00d7 n grid so that the points are in general position. This No-Three-In- Line problem has received considerable attention: for history and background, we refer to the excellent book of Brass, Moser, and Pach [6] and that of Eppstein [9]. Brass, Moser and Pach called this one of the oldest and most extensively studied geometric questions concerning lattice points. For higher dimensional variants, we refer to [24]. Concerning an upper bound, it is straightforward to see that at most 2n points can be placed in general position. For rather small n, several examples have been constructed where the theoretical bound 2n can be attained, see e.g. [2, 10]. However, it is still an open problem to determine the answer for general n. The earliest lower bound is due to Erd\u02ddos (appearing in a paper published by Roth [25]), and uses the modular parabola, consisting of the points (i, i2) (mod p). If n = p is a prime number, then this yields n points in general position in Z2 \u2229[1, n]2. If n is not a prime, then taking p to be the largest prime not exceeding n and applying the modular parabola in a p \u00d7 p subgrid yields n \u2212o(n) points in general position. The best general lower bound for the No-Three-In-Line problem relies on a construction due to Hall, Jackson, Sudbery, and Wild [15]. Their construction is built up from constructions in subgrids where one places points on a hyperbola xy = t (mod p), where p is a prime slightly smaller than n/2, and yields 3 2n \u2212o(n) points in general position. Interestingly, even what to conjecture on the asymptotical value of the answer for the No-Three-In-Line problem is far from \u2217ELTE Linear Hypergraphs Research Group, E\u00a8otv\u00a8os Lor\u00b4and University, Budapest, Hungary.
