  "abstract": "In this paper, we define an underlying data generating process that allows for different magnitudes of cross-sectional dependence, along with time series autocor- relation. This is achieved via high-dimensional moving average processes of infinite order (HDMA(\u221e)). Our setup and investigation integrates and enhances homoge- nous and heterogeneous panel data estimation and testing in a unified way. To study HDMA(\u221e), we extend the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to a high-dimensional time series setting, and derive a complete toolkit set. We exam homogeneity versus heterogeneity using Gaussian approximation, a prevalent technique for establish- ing uniform inference. For post-testing inference, we derive central limit theorems through Edgeworth expansions for both homogenous and heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we showcase the practical relevance of the established asymptotic properties by revisiting the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators, and a classic nonstationary panel data process. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets. Keywords: homogeneity, heterogeneity, weak and strong cross-sectional dependence, Gaussian approximation, (non)stationary panel JEL Classification: C12, C18, C23, C55 Gao and Peng would like to acknowledge the Australian Research Council Discovery Projects Pro- gram for its financial support under Grant Numbers: DP250100063 and DP210100476, respectively.
