  "abstract": ". We adapt Goldie\u2019s concept of uniform dimensions from module theory over rings to \u0393- monoids. A \u0393-monoid M is said to have uniform dimension n if n is the largest number of pairwise incomparable nonzero \u0393-order ideals contained in M. Specializing to the talented monoid of a graph, we show that the uniform dimension provides a rough measure of how the graph branches out. Since for any order ideal I, its orthogonal ideal I\u22a5is the largest ideal incomparable to I, we study the notions of orthogonality and regularity, particularly when I\u22a5\u22a5= I. We show that the freeness of the action of Z on the talented monoid of a graph is preserved under quotienting by a regular ideal. Furthermore, we determine the underlying hereditary and saturated sets that generate these ideals. These results unify recent studies on regular ideals of the corresponding Leavitt path algebras and graph C\u2217-algebras. We conclude that for graphs E and F, if there is a Z-monoid isomorphism TE \u223c= TF , then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the regular ideals of the associated Leavitt path algebras Lk(E) and Lk(F) (and similarly, C\u2217(E) and C\u2217(F)). Since the talented monoid TE is the positive cone of the graded Grothendieck group Kgr 0 (Lk(E)), this provides further evidence supporting the Graded Classi\ufb01cation Conjecture. 1. Introduction Let M be a right R-module, where R is a unital ring. The Goldie uniform dimension of M, denoted udim(M), measures how extensively a large part of M, i.e. an essential submodule of M, can be decomposed into a direct sum of uniform submodules, which serve as the smallest building blocks. A fundamental theorem states that any two essential submodules of M decompose into the same number of uniform submodules, ensuring that udim(M) is well-de\ufb01ned. When M is a vector space, uniform submodules become one-dimensional subspaces, and the entire space can be decomposed using them. Thus, the uniform dimension of M coincides with the usual dimension of the vector space [13]. In this note, we adapt the notion of uniform dimension to the setting of a \u0393-monoid M, i.e., a commutative monoid M with an action of an abelian group \u0393 on M via automorphisms. We show that such a dimension is well-de\ufb01ned for a \u0393-monoid M and show that it corresponds to the largest integer n for which there exist n pairwise incomparable \u0393-order ideals in M (see \u00a72). For a \u0393-order ideal I of a \u0393-monoid M, its orthogonal ideal I\u22a5is de\ufb01ned by I\u22a5:= {a \u2208M | a \u2225I} \u222a{0}, where \u2225stands for incomparability with respect to the algebraic order de\ufb01ned on M. Since I\u22a5is the largest ideal incomparable to I, we study the notion of orthogonality and regularity, i.e., when I\u22a5\u22a5= I. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. Primary 16S88.
