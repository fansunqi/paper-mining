We performed a computational analysis on percolation transport and filament formation in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 (a-GST) using 2D finite-element multi-physics simulations with 2 nm out-of-plane depth using an electric-field and temperature dependent electronic transport model with carrier activation energies that vary locally around 0.3 eV and as a function of temperature. We observe the snapback (threshold switching) behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at ~50 MV/m electric field with 0.63 \u00b5A current for 300 K ambient temperature, where current collapses onto a single molten filament with ~ 2 nm diameter, aligned with the electric field, and the device switches from a high resistance state (108 \u2126) to a low resistance state (103 \u2126). Further increase in voltage across the device leads to widening of the molten filament. Snap-back current and electric field are strong functions of ambient temperature, ranging from ~ 0.53 \u00b5A at 200 K to ~ 16.93 \u00b5A at 800 K and ~ 85 MV/m at 150 K to 45 MV/m at 350 K, respectively. Snap-back electric-field decreases exponentially with increasing device length, converging to ~ 38 MV/m for devices longer than 200 nm. I. INTRODUCTION ecent years have seen a rapid growth in data generation and processing demands due to advances in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and neuromorphic computing.[1], [2] Conventional computer architecture and memory technologies are struggling to cope with this demand[3], [4]. One of the major performance limitations is the memory access latencies between CPU, high speed low density volatile memory (DRAM), and low speed high density non-volatile memory (flash)[5], [6]. Emerging electronic memory technologies aim to fill the performance and density gap in memory hierarchy[7]\u2013[12]. Phase change memory (PCM) has demonstrated significant prospect in this regard[2], [13] due to its faster read/write speed (10~100ns) and superior endurance (~1012 cycles) compared to flash while maintaining similar density as flash[14] and data retention (10 years at CPU temperature)[13]\u2013[15]. Typical PCM devices are fabricated as vertical cells using phase change materials with top and bottom contacts. PCM materials offer (i) reversible switching between their amorphous and crystalline phases, (ii) significant contrast in resistivity between their phases, (iii) fast switching between phases[2] and (iv) low thermal conductivity for power efficiency[16], [17]. Chalcogenide alloys have emerged as suitable phase change materials[18]\u2013[22], among which Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is found out to be the most promising and is the most-studied phase change material[18], [23]\u2013[28]. GST shows high resistance contrast (~104) between its amorphous and crystalline phases[26], [29]\u2013[31], high crystallization temperature (~400 K)[32], low melting point (Tmelt ~858 K[25]), rapid crystallization (tens of nanoseconds)[33], and excellent thermal stability[27]. PCM devices are switched using short duration voltage pulses that give rise to self-heating[34]. Amorphization (reset) is achieved by heating the active region of the cell to the melting temperature, followed by rapid quenching[35], [36]. Crystallization (set) is achieved by heating the active region above glass transition (crystallization) temperature but below Tmelt for a sufficient duration or by slower cooling from melt[37]. PCM devices experience significant local heating, extreme temperatures and thermal gradients, while the phase change material experiences nucleation and growth of crystals and amorphization. The amorphous phase change material properties are strong functions of electric field and temperature. The local variability in the disordered amorphous phase increases the complexity in operation dynamics. Hence, modeling PCM devices is more complicated compared to traditional semiconductor devices. Here, we study electronic transport in the disordered amorphous phase of GST using an electro-thermal finite element model in 2D [38]\u2013[42] that captures local variations in the materials parameters that depend on temperature and electric field, using COMSOL Multiphysics[43]. The local variations in the materials properties are modeled using a locally varying carrier activation energy (EA) which is also a function of temperature. Electronic transport is modeled using a hyperbolic sine model that captures thermionic emission over a local barrier. The model parameters are based on the experimental values we extracted from high-speed measurements on metastable a-GST [32] (Fig. 1). The functions that define the electric-field and temperature dependence are based on electric- field and temperature dependent measurements performed on stabilized amorphous GST (a-GST) line-cells [44], [45] (Fig. 2). II. ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT IN AMORPHOUS GST The resistivity versus temperature behavior of metastable a- GST (Fig. 1a) is obtained from a large number of high-speed measurements performed on GST line-cells in the 300 K to 600 K temperature range [32]. The metastable resistivity versus temperature characteristics show a simple exponential behavior which can be fitted to[46]: \ud835\udf0c= \ud835\udf0c1\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc47 (1) where \ud835\udf0c1 = 35137 \u2126\u22c5c\ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udefc= 0.0202. The resistivity can also be expressed as Arrhenius form [46]: \ud835\udf0c= \ud835\udf0c0\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47 (2) Md Samzid Bin Hafiz, Helena Silva, Ali Gokirmak Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-4157, USA Modeling Filamentary Conduction in Reset Phase Change Memory Devices R"
