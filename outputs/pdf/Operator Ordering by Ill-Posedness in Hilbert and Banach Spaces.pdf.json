  "abstract": "For operators representing ill-posed problems, an ordering by ill-posed- ness is proposed, where one operator is considered more ill-posed than another one if the former can be expressed as a cocatenation of bounded operators involving the latter. This de\ufb01nition is motivated by a recent one introduced by Math\u00b4e and Hofmann [Adv. Oper. Theory, 2025] that utilizes bounded and orthogonal operators, and we show the equivalence of our new de\ufb01nition with this one for the case of compact and non-compact linear operators in Hilbert spaces. We compare our ordering with other measures of ill-posedness such as the decay of the singular values, norm estimates, and range inclusions. Furthermore, as the new de\ufb01nition does not depend on the notion of orthogonal operators, it can be extended to the case of linear operators in Banach spaces, and it also provides ideas for applications to nonlinear problems in Hilbert spaces. In the latter context, certain nonlinearity conditions can be interpreted as ordering relations between a nonlinear operator and its linearization.

Usually, in the case of linear compact operators in Hilbert spaces, the decay rate of the singular values is used as indicator for such discrimination. In this article we de\ufb01ne an abstract general concept of when one problem is more ill-posed than another by using an ordering relation based on connecting 1Industrial Mathematics Institute, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Alternbergergstra\u00dfe 69, 4040 Linz, Austria.
