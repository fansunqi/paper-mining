  "abstract": "This paper first proposes a bi-level optimization model for the collaborative flight sequencing of arrival and departure flights in the metroplex with multiple airports, considering both the runway systems and TMA (Terminal Control Area) entry/exit fixes. Besides, the model is adaptive to various traffic scenarios. The genetic algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. The Shanghai TMA, located in China, is used as a case study, and it includes two airports, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The results demonstrate that the model can reduce arrival delay by 51.52%, departure delay by 18.05%, and the runway occupation time of departure flights by 23.83%. Furthermore, the model utilized in this study significantly enhances flight scheduling efficiency, providing a more efficient solution than the traditional FCFS (First Come, First Served) approach. Additionally, the algorithm employed offers further improvements over the NSGA II algorithm.
