  "title": "Incorporating Damped Harmonic Oscillator in DSGE Models.pdf",
  "abstract": "These \ufb02uctuations arise due to various internal and external factors, including tech- nological changes, monetary policy shifts, and international economic events. As economies face these shocks, understanding how they adjust and recover becomes critical for policymakers, businesses, and households. Traditionally, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models have provided a robust frame- work for analyzing these \ufb02uctuations. DSGE models derive macroeconomic outcomes from the optimiz- ing behavior of individual agents, such as consumers and \ufb01rms, who respond to shocks under rational expectations. However, DSGE models are often criticized for their inability to fully capture delayed adjustments seen in real-world economies, where frictions such as price and wage stickiness slow down the return to equilibrium. To address these shortcomings, we turn to physics, speci\ufb01cally the concept of the damped harmonic oscillator. This model describes systems where oscillations gradually decay due to friction or resistance, eventually leading to a stable equilibrium. The damped harmonic oscillator\u2019s ability to model systems that experience delayed or slow responses makes it a valuable tool for improving DSGE models. By incor- porating a damping coe\ufb03cient, we can model economies that exhibit varying recovery speeds, depending on the extent of market frictions and policy delays. This paper aims to integrate the damped harmonic oscillator into DSGE models to create a more real- istic framework for analyzing economic \ufb02uctuations. We explore how di\ufb00erent levels of damping\u2014under- damped, critically damped, and over-damped\u2014a\ufb00ect the speed and stability of economic recovery. Through numerical simulations and historical case studies, we demonstrate the model\u2019s applicability in explaining real-world economic events, such as the Great Depression and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Evolution and Application of DSGE Models The development of DSGE models has its roots in Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory, introduced by Kydland and Prescott (1982). RBC models focus on technological shocks as the primary drivers of economic \ufb02uctuations, treating recessions and booms as natural responses to changes in productivity. While RBC models provide a solid microeconomic foundation, they fail to account for market imperfec- tions, such as price stickiness or wage rigidity, which are critical for understanding short-term economic dynamics. The New Keynesian DSGE models addressed many of these limitations by incorporating nominal rigidities, such as sticky prices and wages. These models allow for the analysis of monetary policy\u2019s short-term impact on output and employment, particularly in the presence of demand shocks. For instance, Woodford (2003) highlights the role of central banks in stabilizing in\ufb02ation and output using interest rate rules within DSGE models. However, even New Keynesian DSGE models tend to assume a relatively quick adjustment to equi- librium following shocks. This assumption underestimates the persistence of economic slumps, especially when signi\ufb01cant market frictions or structural issues are present. These models do not adequately capture the delayed responses seen in real-world recoveries, where economies can experience prolonged periods of stagnation or instability before returning to normal levels. 1"
