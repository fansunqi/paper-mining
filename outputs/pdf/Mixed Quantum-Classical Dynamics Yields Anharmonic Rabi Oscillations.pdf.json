  "abstract": "Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence. I. INTRODUCTION Mixed quantum\u2013classical (MQC) dynamics offers a power- ful framework for the simulation and interpretation of a wide range of phenomena. Throughout the last few decades, MQC dynamics has established itself as a preferred approach for the low-cost simulation of molecular systems, wherein nuclear motion is represented by classical coordinates while a quan- tum treatment is reserved for the electronic states.1\u20136 In re- cent years, it has been similarly employed for the modeling of materials7\u201311 and condensed-phase correlated phenomena.12 Although MQC dynamics is commonly found to provide accurate, or at least predictive, results, its realm of appli- cability remains poorly understood. According to the Bohr correspondence principle,13 the classical approximation taken within MQC dynamics is justified so long as the relevant co- ordinates attain large quantum numbers. However, MQC dy- namics has been shown to reach high accuracy even in cases where this criterion is grossly violated.14,15 Such favorable performance may be explained based on the quasiclassical dy- namics literature, where it has been shown that classical equa- tions of motion approach quantum dynamics for harmonic po- tentials and in the short-time limit.16\u201318 Yet, counterintuitive behaviors may arise once quantum and classical equations of motion are combined within a same framework, as famously exemplified by the Schr\u00a8odinger cat thought experiment.19 As an alternative, one may therefore resort to decoherence as a criterion for the applicability of MQC dynamics, meaning that the quantum\u2013classical correlations should remain limited. While most applications of MQC dynamics involve electron\u2013nuclear coupling, light\u2013matter interactions provide a complementary realm of applicability.20\u201327 Notably, the canonical Rabi model, involving a two-level system (TLS) interacting with a single optical mode, was originally pro- posed within a MQC treatment, invoking a classical approx- imation for the mode.28 While originally investigated under high field intensities and with neglect of feedback of the TLS onto the mode, a fully self-consistent treatment has since been explored,29 as well as behaviors in the quantum\u2013classical crossover region.30 However, rapid advances in the areas of quantum optics31 and cavity quantum electrodynamics32\u201339 a)Electronic mail: roel.tempelaar@northwestern.edu have generated a particular interest in phenomena where field intensities approach the single-photon limit, as governed by the quantum Rabi model. Much remains to be learned about the applicability of MQC dynamics in this limit, and the abil- ity of the quantum Rabi model to expose general guiding prin- ciples for MQC modeling. In this Article, we apply MQC dynamics to the quantum Rabi model, specifically considering a TLS in its excited state interacting with a single resonant optical mode prepared in its ground state. When represented fully quantum-mechanically, this model is known to exhibit Rabi oscillations manifested as harmonic population fluctuations of the TLS.40 As we show analytically within the rotating wave approximation (RWA), upon adopting a classical representation for the optical mode, Rabi oscillatory motion is instead governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation.41 This equation involves an anharmonic term contributing a \u201cmode softening effect\u201d to the Rabi oscillations. The solutions to this equation are found to follow the quantum results closely upon (approximately) re- inforcing zero-point energy when initializing the classical co- ordinate. These findings inform on the application of MQC dynamics to coherent phenomena involving small quantum numbers. II. FULL-QUANTUM REPRESENTATION Before turning to MQC dynamics, we begin by briefly re- visiting the quantum Rabi model within a full-quantum repre- sentation. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the scenario where the transition energy of the TLS is perfectly resonant with the optical mode. A schematic of this scenario is de- picted in Fig. 1. Setting \u210f= 1, and taking \u2126to denote the TLS transition energy as well as the optical mode frequency, the corresponding Hamiltonian is given by \u02c6H = 1 2 \u0010 \u02c6p2 + \u21262 \u02c6q2\u0011 + \u2126|\u03d5e\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5e| + \u00b5\u2126\u03bb\u02c6q \u0010 |\u03d5e\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5g| + H.c. \u0011 . (1) Here, \u02c6q and \u02c6p are coordinate-like operators representing the optical mode, |\u03d5g\u27e9and |\u03d5e\u27e9refer to the ground and excited state of the TLS, \u00b5 is the associated transition dipole, \u03bb denotes the coupling strength between the TLS and the mode, and H.c. is short for Hermitian conjugate. The quantum Rabi Hamiltonian, Eq. 1, is commonly for- mulated by expressing the TLS in terms of Pauli spin matri- arXiv:2502.05767v1 [quant-ph] 9 Feb 2025"
