  "title": "Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff Eq.pdf",
  "abstract": "The Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff (TOV) equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. It has been shown in several of our recent works that interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables by using the latter approach. Our approach is based on intrinsic and perturbative analyses of the dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review article, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from solving perturbatively the scaled TOV equations. Whenever appropriate, comparisons with the traditional approach from solving the original TOV equations will be made. In particular, we first show that the nonlinearity of the TOV equations basically excludes a linear EOS for dense matter in NS cores. We then show that perturbative analyses of the scaled TOV equations enable us to reveal novel scalings of the NS mass, radius and the compactness with certain combinations of the NS central pressure and energy density. Thus, observational data on either mass, radius or compactness can be used to constrain directly the core EOS of NS matter independent of the still very uncertain nuclear EOS models. As examples, the EOS of the densest visible matter in our Universe before the most massive neutron stars collapse into black holes (BHs) as well as the central EOS of a canonical or a 2.1 solar mass NS are extracted without using any nuclear EOS model. In addition, we show that causality in NSs sets an upper bound of about 0.374 for the ratio of pressure over energy density and correspondingly a lower limit for trace anomaly in supra-dense matter. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the new approach reviewed here by solving perturbatively the dimensionless TOV equations are outlined.
