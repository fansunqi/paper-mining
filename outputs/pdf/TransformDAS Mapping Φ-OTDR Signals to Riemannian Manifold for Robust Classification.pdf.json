  "abstract": "\u2014Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (\u03a6-OTDR) is a widely used distributed fiber optic sensing system in engineering. Machine learning algorithms for \u03a6-OTDR event classification require high volumes and quality of datasets; however, high-quality datasets are currently extremely scarce in the field, leading to a lack of robustness in models, which is manifested by higher false alarm rates in real-world scenarios. One promising approach to address this issue is to augment existing data using generative models combined with a small amount of real-world data. We explored mapping both \u03a6-OTDR features in a GAN-based generative pipeline and signal features in a Transformer classifier to hyperbolic space to seek more effective model generalization. The results indicate that state-of- the-art models exhibit stronger generalization performance and lower false alarm rates in real-world scenarios when trained on augmented datasets. TransformDAS, in particular, demonstrates the best classification performance, highlighting the benefits of Riemannian manifold mapping in \u03a6-OTDR data generation and model classification.

INTRODUCTION Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) leverages the inte- grated sensing and transmission capabilities of optical fibers to achieve critical physical measurements over long distances and wide areas. As a representative of distributed fiber optic sensing systems, \u03a6-OTDR is widely applied in key areas such as urban underground pipeline monitoring and rail safety, due to its high sensitivity and rapid response[1\u20134]. With the con- tinuous development of artificial intelligence, the performance of \u03a6-OTDR event classification models has improved steadily in recent years[5]. The increasing complexity of industrial scenarios and grow- ing data volumes present new challenges for automated \u03a6-OTDR event classification. Despite more resources, the development of high-performance deep learning models is constrained by two key limitations: data representation and feature extraction[6]. Traditional one-dimensional signal-based algorithms fail to learn from the entire data field and strug- gle with noise in event classification tasks. Spatiotemporal models, although leveraging global sequence modeling, are incompatible with diverse data formats. Due to limited and complex industrial datasets, pre-augmentation is often nec- essary during training[7]. However, many high-performance *Corresponding author: luqi@zhejianglab.com pre-trained models perform poorly on industrial test sets, with limited generalization due to their reliance on specific data structures and fixed denoising methods that cannot adapt to changing scenarios. By deeply analyzing the relationship between training data structures and representations, combined with deep learning approaches[6\u20138], we can mitigate these limitations. Generative augmentation methods, utilizing the data\u2019s implicit space, can improve classification performance and reduce false alarm rates in \u03a6-OTDR systems. In this paper, we reduce \u03a6-OTDR event classification to two key tasks: data augmentation for laboratory datasets and high-dimensional data representation learning. Under practical circumstances, the sensing data of \u03a6-OTDR systems are high-dimensional time series with strong dependencies. To handle such high-dimensional data, we propose a Riemannian manifold-based data augmentation method for \u03a6-OTDR data and a complete development process for industrial event classification models[9, 10]. We construct the TransformDAS model as a representative, and experiments demonstrate that this model exhibits better training stability and the highest accuracy in real-world industrial environments. \u2022 A method for high-dimensional data augmentation is developed to ensure the generalization ability of classifi- cation models based on the specificities of \u03a6-OTDR data and actual engineering needs. \u2022 Emphasis is placed on learning the implicit space in- formation of data, quantifying its influence on model classification decisions. \u2022 A TransformDAS model is proposed based on the trans- former framework to handle high-dimensional, time- series data with strong dependencies. \u2022 Quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, enabling models to easily address the recognition and classification tasks of six typical intrusion events and related mixed events in the DAS domain. II. APPROACH A. Problem Definition In industrial intrusion event detection, classification models identify various events\u2014such as human and vehicle intru- sions or excavation activities\u2014by analyzing continuous spatio- temporal signal data from fiber optic sensors. These events exhibit unique frequency, amplitude, and temporal patterns, arXiv:2502.02428v1 [cs.LG] 4 Feb 2025"
