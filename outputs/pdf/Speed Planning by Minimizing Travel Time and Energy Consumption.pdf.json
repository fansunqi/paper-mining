  "abstract": "In this paper we address the speed planning problem for a vehicle over an assigned path with the aim of minimizing a weighted sum of travel time and energy consumption under suitable constraints (maximum allowed speed, maximum traction or braking force, maximum power con- sumption). The resulting mathematical model is a non\u2013convex optimization problem. We prove that, under some mild assumptions, a convex reformulation of the non\u2013convex problem is exact. In particular, the convex reformulation is a Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, for which efficient solvers exist. Through the numerical experiments we confirm that the convex relaxation can be solved very efficiently and, moreover, we also provide the Pareto front of the trade-off between the two objectives (travel time and energy consumption).

In this scenario, one relevant problem is the optimization of the speed of a road vehicle on an assigned path. In this paper, we present an efficient method for minimizing a weighted average of travel time and energy consumption. Figure 1 shows the basic problem setting. We consider a vehicle on a road with a known elevation profile \u03b3(s) and slope \u03b1(s), where s is the arc-length position on the travelled curve. We want to find the speed law that optimizes a weighted sum of the travel time and the overall used energy. We take into account maximum speed constraints along the path, forces dissipated by aerodynamic effects and tyre rolling resistance, no slipping constraints, and constraints on the maximum available power. In more detail, we consider the following optimization problem, which is the discretized version of a \u2217All authors are with the University of Parma, Department of Engineering and Architecture, Parco Area delle Scienze 181/A, 43124 Parma, Italy.
