  "abstract": "Pontremoli\u201d, University of Milan, via Celoria 16, 20133 Milan, Italy. An analytical theory for the random close packing density, \u03d5RCP, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of \u03d5RCP as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean s. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at s = 0.246, the theory yields \u03d5RCP = 0.892, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate \u03d5RCP = 0.905 based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)]. The hard-sphere (HS) system is a standard paradigm in statistical physics, and has proved invaluable in under- standing the microscopic structure of condensed matter, in particular liquids and crystals. The absence of interac- tions apart from a hard-core repulsion makes it amenable to analytical treatments to accurately describe its equa- tion of state, and allows precise numerical calculations of its phase behaviour. The latter is governed only by the filling fraction \u03d5 and not by a temperature, unlike other standard models of statistical mechanics. An equilibrium compression of the HS fluid leads to an entropy-driven first-order freezing phase transition [1\u20133], a paradigmatic example that catches the essential features of freezing in most simple liquids [4]. Eventually, compression leads to a close-packed configuration that optimally fills space at close-packing (CP), \u03d5CP. If the compression is applied rapidly to the system, the equilibrium freezing is avoided, and the largest achievable density shifts to a value lower than \u03d5CP as particles randomly \u201cjam\u201d in a disordered configuration, accompanied by the divergence of pres- sure [5\u20137]. The maximum packing fraction achieved in this disordered state is known as the random close pack- ing (RCP) volume fraction, \u03d5RCP [8\u201310]. All these facts hold for monodisperse spheres in d = 3. In d = 2, the physics of hard disks presents some fundamental differences. While the Mermin-Wagner- Hohenberg argument appears to rule out long-range or- der in 2D, the first computer simulations showed that the hard disk fluid undergoes crystallization [1]. The work of Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless (BKT) [11\u201313] was motivated by this apparent contradiction and con- clusively showed the existence of a crystalline phase also in 2D, with quasi-long range order, i.e. power-law de- cay of spatial correlations. The freezing of equilibrium monodisperse hard disks occurs via a two-step mecha- nism: first a liquid-hexatic transition around \u03d5 \u22480.72, closely followed by a transition from the hexatic phase to a triangular crystal. The original BKT theory pre- dicts that both transitions are continuous, in agreement with the first experimental verification of the BKT sce- nario using superparamagnetic colloids interacting via a long-range dipolar potential [14, 15]. However, subse- quent evidence from numerical simulations suggests that the liquid-hexatic transition is first-order [16\u201318], while more complex scenarios have been reported for the 2D melting of multi-component mixtures [19]. In d = 2, a broad range of \u03d5RCP \u22480.81 \u22120.89 has been reported using different algorithms and theories [9, 20\u201325], the upper bound of which is quite close to the CP value, \u03d5CP = \u03c0/ \u221a 12 \u22480.9069 (for comparison, in 3D, \u03d5RCP \u22480.64 \u22120.65 and \u03d5CP = \u03c0/ \u221a 18 \u22480.7404). This proximity between \u03d5CP and \u03d5RCP makes it harder to avoid crystallization, to the point that some methods to generate disordered packings miss it altogether in 2D [26]. As importantly pointed out in [27], while \u03d5CP is un- ambiguously defined as the largest achievable filling frac- tion, \u03d5RCP is not. In particular, slight changes to the compression procedure may change the observed range of values [28]. Yet, one may introduce well-defined spe- cial packings, that are most disordered for a given choice of order metric, e.g. the bond-orientational order pa- rameter [27], which leads to the well-defined concept of maximally random jammed (MRJ) states [29]. Alternatively, in fast compressions, RCP is the lowest volume fraction at which the static (low-frequency) shear modulus rises from zero. For the jamming of soft repul- sive particles, the non-affine analytical theory of the shear modulus value shows that this is tantamount to requiring that RCP is isostatic, meaning that the average number of contacts z of a particle at RCP verifies z = 2d [30], in agreement with numerical observations with various dy- namics [28, 31, 32]. Defining RCP as the densest isostatic packing, an analytical estimate for \u03d5RCP can be obtained for monodisperse hard spheres in both 2D and 3D, using arXiv:2502.03354v1 [cond-mat.soft] 5 Feb 2025"
