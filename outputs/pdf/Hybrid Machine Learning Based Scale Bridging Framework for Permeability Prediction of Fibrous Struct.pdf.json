  "title": "Hybrid Machine Learning Based Scale Bridging Framework for Permeability Prediction of Fibrous Struct.pdf",
  "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid machine learning-based scale-bridging frame- work for predicting the permeability of fibrous textile structures. By addressing the computational challenges inherent to multiscale modeling, the proposed ap- proach evaluates the efficiency and accuracy of different scale-bridging method- ologies combining traditional surrogate models and even integrating physics- informed neural networks (PINNs) with numerical solvers, enabling accurate permeability predictions across micro- and mesoscales. Four methodologies were evaluated: Single Scale Method (SSM), Simple Upscaling Method (SUM), Scale- Bridging Method (SBM), and Fully Resolved Model (FRM). SSM, the simplest method, neglects microscale permeability and exhibited permeability values de- viating by up to 150% of the FRM model, which was taken as ground truth at an equivalent lower fiber volume content. SUM improved predictions by con- sidering uniform microscale permeability, yielding closer values under similar conditions, but still lacked structural variability. The SBM method, incorpo- rating segment-based microscale permeability assignments, showed significant enhancements, achieving almost equivalent values while maintaining compu- Preprint submitted to Elsevier February 10, 2025 arXiv:2502.05044v1 [cs.LG] 7 Feb 2025"
