  "abstract": ". We discuss the relationship between o-minimality and the so called Zilber- Pink conjecture. Since the work of Pila and Zannier, algebraization theorems in o- minimal geometry had profound impacts in Diophantine geometry (most notably on the study of special points in abelian and Shimura varieties). We will \ufb01rst focus on functional transcendence, discussing various recent and spectacular Ax-Schanuel theorems, and the related geometric part of Zilber-Pink. Armed with these tools, we will study the distribution of the Hodge locus of an arbitrary variation of Hodge structures (the typical/atypical dichotomy) and present some recent applications. We will conclude by describing the algebraicity and quasiprojectivity of images of period maps. In memory of Nicola Gatti (1990\u20132023), whose boundless curiosity and passion for schemes would have made him a treasured reader. Contents Preface 2 1. Lecture 1: (Historical) Overview 5 2.
