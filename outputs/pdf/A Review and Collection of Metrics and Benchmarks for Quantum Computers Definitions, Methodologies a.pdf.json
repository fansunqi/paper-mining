  "title": "A Review and Collection of Metrics and Benchmarks for Quantum Computers Definitions, Methodologies a.pdf",
  "abstract": "Quantum computers have the potential to provide an advantage over classical computers in a number of areas. The quest towards such quantum advantage has required the development of methods to benchmark the performance of quantum computers against classical computers as well as the relative performance of dif- ferent quantum computing platforms. This is a challenging task, firstly due to the large diversity of hardware platforms, and secondly due to the emergence of two different approaches to quantum computing, one being a gate-based approach for universal quantum computation, and the other an analogue approach tailored to outperforming classical computers for specific tasks. Numerous metrics to benchmark the performance of quantum computers, ranging from their individual hardware components to entire applications, have been proposed over the years. Navigating the resulting extensive literature can be overwhelming. Objective com- parisons are further hampered in practice as different variations of the same metric are used, and the data disclosed together with a reported metric value is often not sufficient to reproduce the measurements. This article addresses these challenges by providing a review of metrics and benchmarks for quantum computers and 1) a comprehensive collection of benchmarks allowing holistic comparisons of quantum computers, 2) a consistent format of the definitions across all metrics including a transparent description of the methodology and of the main assumptions and limitations, and 3) a reproducible approach by linking the metrics to open-source software used to evaluate them. The benchmarks span aspects of a device such as architec- tural properties, quality, speed, and stability, and also include metrics tailored to several non-gate-based architectures. Quantum computing technology has reached the stage where a number of methods for performance char- acterization are backed by a large body of real-world implementation and use, as well as by theoretical proofs. These mature benchmarking methods will benefit from commonly agreed-upon approaches. Indeed, such agreement is the only way to fairly, unambiguously, and objectively benchmark quantum computers across manufacturers. However, there are also benchmarking techniques that are still significantly evolving and for which standardization would be premature. We identify five areas where international standardiza- tion working groups could be established, namely: i) the identification and agreement on the categories of metrics that comprehensively benchmark device performance; ii) the identification and agreement on a set of well-established metrics that together comprehensively benchmark performance; iii) the identification of metrics specific to hardware platforms, including non-gate-based quantum computers; iv) inter-laboratory comparison studies to develop best practice guides for measurement methodology; and v) agreement on what data and software should be reported together with a metric value to ensure trust, transparency and reproducibility. We provide potential routes to advancing these areas, thereby contributing to accelerate the progress of quantum computing hardware towards quantum advantage. \u2217These authors contributed equally \u2020ivan.rungger@npl.co.uk 1"
