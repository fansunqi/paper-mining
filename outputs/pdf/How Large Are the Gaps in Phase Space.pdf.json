Hermite) functions, we provide quantitative upper bounds on the radius of any ball that does not intersect the support of the measure. The estimates depend on the condition number, i.e., the ratio of the sampling constants, but are independent of the structure of the measure. Our proofs are completely elementary and rely on explicit formulas for the respective transforms. Index Terms\u2014sampling measures, wavelet transform, short- time Fourier transform, frames. I. INTRODUCTION This article draws inspiration from the paper \u2019How large are the spectral gaps?\u2019 by Iosevich and Pedersen [12], as well as the recent work by Papageorgiu and van Velthoven [19], who gave quantitative estimates for relative denseness for exponential frames and coherent frames on groups of polynomial growth, respectively. The main objective of this paper is to obtain a similar result for the wavelet transform using a speci\ufb01c family of orthogonal functions as wavelets. In particular, we establish an upper bound on the radius of any ball in wavelet phase space that does not intersect the support of a sampling measure. Our proof follows a different approach than [19] since the (ax + b)-group underlying the wavelet transform exhibits exponential growth. In addition, we discuss sampling measures for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and provide a bound which, in principle, could readily be obtained using the ideas of [19]. Given that the proof strategy closely mirrors that of the wavelet transform and that our elementary approach provides explicit constants, we chose to include the statement in this article. Let (X, \u03bd) be a metric measure space and H be a closed subspace of L2(X, \u03bd). A measure \u00b5 on X is called a sampling measure if there are constants A, B > 0 s.t. A\u2225F\u22252 L2\u03bd \u2264 Z X |F(z)|2d\u00b5(z) \u2264B\u2225F\u22252 L2\u03bd, F \u2208H. As we already pointed out, we focus on the cases when H is the range of the wavelet transform or of the STFT. A measure \u00b5 is called (\u03b3, R)-dense if \u00b5(BR(z)) \u2265\u03b3 > 0 for every z \u2208X, and relatively dense if there exist R > 0 and \u03b3 > 0 s.t. \u00b5 is (\u03b3, R)-dense. There are various qualitative and quantitative results relating sampling measures and relative denseness. For one, it is well- known that the support of a sampling measure for the wavelet transform as well as the STFT is necessarily relatively dense, see, e.g., [7], [14], [16], [18]. If a sampling measure for the STFT is discrete, i.e., \u00b5 = P \u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03b4\u03bb with \u039b \u2282R2d discrete, then the density theorem for Gabor frames provides a more re\ufb01ned analysis assuring that the lower Beurling density of \u039b is greater or equal than one for every window function [11]. For the wavelet transform, however, no such general result is known and all existing density statements either require a particular structure of the sampling points and / or choice of the wavelet function [5], [20], [22], [23]. See [15] for a discussion of the dif\ufb01culties that occur in this setting. Previous quantitative results on relative denseness primarily focused on estimates of the sampling constants A and B in terms of R and \u03b3. This approach was studied, e.g., in [4], [6], [10], [13] for \u00b5 = \u03c7\u2126\u03bd (here \u03c7\u2126denotes the characteristic function of a measurable set \u2126), or in [24] for a discrete measure \u00b5 leading to explicit frame bounds. Here, we study the converse problem of providing an upper bound on R in terms of A and B given that \u00b5 is not (\u03b3, R)-dense. We prove our main estimates in Theorem 3 for a family of orthogonal wavelets \u03c8\u03b1 n, n \u2208N0, \u03b1 > 0, de\ufb01ned in Fourier domain in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials (see equation (4)). The ranges of the respective wavelet transforms play important roles in various \ufb01elds as they may be identi\ufb01ed with Bergman spaces of analytic functions on the upper half- plane and the unit disk (n = 0), and with hyperbolic Landau level spaces in quantum mechanics, see [1], [2], [6] for detailed discussions of these connections. It seems that the statement of Theorem 3 was previously unknown, even in the literature on Bergman spaces. The only result, that we are aware of, that exhibits a conceptual similarity, is [21, Lemma 4.1]. Our proofs follow the general strategy developed in [12] and rely on explicit formulas of the wavelet transform and the STFT. This approach allowed us to derive elementary bounds on the quotient of, e.g., two wavelet transforms z 7\u2192W\u03c8\u03b1 n \u03c8\u03b1 0 (z)/W\u03c8\u03b1 n\u03c8\u03b1 0 (w\u22121 \u00b7 z), z, w \u2208C+, z \u0338= w, on certain regions in phase space which is then partitioned accordingly. II. SAMPLING MEASURES FOR THE WAVELET TRANSFORM A. Basic Wavelet Theory We use the standard notation H2(C+) for the Hardy space of analytic functions in C+ equipped with the norm \u2225f\u22252 H2 := sup 0<s<\u221e Z \u221e \u2212\u221e |f(x + is)|2 dx < \u221e."
