  "abstract": "Special functions are essential in theoretical and applied mathematics and have various applications in the applied sciences. Mathematicians have studied them for centuries, but there is still no bibliometric analysis that summarises the datasets of publications showing different network visualisations, such as co-author and keyword visualisations, basic keyword statistics and other data analyses. This work appears to be the first attempt to fill this gap by presenting different network visualisations based on 4025 documents with the keyword \u201dspecial function\u201d in their title, abstract or keywords belonging to the field of mathematics in the Scopus database. We also show that special functions are rarely used in geometric modelling, a mathematical foundation for CAD, industrial design, architecture, and other applied fields, and we discuss how different visualisations for special functions can be generated in the Julia programming language. The generated image and video visualisations can be helpful to academics to see the impact of different authors, to define their new research topics, to see connections or lack thereof between various topics, to find the most popular special functions, or for teaching purposes to show the importance of special functions and links to other topics in modern pure and applied mathematics and other sciences. KEYWORDS Special function; visualisation; network; visual analytics; keyword analysis; co-authorship; VOSviewer; Scopus database 1. Introduction Special functions [1\u20133] play an essential role in theoretical and applied mathematics and have various applications in applied sciences, such as different engineering fields: information theory, image processing, aesthetic shape modelling, computer simulation, etc. Mathematicians have studied them for several centuries, but there is still no biblio- metric analysis that summarises the datasets of related publications showing different network visualisations, such as co-author and keyword visualisations, basic keyword statistics and other data analyses. This work seems to be the first attempt to fill this gap by presenting different network visualisations based on 4025 Scopus-indexed docu- CONTACT Rushan Ziatdinov.
