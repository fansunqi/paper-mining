  "abstract": "\u2014Networked systems are susceptible to cascading failures, where the failure of an initial set of nodes propagates through the network, often leading to system-wide failures. In this work, we propose a multiplex flow network model to study robustness against cascading failures triggered by random failures. The model is inspired by systems where nodes carry or support multiple types of flows, and failures result in the redistribution of flows within the same layer rather than be- tween layers. To represent different types of interdependencies between the layers of the multiplex network, we define two cases of failure conditions: layer-independent overload and layer- influenced overload. We provide recursive equations and their solutions to calculate the steady-state fraction of surviving nodes, validate them through a set of simulation experiments, and discuss optimal load-capacity allocation strategies. Our results demonstrate that allocating the total excess capacity to each layer proportional to the mean effective load in the layer and distributing that excess capacity equally among the nodes within the layer ensures maximum robustness. The proposed framework for different failure conditions allows us to analyze the two overload conditions presented and can be extended to explore more complex interdependent relationships.

INTRODUCTION N ETWORKED systems, ranging from power distribution to transportation, are integral to many aspects of modern life. These networks rarely operate in isolation; instead, usu- ally there are significant interdependencies between different systems. For example, transportation networks, which include multiple modes of transport, depend on each other as well as the underlying communication and power networks. In the event of an attack or random failures in an interdependent system, the failures in one of the networks can cause failures of the dependent nodes in the other networks and vice versa. This process may continue in a recursive manner, triggering a cascade of failures that can potentially collapse an entire system, often referred as \u201ccascading failures\u201d [1]. Notable examples of this vulnerability are the large-scale blackouts caused by minor failures in power supply networks worldwide [2]\u2013[4]. Yet, such failures are not unique to power grids; rather, they span a variety of application domains such as supply chain management [5], [6], natural disaster relief operations O. \u02d9Irsoy and O.

Given its relevance across numerous domains, the robust- ness of interdependent networks against cascading failures has been an active research field, particularly after the seminal paper of Buldyrev et al. [1]. However, existing works on cascading failures in interdependent networks usually focus on percolation-based models [1], [12]\u2013[16]. In this model a node can function only if it belongs to the largest connected (i.e., gi- ant) component of its own network; nodes that lose their con- nection to this giant core are considered failed. Such models are particularly suitable for studying computer/communication networks where connectivity is the fundamental focus of the robustness analysis. Many real-world systems, however, are tasked with transporting physical commodities or flows; e.g., power networks, transportation networks, supply-chain networks, financial networks, etc. In such flow networks, failure of nodes often lead to redistribution of their load to the functional nodes, potentially overloading and failing them. For example, failure of a node in a transportation network would distribute the current passenger load to surviving nodes, po- tentially causing congestion. Similarly, in a financial network, the bankruptcy of a company would impose a financial burden on related businesses, potentially triggering a propagation of failures across the network. Thus, the dynamics of failures in such cases is governed primarily by flow redistribution rather than the structural changes in the network. Robustness of flow networks has recently received attention, with the focus being primarily on single networks [17]\u2013 [21] or multiple interconnected networks where flow can be redistributed from one network to another [22]\u2013[25]. However, the assumption of load redistribution between layers does not account for scenarios where redistribution is confined within individual layers, even though node failure is determined by its flows across all layers. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work on the robustness of multiplex flow networks, where a set of nodes carry or support multiple distinct commodities or functionalities, each through a distinct network layer, and where the failure condition of a node is intricately tied to its set of loads across all layers. Such systems encompass a wide range of real-life examples, including management systems where each working unit is assigned multiple tasks, cloud computing systems where individual computing units support different functionalities such as CPU, GPU, and memory, or financial networks where institutions employ different financial instruments; see Section II for a arXiv:2502.06159v1 [eess.SY] 10 Feb 2025"
