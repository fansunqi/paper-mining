  "abstract": "The impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the evolution of galaxies explains the steep decrease in the number density of the most massive galaxies in the Universe. However, the fueling of the AGN and the efficiency of this feedback largely depend on their environment. We use data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 to make the first study of the orientations of radio jets and their optical counterpart in relation to the cosmic web environment. We find that close to filaments (\u227211 Mpc), galaxies tend to have their optical major axes aligned with the nearest filaments. On the other hand, radio jets, which are generally aligned perpendicularly to the optical major axis of the host galaxy, show more randomised orientations with respect to host galaxies within \u22728 Mpc of filaments. These results support the scenario that massive galaxies in cosmic filaments grow by numerous mergers directed along the orientation of the filaments while experiencing chaotic accretion of gas onto the central black hole. The AGN-driven jets consequently have a strong impact preferentially along the minor axes of dark matter halos within filaments. We discuss the implications of these results for large-scale radio jet alignments, intrinsic alignments between galaxies, and the azimuthal anisotropy of the distribution of circumgalactic medium and anisotropic quenching.

As the strong gravity field around a SMBH accretes surrounding interstellar material onto the black hole, large amounts of energy can be released producing active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. It is thought that AGN accretion occurs in two different modes, resulting in two different classes of AGN. The first is \u2018jet mode\u2019 AGN, which accretes inefficiently from pockets of cold gas in the hot gas halo and emits the bulk of its power as a radio jet. The second is the radiatively efficient \u2018radiative mode\u2019 sources typical of optical or X-ray selected AGN, which accretes efficiently from cold gas and may or may not have a radio jet (e.g. Heckman & Best 2014). Galaxy formation models invoke feedback from such AGN to cur- tail the amount of star formation in massive galaxies and match the observed galaxy stellar mass function (e.g. Bower et al. 2006; Cro- ton et al. 2006; Bower et al. 2017; Adams et al. 2021; McLeod et al. 2021). This feedback is often prescribed as two related processes that are implemented in recent cosmological-volume galaxy formation simulations, albeit with slightly different prescriptions (e.g. Schaye et al. 2015; Dubois et al. 2016; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2019). First, the radiative feedback from the hard ionisation field emanating from the accretion \u2605e-mail: lyla.jung@physics.ox.ac.uk disk provides a heating mechanism for the surrounding gas, prevent- ing it from cooling and condensing into cold gas necessary for star formation; the second mechanism arises from the generation of jet outflows, which can drive gas away from the host galaxy via me- chanical feedback (e.g. Heckman et al. 2024). These AGN jets may also have an impact on galaxy groups and clusters (e.g. Fabian 2012; McNamara & Nulsen 2012) potentially stimulating or truncating star formation within galaxies in such environments (Rawlings & Jarvis 2004; Hatch et al. 2014). However, such a clear distinction between \u2018radiative\u2019 and \u2018me- chanical\u2019 feedback modes is possibly not completely correct. Many AGN that have both bright optical nuclei and broad line regions, which are the hallmark of the radiative mode, also produce power- ful radio emission, traditionally termed radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies (see Urry & Padovani 1995, for a review). Furthermore, although large samples of bright radio sources tend to exhibit a bi- modal distribution in their Eddington-scaled accretion rate, (Best & Heckman 2012; Mingo et al. 2014), more recent work using deeper radio data suggests that this bimodal distribution disappears towards lower radio luminosities (Whittam et al. 2018, 2022). The relation- ship between the accretion rate and the generation of jets responsible for the mechanical feedback in these systems is therefore a critical aspect in enhancing our understanding of the role of AGN in galaxy evolution. Theoretical models of AGN jet formation suggest that the jets \u00a9 0000 The Authors arXiv:2502.03730v1 [astro-ph.GA] 6 Feb 2025"
