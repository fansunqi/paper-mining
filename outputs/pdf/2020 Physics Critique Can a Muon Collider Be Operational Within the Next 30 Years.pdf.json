  "title": "2020 Physics Critique Can a Muon Collider Be Operational Within the Next 30 Years.pdf",
  "abstract": "Muon colliders are a proposed next-generation particle accelerator which benefit from the muon\u2019s fundamentality and relatively high mass to perform simultaneous high precision, high energy experiments. This critique reviews their physics potential and technological feasibility, then proposes a roadmap for how a 3 TeV muon collider could be built, concluding that it is experimentally possible for a muon collider to be operational in 30 years. 1 Introduction This critical review will assess available evidence to answer the question of whether muon colliders can be operational by 2050. Decisions on the next high energy accelerator after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are being considered by the high energy physics community, facilitated by the European Particle Physics Strategy Update 2020. Proposed accelerator designs were presented at the Open Symposium in May 2019, and by May 2020, the European Strategy Group (ESG) will have reviewed these proposals and will provide advice on which ex- periments should be considered priority for further research and development (R&D) over the next 7 years. This strategy group is composed of scientific delegates from major European laboratories and representatives from CERN member states. This review will take the position of the ESG to look at available evidence on recent progress of muon colliders, such as that presented within Section 10.4 of the ESG briefbook [1]. Other next-generation accelerators proposed in the briefbook, such as FCC, a circular electron collider, and CLIC, a linear electron collider, are focusing on producing Higgs bosons in order to measure the Higgs resonance peak. This review will conclude that the muon collider has better potential in measuring the Higgs resonance than these options and functions as a high energy discovery machine in addition. After this, the major technological components of a muon collider will be reviewed, to determine if they can be available within 30 years. Sufficient physics motivation and technological availability is required to conclude that muon colliders can be operational by 2050, and this conclusion assumes there are no significant financial or political difficulties. 2 Motivation The motivations and physics benefits of a muon collider must justify the high costs associated with the R&D and technological difficulty. The major motivations for building a muon collider have been summarised by the Muon Collider Working Group, who produced a short document contributing to the ESG [2]. There are two properties of a muon which provide these benefits: their point-like nature, and their mass of 105.66 MeV, which is heavy relative to an electron [3]. 1 arXiv:2502.13781v1 [physics.acc-ph] 19 Feb 2025"
