  "abstract": "Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phe- nomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different ef- fective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilin- ear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscilla- tors, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonre- ciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmis- sion. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear peri- odic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilat- eral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonre- ciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperi- odic response characteristics. 1 Introduction It is generally preferred in engineering to design vibrat- ing machines and devices to operate in the linear regime, where their behavior is more easily predictable. Non- linearity, within this framework, is often associated with unwanted complexity. However, nonlinearity is unavoid- able in several engineering systems such as systems with friction joints or clearances [1, 2]. On the other hand, \u2217Department of Mechanical, Industrial & Aerospace En- gineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, H3G1M8, Canada(ali.kogani@mail.concordia.ca) \u2020Department of Mechanical, Industrial & Aerospace En- gineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, H3G1M8, Canada(behrooz.yousefzadeh@concordia.ca) nonlinearity can be introduced intentionally to a vibrat- ing system with the goal of achieving new response char- acteristics [3, 4, 5]. There is therefore a need to under- stand the nonlinear behavior of vibrating systems from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Nonlinearity can originate from the material proper- ties of a system (material nonlinearity) [6], from large deformations (geometrical nonlinearity) [7] or from the interaction force between multiple sub-systems such as friction in joints (contact nonlinearity) [1]. In this work, we focus on a particular type of nonlinearity known as bilinear elasticity or bilinear stiffness. Bilinear stiffness refers to a system characteristic where the effective elasticity changes at a certain degree of elastic deformation, exhibiting one stiffness value up to a threshold called the offset, and a different stiffness value beyond that threshold. This unique nonlinearity can be found in systems such as a cracked beam [8], in vibro-impact drilling systems [9], or in systems with in- termittent contact [10, 11]. Systems featuring bilinear elasticity are known for their non-smooth behavior (sud- den change between two states), leading to intricate non- linear dynamic response characteristics [12]. Vibration systems with bilinear stiffness may exhibit unique dy- namic behavior not readily found in other types of non- linearity. Therefore, it is important to understand the associated dynamics and vibration transmission charac- teristics of such systems. The study of bilinear stiffness and its impact on the vibration characteristics of mechanical systems has a long history [13, 14, 15, 16]. Extensive research has explored various aspects of vibration characteristics influenced by bilinear stiffness and damping [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In this work, we focus on a response characteristic that can be triggered effectively by bilinear stiffness: unilateral transmission. Unilateral transmission is a response characteristic where the transmitted wave remains purely in tension or compression; i.e., the corresponding deformations from the static equilibrium position remain consistently pos- itive or negative. Lu and Norris [23] were the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate unilateral 1 arXiv:2502.08726v1 [nlin.PS] 12 Feb 2025"
