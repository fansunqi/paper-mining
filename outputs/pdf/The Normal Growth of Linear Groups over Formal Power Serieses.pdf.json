  "title": "The Normal Growth of Linear Groups over Formal Power Serieses.pdf",
  "abstract": ". Put R = Fp[[t1, . . . , td]]). We estimate the number of normal subgroups of SL1 2(Fp[[t1, . . . , td]]) for p > 2, the number of ideals in the Lie algebra sl2(R), and the number of ideals in the associative algebra R. 1. Introduction and results For a group G and an integer n let sn(G) be the number of subgroups of index n, and s\u22b3 n(G) be the number of normal subgroups of index n. For a Lie algebra L over Fp we let sn(L) be the number of ideals of index n (that is the codimension c satis\ufb01es pc = n). For a ring R let s\u22b3 n(R) be the number of ideals of index n. For a d-generated group G (discrete or pro\ufb01nite), Lubotzky [4] showed that s\u22b3 n(G) \u2264n2(d+1)(1+\u2126(n)), where \u2126(n) denotes the number of prime divisors of n, counted with multiplicity. Mann [6] showed that for the free pro-p group with 2 generators bF we have s\u22b3 pk( bF) \u2265pck2 for some positive constant c. In particular, Lubotzky\u2019s bound is sharp up to a constant. By now we also know that the lower bound s\u22b3 pk(G) \u2265pck2 holds for many groups, including all Golod-Shafarevich groups [2]. We know that the normal growth of a group is quite irregular. This is already indicated by Lubotzky\u2019s bound, which depends heavily on the number theoretic properties of n. It also follows from the fact that s\u22b3 n(\u0393) is polynomially bounded for all n with the exception of a set of density 0 (see [7]). Furthermore if there exists a monotonic function f, such that for all \u01eb > 0 and all x we have |s\u22b3 n(\u0393)\u2212f(n)| < \u01ebf(n) for all n \u2264x with at most \u01ebx exceptions, then f is asymptotically equal to 0 or 1, see [8]. When considering normal growth it therefore makes little sense to look at strict asymptotics but at weaker equivalence relations among functions. A common measure is the type of a function. For a function g : N \u2192R we say that a function f : N \u2192R is of type g, if there exists a constant C, such that f(n) < g(n)C holds for all n, and f(n)C > g(n) holds for in\ufb01nitely many n. Note that type does not de\ufb01ne an equivalence relation. For example, the function f which satis\ufb01es f(2k) = 2k for all k, and f(n) = 0 for all n that are not a power of 2, is of type n, but the function g(n) = n is not of type f. On the lower end of the spectrum there are many groups which have logarithmic normal growth. In fact, for many pro-p groups the number of normal subgroup of any given index is bounded. We refer the reader to [1] for results on and examples of such groups. We also know many examples of polynomial normal growth, including all p-adic analytic groups which are not of logarithmic growth. In fact, if G is p- adic analytic, Grunewald, Segal and Smith [3] showed that P s\u22b3 n(G)p\u2212s is a rational function. If this function has a pole with positive real part, the normal growth is 1"
