  "abstract": "The magnetic field within the blazar jet plays a crucial role in shaping these effects, with its strength in the emission region being an important parameter determined by multi-wavelength observations. However, the origin of the high energy bump observed in the spectral energy distribution of some blazars is a topic of debate, with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios providing plausible explanations that result in different magnetic field strengths in the emission region. In this study, we investigate the impact of magnetic field configurations on the constraints of ALP parameters. We consider both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios for the blazar Mrk 501 and derive the corresponding jet magnetic field strengths. Additionally, we explore two jet magnetic field models: one with a toroidal component and the other with helical and tangled components. By analyzing the spectra of Mrk 501 observed by MAGIC and Fermi-LAT from 2017-06-17 to 2019-07-23, which are well-described by both emission scenarios, we derive constraints on the ALP parameters. Our results demonstrate that both the emission scenario and the magnetic field structure play a significant role in deriving these constraints, with the hadronic model leading to much more stringent limits compared to the leptonic model. I. INTRODUCTION Axion was originally proposed in connection with a solu- tion to the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1\u20134]. Another type of pseudo scalar particle similar to axions but with independent coupling and mass parame- ters is known as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) [5]. The exis- tence of ALP has been predicted by theories beyond the Stan- dard Model, such as string theory [6\u20138]. Compared to axions, ALPs offer a broader parameter space for exploration. The coupling between ALP and photon is extremely weak. However, astrophysical observations provide an excellent op- portunity to detect ALP effects due to the long propagation distances involved. As photons travel through magnetic fields, they can oscillate into ALPs and and back along their trajec- tory [9]. This ALP-photon oscillation effect can induce spec- tral irregularities that are potentially detectable by high energy \u03b3-ray detectors. With recent advancements, experiments such as Fermi-LAT [10], MAGIC [11], HAWC [12], and LHAASO [13], have achieved the capability to conduct precise measure- ments of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from high en- ergy astrophysical sources, providing important data for ALP searches. Numerous studies have explored this phenomenon, yielding a multitude of constraints on ALP parameters [14\u2013 38]. Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are widely studied in ALP searches due to their prominence in the high energy \u03b3-ray extragalactic sky. These sources har- bor supermassive black holes surrounded by accretion disks and generate relativistic jets oriented towards Earth. Photons emitted from the emission region of a blazar may undergo \u2217gaolq@csust.edu.cn \u2020 lwb@usc.edu.cn conversion into ALPs within the magnetic field of the jet and potentially revert back into photons within the Galactic mag- netic field. However, many astrophysical magnetic fields are not precisely determined, leading to uncertainties in the con- straints on ALP parameters. In the case of blazars, the primary source of uncertainty lies in the blazar jet magnetic field (BJMF). Many previous studies have employed a BJMF model dominated by a toroidal field [22, 24, 25, 29, 35, 39\u201341], where the field strength is propor- tional to the magnetic field strength in the emission region, denoted as B0, and inversely proportional to the distance from the central black hole. Given that B0 is determined through multi-wavelength spectral fitting and is correlated with other parameters, such as the jet\u2019s Doppler factor, it is essential to simultaneously vary these parameters in the analysis. The impact of variations in these parameters on ALP con- straints is studied in Ref. [42], where the multi-wavelength observations of Mrk 421, well-matched by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, are considered. Within the lep- tonic scenario [42\u201344], the high energy peak of the SED is attributed to inverse Compton scattering. However, the ori- gin of this high energy peak remains under debate for some blazars, with hadronic models providing an alternative expla- nation. In the hadronic scenario, the high energy component can be attributed to proton synchrotron emission, or emissions from secondary particles generated in photohadronic (p\u03b3) and hadronuclear (pp) interactions. Since leptonic and hadronic models predict different values for the magnetic field strength B0, this introduces additional uncertainty in ALP constraints. Consequently, in this work, we aim to examine the differences in constraints derived from the leptonic and hadronic models. In this study, we utilize the high energy \u03b3-ray spectrum of Mrk 501 during its low-activity period, observed by Fermi- LAT and MAGIC from 2017-06-17 to 2019-07-23, to investi- gate the ALP-photon oscillation. Mrk 501, a blazar with a red- shift of 0.034 [45], is classified as a high synchrotron peaked arXiv:2501.18860v1 [astro-ph.HE] 31 Jan 2025"
