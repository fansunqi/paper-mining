  "abstract": "This orbital current can be efficiently injected into an adjacent nonmagnetic material (NM) without being hampered by electrical conductivity mismatch. However, experimentally identifying this novel effect presents significant challenges due to the substantial background contributions from spin pumping and spin rectification effects (SREs). In this work, we disentangle the effects of orbital pumping from spin pumping in bilayer structures composed of Nb/Ni and Nb/Fe60Co20B20 by observing a sign reversal of the measured voltage. This reversal arises from the competing signs of the spin and orbital Hall effects in the Nb. We establish methods to differentiate the pumping signal from SREs by analyzing the distinct angular dependence of the measured voltage and its spatial dependence relative to the radio frequency excitation source. INTRODUCTION Spin and orbital angular momentum are two funda- mental properties of electrons, interconnected through spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In spintronics, the SOC is essential in the emergence of various intriguing physi- cal phenomena [1] such as stabilization of chiral magen- tic skyrmions [2\u20135] and spin current generation mech- anisms [6]. The study of spin currents (JS), including those generated via the spin Hall effect (SHE) [7\u201310] and the Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) [11, 12], has been a central focus in spintronics, especially due to its poten- tial applications in nonvolatile magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) [13, 14]. Recent interest has shifted toward the generation of orbital currents (JO) due to its potential applications in energy efficient MRAM technology [15, 16]. Theoreti- cal studies suggest that orbital current is a fundamental entity that can for instance result in spin current lever- aging the SOC of materials [16\u201318]. A major advantage of orbital currents is their potential to be orders of mag- nitude larger than spin currents across a wide range of materials [19], as they are not inherently limited by the relativistic SOC. Consequently, orbital currents could overcome the limitations of spin currents, particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency, making them highly promising for memory and logic applications [16]. Thus far, the emerging field of orbitronics has mainly focused on the generation of JO through the orbital Hall effect (OHE) [20\u201327] and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) [28\u201332]. Recently, theorists have pre- dicted the effect of \"orbital pumping\", where a precess- ing magnet can emit a significant orbital current with- out requiring an associated electric current (Figure 1 (a)) [33\u201335]. This effect is analogous to the previously demonstrated spin pumping effect, where a precessing magnet emits pure spin current [36\u201341] (Figure 1 (b)). Both spin and orbital pumping provide methods to generate spin and orbital currents without the chal- lenges posed by electrical conductivity mismatch and enable easy and clear detection in comparatively simple samples [42]. As illustrated in Figure 1 (a,b), the emit- ted orbital and spin currents are converted into a trans- verse voltage in the adjacent nonmagnet via reciprocal effects known as the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE), the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect [31, 43\u201345] and the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) and inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect [46, 47], respectively. However, in real systems, these processes can occur simultane- ously, along with spin-rectification effects (SREs) aris- ing from the interplay between time-varying magnetore- sistance and the applied oscillating field. This overlap makes it highly challenging to isolate the orbital pump- ing signal from the often dominant background contri- butions of spin pumping and SREs and so methods are needed to identify orbital pumping unambiguously. In this work, we demonstrate that we can obtain a clear distinction of orbital pumping by carefully select- ing materials with opposing signs of the OHE and SHE and by performing rigorous angular-dependent measure- ments of the pumped voltage signal. This is achieved using devices specifically designed to produce a more uniform radio frequency (RF) field while minimizing other parasitic effects as discussed in subsequent sec- arXiv:2502.08269v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 12 Feb 2025"
