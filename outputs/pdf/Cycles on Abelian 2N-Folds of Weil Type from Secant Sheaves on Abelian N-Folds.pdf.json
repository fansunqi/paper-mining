  "abstract": ". Let X be an abelian n-fold, n \u22652, and \u02c6X its dual abelian n-fold. Endow V =H1(X, Z)\u2295H1( \u02c6X, Z) with the natural symmetric bilinear pairing. The even coho- mology Hev(X, Z) is the half spin representation of Spin(V ). Fix an integer d > 0 and set K :=Q( \u221a \u2212d). A coherent sheaf F on X is a K-secant sheaf, if ch(F) belongs to a 2-dimensional non-isotropic subspace P of Hev(X, Q) spanned by Hodge classes, such that the line P(P) intersects the spinorial variety in P[Hev(X, K)] along two distinct complex conjugate points defined over K. The K-secant P determines an embedding \u03b7 : K \u2192EndQ(X\u00d7\u02c6X) and a rational (1, 1)-form h on X\u00d7\u02c6X. The triple (X\u00d7\u02c6X, \u03b7, h) is a polarized abelian variety of Weil type, for a non-empty open subset of such K-secants. Let F1, F2 be non-zero coherent sheaves on X with ch(Fi) in such a K-secant P. Orlov constructed a derived equivalence \u03a6 : Db(X\u00d7X) \u2192Db(X\u00d7 \u02c6X) categorifying the isomorphism of two Spin(V )-representations, the tensor square H\u2217(X\u00d7X, Z) of the spin representation, and \u2227\u2217V . Assume that the rank of E := \u03a6(F \u2228 1 \u22a0F2) is non-zero. We prove that the characteristic class exp \u0010 \u2212c1(E) rank(E) \u0011 ch(E) remains of Hodge type under every deformation of (X\u00d7 \u02c6X, \u03b7, h) as a polarized abelian variety of Weil type. The algebraicity of the Hodge-Weil classes of a deformation of the triple would follow, if E deforms as well as a possibly twisted object. When n = 3 we construct for every positive integer d an example, where K = Q( \u221a \u2212d) and the derived dual E of \u03a6(F \u2228 1 \u22a0F2)[1] is a simple reflexive sheaf over X\u00d7\u02c6X. We prove that E deforms with (X\u00d7 \u02c6X, \u03b7, h) locally in the 9-dimensional moduli space of polarized abelian 6-folds of Weil type of discriminant \u22121, using the Semiregularity theorem of Buchweitz-Flenner. The Hodge Conjecture for abelian fourfolds is known to follow from the above result. Contents 1. Introduction 3 1.1. Abelian varieties of Weil-type 3 1.2.
