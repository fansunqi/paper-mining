  "abstract": "Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the s-wave scattering length a and Fermi wavenumber kF, follow (1 + \u03b3kFa)/a2 up to corrections of order O(a0), with a positive coefficient \u03b3 for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in kFa greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group [1]. The dynamics of strongly interacting fermionic mat- ter is typically a strongly correlated phenomenon, chal- lenging controlled analytical approaches. The lack of a clear separation between few-body and many-body timescales invalidates the \u201cmolecular chaos\u201d hypothesis [2], and prevents describing few-body correlations as Markovian collisions. A more tractable scenario arises when the system obeys a kinetic equation [3] allowing its many-body dynamics to be captured by a one-body phase-space density governed by an instantaneous dif- ferential equation. In the hydrodynamic regime, the longest-wavelength perturbations evolve according to a reduced system of equations for the conserved quantities, analogous to the Navier-Stokes equations in classical flu- ids. Dissipative properties are then entirely determined by transport coefficients, which quantify the impact of collisions on these conserved quantities, and whose ab initio derivation from the microscopic characteristics of the fluid remains a highly challenging task. The kinetic description applies to Fermi systems only in specific limits: the weakly-interacting regime [4, 5], the high-temperature virial regime [6\u20138], and finally the low-temperature Fermi liquid regime. In the latter case, a low-energy effective description of the system as a di- lute gas of quasiparticles [9] is necessary to truncate the hierarchy of correlations. Even when quasiparticle in- teractions are large, the smallness of the temperature T ensures that the quasiparticle gas remains dilute with re- spect to the scattering crosssection, maintaining the sep- aration of timescales. The dynamics of a Fermi liquid is then fully determined by a set of functions describing the physics in the vicinity of the Fermi sphere: the quasipar- ticle interaction function f and the collision probability W. While Landau\u2019s Bethe-Salpeter equation [10] relates the forward-scattering probability to f, a full quantita- tive determination of transport properties requires the general expression of W for four non-collinear momenta near the Fermi surface [11]. Fermi liquids are found in a variety of contexts, from nuclear physics [12, 13] to condensed matter [14] or liquid Helium 3 [11, 15]. In most cases, theoretical predictions, restricted by the lack of knowledge on W, remain quali- tative. Ultracold fermionic gases are a remarkable excep- tion [16]. Atomic interactions are amenable to a unique parameter, the s-wave scattering length a, enabling mi- croscopic calculations of f [17] and W. Quantum gases offer very clean and controllable platforms, where one controls for instance the trapping geometry [18, 19] or the interaction strength [20]. Quantitative measurements of transport properties, in particular of transport coef- ficients, are already accessible both in harmonic traps [21\u201327], homogeneous systems [1, 28] and optical lattices [29], and provide deep insights into the many-body dy- namical properties. In the regime of negative scattering length, the smallness of the critical temperature Tc opens a regime where the gas is both normal and quantum de- generate, and should thus behave as an excellent Fermi liquid. Although this regime could provide a precious quanti- tative test of Fermi liquid theory, and appears as a pre- requisite to understand more difficult situations, such as the dynamics near the phase transition [26, 30\u201333] or at unitarity [6\u20138, 34, 35], existing theoretical predictions of its properties are still qualitative [5, 36\u201338], relying on uncontrolled approximations for either the collision probability, or the solution of the transport equation. A notable exception are the set of studies by Rainwater and M\u00f6hling [39, 40] which address the so-called \u201cdilute hard- sphere Fermi gas\u201d as an academic example in the context of nuclear physics [13, 41]. Here, we compute the three transport coefficients of the low-temperature unpolarized Fermi gas, the shear viscosity \u03b7, thermal conductivity \u03ba and spin diffusivity D, up to corrections linear in kFa.
