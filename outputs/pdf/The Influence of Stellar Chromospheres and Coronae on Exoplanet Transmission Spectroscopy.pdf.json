  "abstract": "A main source of bias in transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres is magnetic activity of the host star in the form of stellar spots, faculae or flares. However, the fact that main-sequence stars have a chromosphere and a corona, and that these optically thin layers are dominated by line emission may alter the global interpretation of the planetary spectrum, has largely been neglected. Using a JWST NIRISS/SOSS data set of hot Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we show that even at near-IR and IR wavelengths, the presence of these layers leads to significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere. Accounting for these stellar outer layers thus improves the atmospheric fit of HAT-P-18 b, and increases its best-fit atmospheric temperature from 536+189 \u2212101 K to 736+376 \u2212188 K, a value much closer to the predicted equilibrium temperature of \u223c852 K. Our analysis also decreases the best-fit abundance of CO2 by almost an order of magnitude. The approach provides a new window to the properties of chromospheres/corona in stars other than our Sun.

INTRODUCTION The exceptional capabilities of JWST, along with the de- velopment of sophisticated exoplanet atmosphere mod- els, has led to notable advances in the field of atmo- spheric studies via transmission spectroscopy (Ahrer et al. 2023; Alderson et al. 2023; Constantinou et al. 2023; Feinstein et al., 2023; Rustamkulov et al. 2023; Powell et al., 2024; Radica et al. 2024a; Xue et al., 2024). On the other hand, while JWST data acquired by its various instruments has enabled the discovery of pre- viously undetected molecular species and atmospheric properties, it also made common knowledge that the dominant limiting source of noise for many systems is magnetic activity of the stellar host in the form of pho- tospheric heterogeneities via the transit light source ef- fect (Howard et al., 2023; Lim et al., 2023; May et al. 2023; Moran et al. 2023; Cadieux et al. 2024; Fournier- Corresponding author: Volker Perdelwitz volker.perdelwitz@weizmann.ac.il Tondreau et al., 2024; Radica et al. 2024b; Saba et al., 2024). The outer layers of the stellar atmosphere, the chromosphere and corona, are usually associated with UV and X-ray emission, despite the fact that both have originally been discovered in visible light (de Ferrer 1809; Lockyer 1868). Including optically thin extended layers like these in the transit model will result in a shallower but wider transit, which cannot be accounted for by standard photospheric transit models without in- troducing wavelength-dependent changes to the orbital parameters. Fig.1 shows a phenomenological overview of the effect of such an optically thin outer layer on transit shape, with three numerically simulated bright- ness profiles and their resulting transits, assuming or- bital parameters of HAT-P-18 b. In order to model the occultation of light from all layers of the stellar atmo- sphere, we developed Transits Across CHromosphEri- caeLy activE Stars (TACHELES) , which combines a photospheric (i.e., Mandel & Agol 2002) component with one that describes the extended, optically thin na- ture of the chromosphere and corona.
