  "abstract": "\u2014We consider a status update system consisting of one source, one server, and one sink. The source generates packets according to a Poisson process and the packets are served according to a generally distributed service time. We consider a system with a capacity of one packet, i.e., there is no waiting buffer in the system, and model it as an M/G/1/1 queueing system. We introduce a probabilistically preemptive packet management policy and calculate the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the age of information (AoI) and peak AoI (PAoI) under the policy. According to the probabilistically preemptive policy, when a packet arrives, the possible packet in the system is replaced by the arriving packet with a fixed probability. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the packet management policy. I. INTRODUCTION Ensuring the freshness of status updates for various real- world physical processes is a crucial component of many cyber-physical system applications, such as smart factories and autonomous vehicles. In these applications, stale status updates hold no value, even if they are successfully delivered to the destination or decision maker. In [1], the age of information (AoI) was introduced to measure the information freshness at the destination in status update systems. The peak AoI (PAoI) was later introduced in [2] as an alternative metric for evaluating information freshness. The AoI measures the difference between the current time and the time stamp of the last received sample from the monitored process. A. Contributions We consider a single-source status update system with one server and no waiting buffer. Packets are generated according to a Poisson process and have with iid general service time distribution. We derive the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the AoI and PAoI under a probabilis- tically preemptive policy. According to the policy, when a packet arrives, the possible packet in the system is preempted by the arriving packet with a fixed probability. From the MGFs, we derive the average AoI and PAoI expressions. Our results show that using either a preemptive policy (an arriving packet always preempts a packet in service) or a non-preemptive policy (an arriving packet is blocked and cleared when the server is busy) can be quite inefficient in terms of AoI performance. When a preemption mechanism is available, the system must learn when to apply it. Moreover, finding the optimal value for the probability of preemption can significantly enhance timeliness. B. Related work The first queueing-theoretic study on AoI was presented in [1], where the average AoI for M/M/1, D/M/1, and M/D/1 first-come first-served (FCFS) queueing models was derived. As demonstrated in [3], [4], implementing appropriate packet management policies in status update systems\u2014either in the waiting queue, the server, or both\u2014can significantly enhance information freshness. The performance of various packet management policies in queueing systems with exponentially distributed service times and Poisson arrivals has been exten- sively analyzed in the literature [5]\u2013[15]. Besides exponentially distributed service time and Poisson arrivals, AoI has been studied under various arrival processes and service time distributions. The distribution of the AoI and PAoI for the single-source PH/PH/1/1 and M/PH/1/2 queueing models were derived in [16]. The average AoI of a single- source D/G/1 FCFS queueing model was derived in [17]. A closed-form expression of the average AoI for a single-source M/G/1/1 preemptive queueing model with hybrid automatic repeat request was derived in [18]. The distributions of the AoI and PAoI of single-source M/G/1/1 FCFS and G/M/1/1 FCFS queueing models were derived in [19]. A general formula for the distribution of the AoI in single-source single- server queueing systems was derived in [20]. The average AoI and PAoI of a single-source status update system with Poisson arrivals and a service time with gamma distribution under the last-come first-served (LCFS) policy were analyzed in [21]. The average AoI of a single-source G/G/1/1 queueing model was studied in [22]. The distribution of the AoI in a generate-at-will single-source dual-server system was derived in [23]. The authors considered that the servers serve packets according to exponentially distributed service times where the sampling and transmission process is frozen for a period of time with Erlang distribution upon each transmission. The average AoI and PAoI in a multi-source M/G/1 FCFS queueing model were studied in [24], [25]. The average AoI of a queueing system with two classes of Poisson arrivals with different priorities under a general service time distri- bution was studied in [26]. The average AoI and PAoI of a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing model under the globally preemptive packet management policy were derived in [27]. According to the globally preemptive packet management pol- icy, a new arriving packet preempts the possible under-service packet independent of the source index of the packets.
