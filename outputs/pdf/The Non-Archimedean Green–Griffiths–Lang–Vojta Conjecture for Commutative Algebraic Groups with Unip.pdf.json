  "abstract": ". Let k be algebraically closed \ufb01eld of characteristic zero, let G be a commutative al- gebraic group over k such that the linear part of G is isomorphic to Ga, and let X be a closed subvariety of G. We show that the Kawamata locus of X is equal to a Lang-like exceptional lo- cus of X, and furthermore, we identify a condition on X that implies that these loci are proper subschemes of X. We also prove the strong form of the non-Archimedean Green\u2013Gri\ufb03ths\u2013Lang\u2013 Vojta conjecture for closed subvarieties of commutative algebraic groups where the linear part is isomorphic to Ga \u00d7 Gt m. 1. Introduction In this work, we prove algebraic and non-Archimedean analytic results concerning the structure of certain exceptional loci of closed subvarieties of commutative algebraic groups with unipotent rank one. Let k be an algebraically closed \ufb01eld of characteristic zero and let X be a smooth projective k-variety. A conjecture of Bombieri\u2013Lang1 [Lan62] predicts that when X is of general type, X is arithmetically hyperbolic, which means that there exists a Zariski closed proper subscheme Z of X, called the exceptional locus of X, such that for any \ufb01nitely generated sub\ufb01eld k\u2032 of k, X has only \ufb01nitely many k\u2032-rational points outside of Z(k\u2032). There are several conjectural descriptions of this subscheme that are related to algebraic, complex analytic, and non-Archimedean analytic characterizations of being of general type, and the conjectures of Green, Gri\ufb03ths, and Lang describe the precise relationship between these characterizations There is also a variant of this conjecture due to the second author concerning integral points on non-projective k-varieties which are of logarithmic general type. We refer the reader to [Jav20] for further discussion on these notions and the precise conjectures. Most of the progress on the Lang\u2013Vojta conjecture has focused on the setting where X is a closed subvariety of a commutative algebraic k-group G. When G is complete (i.e., G is an abelian k- variety), Faltings [Fal91, Fal94] proved that the intersection of X with a \ufb01nitely generated subgroup \u0393 \u2282A(k) is a \ufb01nite union of cosets of subgroups of \u0393. The second author [Voj96, Voj99] proved this result holds in the more general setting where G is a semi-abelian k-variety (i.e., an extension of an abelian k-variety by a torus). Additionally, McQuillan [McQ95] showed that the second author\u2019s results can be extended where \u0393 is replaced by any \ufb01nite rank subgroup of a semi-abelian k-variety. In each of these settings, one can use a property of morphisms between semi-abelian Date: February 17, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 14G05 (32Q45, 14L10, 14G22).
