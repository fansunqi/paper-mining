  "abstract": ". Although the methodology of Design Science Research (DSR) is playing an increasingly important role with the emergence of the \u2018sci- ences of the artificial\u2019, the validity of the resulting artifacts is occasionally questioned. This paper compares three influential DSR frameworks to as- sess their support for artifact validity. Using five essential validity types (instrument validity, technical validity, design validity, purpose validity and generalization), the qualitative analysis reveals that while purpose validity is explicitly emphasized, instrument and design validity remain the least developed. Their implicit treatment in all frameworks poses a risk of overlooked validation, and the absence of mandatory instrument validity can lead to invalid artifacts, threatening research credibility. Be- yond these findings, the paper contributes (a) a comparative overview of each framework\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and (b) a revised DSR framework incorporating all five validity types with definitions and ex- amples. This ensures systematic artifact evaluation and improvement, reinforcing the rigor of DSR. Keywords: design science research, artifact validity, validity types 1 Introduction With the rise of the \u2018sciences of the artificial\u2019 [27], Design Science Research (DSR) methodology plays an increasingly important role and is gaining ground in higher education institutions much faster than in previous years and decades. With Hevner [9,8], DSR has become widespread and popular in the field of information technology, but also through intensive efforts in German-speaking countries, especially in business informatics [34], as it focuses on the creation of novel artifacts. As technically oriented disciplines often permeate all areas of life and play an important supporting role in all subject disciplines, the DSR methodology can be applied to the development of new artifacts of all kinds, from software to physical tools such as printed teaching materials or human body prostheses. Although it seems to have been clear among DSR experts for decades what DSR can and cannot achieve, e.g. [20,17,27,7], this discussion has only just begun arXiv:2502.11199v1 [cs.OH] 16 Feb 2025"
