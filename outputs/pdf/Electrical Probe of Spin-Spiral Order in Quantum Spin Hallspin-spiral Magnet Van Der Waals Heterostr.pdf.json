However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challeng- ing to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining sig- natures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement provides a method to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures. Introduction.\u2014Frustrated and noncollinear magnetic systems provide an exciting platform for exploring fun- damental phenomena and the great potential for stray- field-free spintronics [1\u20136]. Spin-spiral magnets (SSMs) feature a variety of exotic phenomena, including multifer- roicity [1, 7, 8], unconventional spin excitations [9, 10], and topological magnetism [11]. The detection of non- collinear magnetic states in three-dimensional bulk sys- tems can be achieved with neutron scattering [12, 13]. However, probing spin spirals in two-dimensional (2D) materials represents a bigger challenge due to their re- duced cross-section. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy [3, 14] requires that the magnet is the top- most layer, and thus becomes challenging in encapsu- lated samples. Detecting symmetry-breaking with van- ishing magnetization can enable characterizing magnetic 2D materials, including monolayer spin-spiral multifer- roic NiI2 [8, 15\u201318], van der Waals heavy-fermion Kondo lattices [19\u201323], and frustrated spin liquid candidates like 1T-TaS2 [24\u201328]. The conductance of the topological he- lical edge states coupled with a 2D magnetic material may offer an appealing strategy to tackle this problem. Topological insulators (TIs) [29\u201332] are promising con- stituents of future technologies such as topological quan- tum computing [33] and spintronics [34]. The potential of TIs stems from the existence of gapless edge states protected as long as a specific symmetry is not broken. Among topological states, quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) such as 1T\u2019-WTe2 [35, 36] provide a poten- tial platform for dissipationless spin-transport and fun- damental building blocks to engineer other exotic states by creating artificial interfaces [37\u201339], including Chern insulators and topological superconductors [33, 40, 41]. In the case of quantum spin Hall insulators, the topo- logical edge modes feature spin-momentum locking and robustness to nonmagnetic external perturbations that FIG. 1.

Here, we show that the electronic transport of helical QSHI states can be employed as a probe of noncollinear magnetism in QSHI/SSM van der Waals heterostruc- tures. We demonstrate that the simultaneous presence of spin magnetization and nonmagnetic disorder quenches the conductance of topological edge states.
