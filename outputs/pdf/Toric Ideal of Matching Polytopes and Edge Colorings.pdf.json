  "abstract": ". In the present paper, we investigate the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal of the matching polytope of a graph. It is known that the toric ideal associated to a bipartite graph is generated by binomials of degree at most 3. We show that this fact is equivalent to a result in the theory of edge colorings of bipartite multigraphs. Moreover, a characterization of bipartite graphs whose toric ideals are generated by quadratic binomials is given. Finally, we discuss the maximal degree of minimal generators of the toric ideal associated to a general graph and give a conjecture. 1. INTRODUCTION In the present paper, we discuss a relationship between an algebraic property of toric ideals arising from graphs and a combinatorial property of edge colorings of multigraphs. Throughout this paper, we assume that a graph is simple, namely, it has no loops and no multiple edges and, a multigraph has no loops. Let G be a graph with the vertex set V(G) = [d] := {1,2,...,d} and the edge set E(G) = {e1,...,en}. A matching of G is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges of G, and a perfect matching of G is a matching that covers every vertex of G. Let M(G) (resp. PM(G)) denote the set of all matchings (resp. perfect matchings) of G. Given a subset M \u2282E(G), we associate the (0,1)-vector \u03c1(M) = \u2211e j\u2208M ej \u2208Rn. Here ej is the jth unit coordinate vector in Rn. For example, \u03c1(/0) = (0,...,0) \u2208Rn. Then the (full) matching polytope MG of G is de\ufb01ned as the convex hull MG = conv{\u03c1(M) : M \u2208M(G)} and the perfect matching polytope PG of G is de\ufb01ned as PG = conv{\u03c1(M) : M \u2208PM(G)}. Note that PG is a face of MG. Moreover, the perfect matching polytope of a complete bipartite graph Kd,d is called the Birkhoff polytope, denoted by Bd. In [8], it was conjectured that the toric ideal IBn of the Birkhoff polytope Bn is generated by binomials of degree at most 3, and this conjecture was shown in [22]. Moreover, in [9], by using this result, the toric ideal of a \ufb02ow polytope is generated by binomials of degree at most 3. For a homogeneous ideal I, let \u03c9(I) denote the maximal degree of minimal generators of I. Since the matching polytope of a bipartite graph is unimodularly equivalent to a \ufb02ow polytope (see Appendix A), the following result holds: Theorem 1.1 ([9]). For a bipartite graph G, one has \u03c9(IMG) \u22643. Next, we recall a result of edge-colorings of multigraphs. Let G be a multigraph. For a k-edge- coloring f of G and a color 1 \u2264j \u2264k, let M(e)( f, j) denote the set of all edges of color j. We say 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 05C15, 13P10, 13F65.
