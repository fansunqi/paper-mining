  "abstract": "Metacognitive education plays a crucial role in cultivating students\u2019 self-regulation and re- flective thinking, providing essential support for those with learning difficulties through aca- demic advising. Simulating students with in- sufficient learning capabilities using large lan- guage models offers a promising approach to refining pedagogical methods without ethical concerns. However, existing simulations often fail to authentically represent students\u2019 learn- ing struggles and face challenges in evaluation due to the lack of reliable metrics and ethical constraints in data collection. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline for automatically generating and filtering high-quality simulated student agents. Our approach leverages a two- round automated scoring system validated by human experts and employs a score propaga- tion module to obtain more consistent scores across the student graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline efficiently identi- fies high-quality student agents, and we discuss the traits that influence the simulation\u2019s effec- tiveness. By simulating students with varying degrees of learning difficulties, our work paves the way for broader applications in personal- ized learning and educational assessment. 1 Introduction As is famously quoted by Joseph Addison \"What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to the human soul,\", it emphasizes the transformative power of education in shaping individuals. Genera- tions of educators have contributed to cultivating and \"polishing\" students\u2019 abilities to enhance their metacognitive skills, i.e., the skills about learning how to learn, rather than just transmitting specific knowledge (Tanner, 2012). Research indicates that well-developed metacognitive abilities are linked to improved learning outcomes (Schraw and Mosh- man, 1995; Silver et al., 2023). To date, increasing attention has been devoted to their development beyond the implicit cultivation of these metacog- nitive skills in daily instructional activities. This has even led to the establishment of specialized Academic Advising discipline, aiming at support- ing students who encounter learning difficulties. However, this crucial domain continues to face an inherent challenge: while such interventions are beneficial, relying on real-world student par- ticipants to experiment with instructional methods risks unintended consequences. Such studies may inadvertently expose participants to psychological distress, privacy breaches, or academic disadvan- tages (Burns et al., 2008; Doody, 2018). Instead, simulating such \"raw\" students\u2014who still require targeted support\u2014can offer educators valuable in- sights into refining their pedagogical approaches without ethical concerns. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been increasingly employed as human simulators in the social sciences (Gao et al., 2024). By repli- cating human behaviors (Qian et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), decision-making processes (Park et al., 2023), and social interac- tions (Qian et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023), LLM-based simulations enable re- searchers to conduct studies that would otherwise require extensive data collection or large-scale ex- periments (Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a). The success encourages a promising approach for studying academic advising by simulating stu- dent with LLM-based agents. Although some re- searchers have attempted to simulate students based on problem-solving behaviors (Ma et al., 2024; Lu and Wang, 2024) or dialogue interactions (Markel et al., 2023), incorporating meta-cognitive abilities remains a challenge. Numerous technical obstacles need to be ex- plored to effectively simulate \"raw\" students with insufficient learning capabilities. First, large lan- guage models (LLMs) are inherently optimized for generating correct answers and factual responses, 1 arXiv:2502.11678v1 [cs.CY] 17 Feb 2025"
