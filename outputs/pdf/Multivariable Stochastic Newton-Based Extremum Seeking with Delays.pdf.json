  "abstract": "This paper presents a Newton-based stochastic extremum-seeking control method for real-time optimization in multi-input systems with distinct input delays. It combines predictor-based feedback and Hessian inverse estimation via stochastic perturbations to enable delay compensation with user-defined convergence rates. The method ensures exponential stability and convergence near the unknown extremum, even under long delays. It extends to multi-input, single-output sys- tems with cross-coupled channels. Stability is analyzed using backstepping and infinite-dimensional averaging. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effective- ness in handling time-delayed channels, showcasing both the challenges and benefits of real-time optimization in distributed parameter settings.
