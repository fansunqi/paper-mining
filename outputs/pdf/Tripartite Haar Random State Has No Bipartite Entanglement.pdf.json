  "abstract": "We show that no EPR-like bipartite entanglement can be distilled from a tripartite Haar ran- dom state |\u03a8\u27e9ABC by local unitary rotations when each subsystem has fewer than half of the total qubits. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the probability of sampling a state with EPR-like entanglement for a given EPR fidelity tolerance, showing a doubly-exponential suppression in the number of qubits. Our proof relies on a simple volume argument supplemented by an \u03f5-net construc- tion. We also discuss a physical interpretation in the AdS/CFT correspondence, indicating that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply bipartite entanglement as opposed to a previous belief. 1 Introduction Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of many fundamental questions in quantum physics. How- ever, the study of strongly entangled quantum systems poses significant challenges, as analytical and numerical approaches are often limited. Haar random states provide useful insights into the physical properties of certain many-body quantum systems. These states, characterized by their entanglement properties averaged over random ensembles, provide a powerful tool for understanding complex quan- tum systems with some degree of analytical tractability. In condensed matter physics, Haar random states (and unitaries) have proven instrumental in understanding dynamical properties, as in eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [1], scrambling dynamics [2], and random matrix theory [3]. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, Haar random state and unitary serve as minimal toy models of a quantum black hole [4\u20136] and Haar random tensor networks serve as toy models obeying the Ryu-Takayanagi formula at the AdS scale at the leading order [7, 8]. Also, the properties of Haar random states have played a central role in quantum information theory, as many protocols and fundamental questions rely on these states or on approximations that mimic their behavior [9]. Bipartite entanglement of a Haar random state |\u03a8\u27e9AB, when the total system is bi-partitioned into two complementary subsystems A, B, are well understood [4, 10, 11]. In particular, |\u03a8\u27e9AB contains \u2248min(nA, nB) copies of approximate EPR pairs shared between A and B up to some local unitary \u2217takato.mori@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp \u2020byoshida@perimeterinstitute.ca 1 arXiv:2502.04437v1 [quant-ph] 6 Feb 2025"
