  "abstract": "In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive study of gravitational lensing by dark com- pact objects predicted by a Modified Gravity (MOG) based on the Scalar-Vector-Tensor action, and the aim is to analyze new insights into the nature of gravitational interactions. We compute weak and strong deflection angles for the specified static, spherically symmetric MOG spacetime. Additionally, we dedicate a section to explore observational implications in the weak field limit. By employing a supermassive galactic black hole as a gravitational lens, we compare various parameters in MOG with those of the Schwarzschild black hole as lens in strong-field scenarios. Specifically, we model the black holes M87\u2217and Sgr A\u2217as lenses within the MOG framework, calculating the corresponding lensing coefficients and distortion parameters in the weak field regime. \u2217naginarehman.0123@gmail.com \u2020bravychancs@gmail.com \u2021mjamil@sns.nust.edu.pk (corresponding author) \u00a7azreg@baskent.edu.tr 1 arXiv:2502.06313v1 [gr-qc] 10 Feb 2025"
