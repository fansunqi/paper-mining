  "title": "Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity Baryogenesis and Dark Matter.pdf",
  "abstract": "Pasteura 5, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold\u2019s direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with w = 1). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduc- tion, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above O(108) GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling \u03be \u223c(f/mP )2 or somewhat larger, where f is the axion decay constant. I. INTRODUCTION Cosmic inflation is a period of exponential increase in the size of the Universe which ac- counts for the otherwise fine-tuned initial con- ditions of the hot Big Bang history, and is re- sponsible for generating the primordial density perturbations seeding structure formation [1\u20134]. The measurements of the cosmic microwave back- ground (CMB) radiation, help us unravel the mi- croscopic model of inflation which come in many avatars. The recent CMB observations from the Planck satellite mission [5] have led to severe con- straints on several inflationary models but nei- ther it has been able to yet pin down upon a spe- cific scenario nor it has gives us definitive insights into embedding of the inflationary paradigm into fundamental particle physics theory like that of Grand Unification (GUT). Upcoming CMB mis- sions like the Simons Observatory [6], the Lite- BIRD satellite [7, 8] or the ground-based CMB Stage 4 program [9], Ali CMB Polarization Tele- scope [10] and CMB-Bharat [11] will be able to further investigate on this direction, partic- ularly so concerning the measurement of the \u2217cchao012@just.edu.cn \u2020 surujjd@gmail.com \u2021 konst.dimopoulos@lancaster.ac.uk \u00a7 anish.ghoshal@fuw.edu.pl tensor-to-scalar ratio r [12], which basically de- picts the energy scale of inflation which is deter- mined once the BB-mode correlations are mea- sured and dark radiation measurements \u2206Neff. This leads to important science targets to go be- yond this paradigm and also test the indirect ev- idence of such inflationary characteristics like for instance, observables signatures like primordial non-gaussianity which may point towards inflaton interactions or the microscopic details of the re- heating epoch in the post-inflationary epoch [13\u2013 18]. Of particular interest are non-oscillatory mod- els of inflation, which are driven by a runaway flat direction in field space [19]. These have been fre- quently envisaged when modeling quintessential inflation [20] (for recent reviews see Refs. [21\u2013 24]), where the inflaton and the quintessence [25] fields are unified and cosmic inflation is treated in the same theoretical framework as dark energy. In quintessential inflation, because the inflaton has to survive until the present and explain dark energy, the Universe after inflation has to be re- heated by means other than the decay of the in- flaton field. A prominent mechanism for this is Ricci reheating [26\u201328]. This amounts to a mini- mal Hubble-induced reheating mechanism which is based on the time-dependence and change of sign of the Ricci scalar.
