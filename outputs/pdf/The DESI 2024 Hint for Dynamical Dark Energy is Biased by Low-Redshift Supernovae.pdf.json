  "abstract": "In this letter, we reveal this significant preference is dominated by an external low-redshift supernova (low-z SN) sample that combines with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year 5 data release (DESY5). Further implementing the aB (the intercept of the SN magnitude-redshift relation) diagnosis between low-z and DES-SN samples, we find large dispersions in the low-z SN sample with a \u223c0.043 magnitude discrepancy in \u22125aB from the high-z DES-SN sample, suggesting potential systematics in DESY5. Correcting for this low-z systematics or directly ignoring the low-z sample can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be < 2\u03c3. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE might be a mirage of low-z SN systematics with a mismatch intercept. Our additional test demonstrates the currently available data cannot provide decisive evidence for dynamical DE. Introduction.\u2014 The standard Lambda-cold-dark- matter (\u039bCDM) model, consisting of radiation, baryonic matter, cold dark matter, and a cosmological constant \u039b in a spatially flat, isotropic and homogeneous Uni- verse with primordial perturbations provided by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian random scalar field, has passed a wide variety of cosmological tests [1\u20139]. De- spite its great success over the past quarter century, a few tensions [10] including the \u223c5\u03c3 Hubble tension [11\u201315], \u223c3\u03c3 S8 tension [16, 17] as well as \u223c4\u03c3 \u03b3 tension [18] have hinted for cracking this concordant model. Since the \u039b component that might as well be dynamical dark energy (DE) driving the late-time acceleration still re- mains an enigma, whether the \u039bCDM model should be replaced by new physics would call for special cautions. As the most updated Stage IV survey, the Dark En- ergy Survey (DES) characterizes the properties of dark matter and DE with unprecedented precision and accu- racy through multiple probes like Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), weak lensings, large-scale structures, galaxy clusters [19\u201321]. The recent release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for baryon acoustic os- cillations (BAO) [22] together with full 5-year photomet- rically classified SNe Ia (DES-SN), when combined with additional external low-z SNe (namely DESY5) [23, 24], have triggered heated debates on the dynamical DE. The cosmological constraints inferred from DESI BAO or DESY5 alone are consistent with the standard flat \u039bCDM model, while the joint constraint of DESI BAO, DESY5, and Planck CMB surprisingly favors a quintom- like dynamic DE behavior, showing a 3.9\u03c3 tension to the \u2217huanglu@itp.ac.cn \u2020 cairg@itp.ac.cn \u2021 schwang@itp.ac.cn (corresponding author) \u039bCDM model [22, 25]. A similar but weaker preference (\u223c2\u03c3) of dynamic DE is also achieved without the par- ticipations of DESI BAO and DESY5 [26]. These hints for new physics have attracted significant interests in the community with subsequent numerous theoretical studies on different kinds of dynamical DE, e.g. Refs. [27\u201352]. In parallel with searches for theoretical explanations, inconsistencies between DES measurements (DESI BAO, DESY5) and previous high-quality measurements (SDSS BAO [5], PantheonPlus SNe [53\u201359]) have also been widely debated [60\u201366]. For example, the combination of DESI LRG1 and LRG2 data is found to be the key driver for the preference of dynamical DE [22, 41, 60\u201362]. Nev- ertheless, these two data exhibit mild tension with SDSS BAO [5] for unknown reasons. By comparing the mean magnitude-redshift residuals between PantheonPlus and DESY5, Ref. [65] found a \u223c0.04 \u22120.05 mag difference in the overlapping regime, indicating unidentified SNe systematics in DESY5 (see, however, Ref. [67]). Correct- ing this offset would cancel the preference for dynamical DE, bringing cosmological constraints of the corrected DESY5 back to \u039bCDM. Therefore, it cannot simply rule out the possibility of potential systematics in DESY5. Including the low-z SNe sample (consists of CSP [68], CfA [69, 70], and Foundation [71] samples) with the least systematic control in cosmological analyses is controver- sial in practice. As highlighted in Refs. [23, 24], the spec- troscopically confirmed low-z sample (different from the photometrically classified DES SNe in the observational method) is the most critical source of systematics due to the lack of homogeneity and complete calibrations. Specifically, the nuisance parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 used to correct for SNe color and stretch dependencies show significant discrepancies between low-z and DES-SN samples. Given that the properties and selection effects of the low-z sam- ple still lack sufficient understanding, additional system- arXiv:2502.04212v1 [astro-ph.CO] 6 Feb 2025"
