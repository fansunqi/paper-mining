While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. However, there are several sets of assumptions capturing the notions of prior ig- norance and uninformed estimation, leading to two main approaches: invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, and adherence to the geometry of a state space. While the first approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive settings, the second can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. We examine the practical con- sequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. More importantly, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed\u2014a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors. I. INTRODUCTION Precise knowledge of a system\u2019s parameters is crucial for the control of quantum devices [1, 2] and their application to the study of nature [3\u20139]. Strategies to estimate such para- meters are typically designed to optimise sensing performance over many measurements, both in conventional phase estim- ation [10\u201313] and in emerging applications of open-system metrology [14\u201317]. These strategies generally rely on local estimation, which assumes that the true value of the parameter is approximately known within a small window [13, 18]. However, in many practical applications, the available data for estimating these parameters is inherently limited [19\u201324]. For instance, quantum optical and optomechanical platforms are increasingly put forward as sensors to probe fundamental physics and, possibly, discover or rule out yet unobserved phenomena, such as quantum signatures of gravity, dark mat- ter particles, and spontaneous collapse [7, 25\u201328]. Signals of such types are expected to be weak and poorly character- ised, while the corresponding experiments would be difficult to realise and data sparse. This not only calls for suitable quantum-enhanced sensing schemes, but also for a prescrip- tion of optimal estimation strategies from finite statistics. The Bayesian paradigm is well suited for this task, as no- ticed, e.g, in the context of quantum-classical model selec- tion [29] and tests of collapse models [30\u201334]. Within this paradigm, any information available prior to performing a measurement is quantified through a prior distribution, which is subsequently updated as new data are acquired [35, 36]. This procedure is general and can be applied to any sample size. Consequently, Bayesian techniques naturally enable \u2217julia.boeyens@uni-siegen.de \u2020 j.rubiojimenez@surrey.ac.uk global estimation and sensing, allowing the unknown para- meter to initially lie within a window of arbitrary size. Thanks to the explicit incorporation of prior information, Bayesian techniques readily provide the optimisation equa- tions required to devise optimal estimation strategies [35, 37]. Solving these equations may be unfeasible in complex scen- arios, for which lower error bounds, whether Bayesian [38\u2013 40] or even frequentist [41, 42], can offer a useful comprom- ise. However, the strategies thus identified often lack general- ity, proving optimal only under certain circumstances [13, 43\u2013 45]. This motivates a redirection of efforts towards the search for new methods to optimise Bayesian quantum estimation strategies exactly [46, 47]. One such method uses the notion of location-isomorphic parameter [48, 49], i.e., a parameter that does not represent a location\u2014such as temperature, decay rate, or probability of success\u2014but can be mapped to a location parameter through an appropriate transformation. For instance, scale parameters are trivially mapped to locations via a logarithmic transform- ation. Since, for location parameters, the optimal estimation strategy can be written in closed form in both classical [35, 50] and quantum settings [37, 51], such a mapping extends these optimal strategies to any location-isomorphic parameter. Global quantum thermometry [40, 52\u201355], based on either quantum scale estimation [56] or geometric considerations via the notion of thermodynamic length [57], was an early realisation of location-isomorphic estimation. Furthermore, scale-invariant errors have been applied to length scale estim- ation for massive oscillators [58]. More importantly, location- isomorphic strategies have been experimentally validated for the estimation of temperature [59, 60] and atom number [49] in cold-atom platforms. To fully realise the potential of location-isomorphic estimation, however, a clear and practical methodology is needed to determine how a given parameter can be transformed into a location parameter. The present work provides such a methodology. We de- arXiv:2502.14817v1 [quant-ph] 20 Feb 2025"
