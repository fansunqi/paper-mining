ARABNYA1,2 1University of Denver 2Quanta Technology SUMMARY In recent years, the frequency and intensity of grid-ignited wildfires have increased significantly, leading to an elevated level of risk exposure to public safety and financial repercussions for electric utilities threatening their solvency. It is, therefore, imperative for electric utilities to accurately assess the financial impact of potential wildfires ignited by their power infrastructure. This is a critical step toward developing risk-informed strategies to mitigate grid-ignited wildfires from both operational and financial perspectives. This paper proposes and develops an integrated model to evaluate the damage costs associated with potential grid-ignited wildfires to allow assessing financial risk with greater precision than existing literature. The proposed model is tailored to assess the financial risk associated with grid-ignited wildfires, including environmental damages, destroyed structures, and damage to the power grid assets. We quantify the risk associated with each power line, thereby identifying areas that require immediate preemptive actions. To visually represent the risk levels associated with the transmission grid topology, we implement a color-coded risk heatmap. The heatmap categorizes risk levels as follows: low-risk areas are denoted in white, moderate- low risk regions in green, medium-risk areas in yellow, and high-risk zones in red. A reliable risk assessment provides several benefits for electric utilities. First, it enables them to identify High- Fire Risk Areas (HFRAs) that require immediate vegetation management and prioritize sections for undergrounding and conductor upgrades. By incorporating real-time weather data, electric utilities can make data-driven, risk-informed decisions to enhance their preemptive de-energization. Second, it can enhance situational awareness and early warning systems by identifying high-risk areas suitable for fire detectors and optimize the placement of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) near these zones. Third, precise wildfire risk assessment enhances financial protection by promoting information exchange between electric utilities and insurance companies. This collaboration helps distribute the financial risk more effectively. By adopting the proposed approach, electric utilities can enhance operational efficiency, improve safety measures, and develop robust financial strategies to mitigate the impact of wildfires triggered by their power lines.
