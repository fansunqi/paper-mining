  "abstract": "The spatial scan statistic is widely used to detect disease clus- ters in epidemiological surveillance. Since the seminal work by Kull- dorff (1997), numerous extensions have emerged, including methods for defining scan regions, detecting multiple clusters, and expand- ing statistical models. Notably, Jung (2009) and Zhang and Lin (2009a) introduced a regression-based approach accounting for covari- ates, encompassing classical methods such as those of Kulldorff (1997). Another key extension is the expectation-based approach (Neill and Moore 2005, Neill 2006), which differs from the population-based ap- proach represented by Kulldorff (1997) in terms of hypothesis test- ing. In this paper, we bridge the regression-based approach with both expectation-based and population-based approaches. We reveal that 1 arXiv:2502.06347v1 [stat.ME] 10 Feb 2025"
