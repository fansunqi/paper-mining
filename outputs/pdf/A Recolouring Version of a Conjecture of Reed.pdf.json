  "title": "A Recolouring Version of a Conjecture of Reed.pdf",
  "abstract": "Reed conjectured that the chromatic number of any graph is closer to its clique number than to its maximum degree plus one. We consider a recolouring version of this conjecture, with respect to Kempe changes. Namely, we investigate the largest \u03b5 such that all graphs G are k-recolourable for all k \u2a7e\u2308\u03b5\u03c9(G) + (1 \u2212\u03b5)(\u2206(G) + 1)\u2309. For general graphs, an existing construction of a frozen colouring shows that \u03b5 \u2a7d1/3. We show that this construction is optimal in the sense that there are no frozen colourings below that threshold. For this reason, we conjecture that \u03b5 = 1/3. For triangle-free graphs, we give a construction of frozen colourings that shows that \u03b5 \u2a7d4/9, and prove that it is also optimal. In the special case of odd-hole-free graphs, we show that \u03b5 = 1/2, and that this is tight up to one colour. 1 Introduction The chromatic number \u03c7(G) of any graph G lies between its clique number \u03c9(G) and the max- imum degree \u2206(G) plus one. A natural question is which of these two bounds is closer to the chromatic number. Reed [13] conjectured that the chromatic number of any graph G is at most \u2308(\u03c9(G) + \u2206(G) + 1) /2\u2309. In the same article, Reed proved using the probabilistic method that this bound is tight if true (see Theorem 2 in [13]). He also proved that there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that for all G, \u03c7(G) \u2a7d \u2308\u03b5\u03c9(G) + (1 \u2212\u03b5)(\u2206(G) + 1)\u2309. More recently, King and Reed [8] gave a significantly shorter proof of this result and proved that for large enough \u2206, Reed\u2019s conjecture holds for \u03b5 \u2a7d 1 320e6 . This conjecture generated a lot of interest over the past years and similar statements were proved in [13, 4] for increasing values of \u03b5.
