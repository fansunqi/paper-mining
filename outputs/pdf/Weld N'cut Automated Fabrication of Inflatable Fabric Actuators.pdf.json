  "abstract": "\u2014Lightweight, durable textile-based inflatable soft ac- tuators are widely used in soft robotics, particularly for wearable robots in rehabilitation and in enhancing human performance in demanding jobs. Fabricating these actuators typically involves multiple steps: heat-sealable fabrics are fused with a heat press, and non-stick masking layers define internal chambers. These layers must be carefully removed post-fabrication, often making the process labor-intensive and prone to errors. To address these challenges and improve the accuracy and performance of inflatable actuators, we introduce the Weld n\u2019Cut platform\u2014an open-source, automated manufacturing process that combines ultrasonic welding for fusing textile layers with an oscillating knife for precise cuts, enabling the creation of complex inflatable structures. We demonstrate the machine\u2019s performance across various materials and designs with arbitrarily complex geome- tries.

INTRODUCTION Soft inflatable actuators have transformed the field of robotics by offering flexibility and adaptability, enabling smooth and natural movements through inflation and defla- tion [1], [2]. These characteristics make the soft inflatable robots well-suited for applications where safety is critical, such as medical devices [3], [4], wearable technology [5], [6], and delicate object manipulation [7]. The ability of soft inflatables to exhibit diverse deformation patterns enhances their versatility, allowing them to perform complex tasks across diverse environments [8], [1], [9]. Textiles are one of the most widely used materials in fabricating soft inflatable actuators [10]. Due to their flexibility, strength, and lightweight properties, textiles allow for precise control over how the actu- ators move when inflated [11], [12]. By carefully manipulating textile properties such as its weave [13], stretchability [5], and pattern [14], [15], designers can control the direction and degree of deformation, dictating how the actuator bends, twists, or contracts [13], [5], [14]. Among these properties, the pattern and stretchability of the textile are especially critical in soft robotics, as they offer a greater range of motion and expanded design possibilities for creating more dynamic, functional actuators. Despite the importance of textile-based soft inflatables, current fabrication methods are still predom- inantly manual, which presents several challenges in terms 1SDU Soft Robotics, Biorobotics Section, The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark (SDU), 5230 Odense M, Denmark (email: {argo, bseyi, spmb, aidap, cdd, ahra}@sdu.dk) \u2217Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \u2020These authors contributed equally to this work Fig. 1.

One commonly used approach involves using a laser cutter to cut the textile and later fuse the layers with a heat press while using masking layers for creating air pouches [15]. In this method, the laser cutter shapes the textile layers, while the masking layer protects specific areas from being bonded during the heat-pressing process. While this method can produce precise bonds, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly for complex patterns that require meticulous masking. Removing the masking layer after sealing can be problematic, often leading to imperfections that reduce overall efficiency and precision. Additionally, there is a risk that the intricate masking layers may prevent bonding at critical points, leading to leaks and malfunctioning samples. Several studies have proposed alternative methods for fusing textile layers without the need for masking. Amiri Moghadam et al. used a laser cutting machine to fuse 37 \u00b5m thin TPU- coated textiles, achieving a variety of motions [16]. Ren et al. employed infrared lasers to weld thin polyamide sheets laminated with TPU, creating complex inflatable structures and geometries [17]. While these methods show promise, using laser cutters to fuse textiles introduces limitations on material thickness and the types of materials that can be fused. Further- more, precise laser tuning is essential, as too much power can cut through the textile, while insufficient power may result in inadequate sealing. A promising approach for automating the fabrication of inflatable textile actuators involves using com- puter numerical control (CNC) machines equipped with heat- sealing elements to create complex geometries [18]. Niiyama et al. [19] used a CNC gantry holding a heat pencil to draw sealing lines on thermoplastic sheets, while Sanchez et al. [20] applied a similar technique to fabricate airbags for human- robot interaction. Ou et al. [21] created a large scale robotic sealing platform to create inflatable origami structures and sub- arXiv:2502.06361v1 [cs.RO] 10 Feb 2025"
