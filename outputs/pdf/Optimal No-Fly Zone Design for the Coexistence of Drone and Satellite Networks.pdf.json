  "abstract": "\u2014Constructing a no-fly zone (NFZ) is a straightfor- ward and effective way to facilitate the coexistence of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and existing systems (typically satellite systems). However, there has been little work on understanding the optimal design of such NFZs. In the absence of this design, one invariably ends up overestimating this region, hence significantly limiting the allowed airspace for the drones. To optimize the volume of the NFZ, we formulate this task as a variational problem and utilize the calculus of variations to rigorously obtain the NFZ as a function of the antenna pattern of victim receivers and the spatial distribution of drones. This approach parallels the matched filter design in the sense that the NFZ extends in directions where the antenna gain and/or the density of drones is high. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimal design compared to the known baselines in reducing the volume of the NFZ without compromising the protective performance.

INTRODUCTION Enabling the coexistence of drones and existing communica- tions systems is crucial for the efficient utilization of spectrum. Due to their large coverage footprints, drones can generate high aggregate interference to the ground-based infrastructure. Satellite systems with ground stations (GSs) pointing upwards are particularly susceptible to such interference even when the drones operate in the adjacent bands. This scenario constitutes the main setting of interest in this paper. A straightforward but largely effective way to safeguard such highly sensitive ground nodes is to create a no-fly zone (NFZ) around them. The NFZ is a designated geographic area where drone operations are either restricted or entirely prohibited. It essentially enforces a minimum required separation distance between drones and GSs. Regulatory bodies have provided initial guidance on this minimum separation distance for various systems. For instance, drones operating in the 1710-1785 MHz range can potentially interfere with Meteorological Satellite (MetSat) systems operating in the 1675-1710 MHz. Accordingly, the regulatory measures require a minimum separation distance of 30 km for drones operating on the first adjacent channel to MetSat systems [1]. While this idea has been discussed from the regulatory perspective, quite remarkably, there has been little work on understanding the optimal design of such NFZs. X. Tu and H. S.

In the absence of this design, one invariably overestimates this zone, leading to unnecessary large NFZs that significantly limit the operational airspace for drones. For example, even with the \u221240 dBm/MHz emission limit for drones, the re- quired minimum separation distance can extend to 1.4 km. In practice, NFZs are typically implemented in the form of domes or cylinders, with the minimum separation distance determining their radius. With this separation distance extend- ing over dozens of kilometers, the resulting NFZ imposes significant restrictions on the operational space for drones. The shapes of these NFZs, typically domes, are selected based on the assumption of a uniform interference risk around the victim receiver. However, this assumption is usually highly conservative given that satellite systems often use directional antennas. Consequently, the minimum separation distance can be reduced for drones positioned outside the main lobe of the GS antennas. This implies that the separation distance should be designed based on the spatial distribution of drones relative to the antenna pattern of the GSs. This approach is particularly appealing when the antenna pattern remains fixed for an ex- tended time. Generally, assuming that the separation distance varies continuously with the elevation and azimuth angle in 3D space, the NFZ is the region delineated by the minimum separation distance, as denoted by the red part in Fig. 1. In addition to spatial separation, spectral separation methods such as guard bands and frequency masks are employed to reduce interference between systems. By optimizing frequency and distance separation jointly, it is feasible to further reduce the volume of NFZs, which is also explored in this paper. The coexistence of drone and satellite systems has been extensively explored in the literature, e.g., see [2]\u2013[6]. The usual approach to facilitating this coexistence is through spatial and/or spectral separation, both of which are interesting to this paper. Spatial separation results in the formation of NFZ, also termed exclusion regions or guard zones. The improvement in performance through spatial separation has been studied recently in [7], [8], which investigates the mini- mum distance separation for satellite systems coexisting with drones, a problem of particular interest to us. Along the same lines, the authors of [9] have studied the use of circular secrecy guard zones to balance protecting the confidentiality of the primary users while ensuring that the secondary devices harvest sufficient energy from the radio frequency transmis- sions of the primary network. Beyond communications-related interference, the idea of guard zones has also been applied to avoid physical collisions between drones and other aircraft or facilities, where it is termed geofencing [10], [11].
