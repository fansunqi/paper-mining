  "abstract": "This article explores the rational solutions of the Half-Wave Maps equation in the non- singular spectrum case, demonstrating their global-in-time existence and systematic scat- tering. We begin by describing a scattering framework, establishing equivalent characteriza- tions, and identifying a su\ufb03cient local condition that guarantees scattering over in\ufb01nite time scales. Next, we construct initial conditions that lead to solutions scattering inde\ufb01nitely, for any given number of solitons and any prescribed spectrum of speeds, with arbitrarily small deviations. Furthermore, we prove that any rational solution with a distinct spectrum scatters in Sobolev norm to a sum of solitons, each characterized by a constant spin and a pole moving at a constant velocity. Lastly, we provide an algebraic characterization of traveling waves and establish that a solution cannot scatter to a traveling map without itself being in a traveling state for \ufb01nite times.
