We take into account several realistic factors, including the kSZ optical depth degeneracy. Our baseline setup consists of CMB S4 temperature and polarization (but not lensing) information, DESI BAO, the LSST galaxy power spectrum, and a Planck like \u03c4 prior, yielding \u03c3(P m\u03bd) = 32 meV. Adding kSZ tomography improves this by a few percent, while a kSZ optical depth prior can push this improvement to over 15%, giving \u03c3(P m\u03bd) = 27 meV. When CMB lensing is included in the baseline setup, kSZ does not further improve neutrino mass constraints. We find promising prospects for a scenario combining futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys. I. INTRODUCTION The determination of the total neutrino mass is among the most highly anticipated targets of forthcoming cos- mological surveys [1\u20135]. Neutrinos, among the least un- derstood elements of the Standard Model, play a critical role in both cosmology and astrophysics. Understanding their fundamental properties remains a central challenge in particle physics. Precision measurements of neutrino flavor oscillations have accurately constrained the mass- squared differences between neutrino mass eigenstates, implying that the total mass of neutrinos must exceed 0.058 eV (see e.g. [6, 7]). This threshold represents a robust target within the standard cosmological model, offering a clear and testable objective for future obser- vational campaigns. However, the small masses of neu- trinos and their relativistic nature until late times lead to subtle effects on cosmological observables, making it challenging to isolate the neutrino signal from the effects of other parameters and uncertainties. Therefore, de- veloping alternative methods to detect neutrino masses is not a straightforward endeavor that can be achieved without significant effort and innovation. Furthermore, the most precise cosmological constraints on the total neutrino mass, obtained through analyses of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscil- lations (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) [8], suggest a puzzling value below the lower bound established by neutrino flavor oscillation ex- periments [9], which may also be related to other anoma- lies in cosmology [10, 11]. The precise measurement of the sum of neutrino masses remains a significant, timely challenge, which motivates the integration of diverse and complementary data and methods [e.g. 12\u201314]. Here, we explore the potential of a novel approach that combines \u2217atishue@illinois.edu measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev Zel\u2019dovich (kSZ) effect [15\u201317] in the CMB with galaxy survey data. Measurement of the kSZ effect is poised to offer a po- tentially powerful new probe of cosmology in the coming decade: the next generation of cosmic microwave back- ground (CMB) experiments such as the Simons Obser- vatory (SO) [4], Advanced SO (Adv. SO) [5] and CMB S4 [3], and galaxy surveys such as DESI [2] and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (VRO LSST) [1] will generate a wealth of new data with unprecedented precision on small scales. Interactions of CMB photons with the intervening large-scale struc- ture induce correlations between CMB anisotropies and galaxy densities that carry valuable cosmological infor- mation [e.g. 18\u201339]. In addition to the kSZ effect, these interactions include thermal SZ effect [15, 40\u201343], the in- tegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect [44], which include the mov- ing lens effect [45\u201351], and weak gravitational lensing (see e.g. [52] for a review). In particular, both the kSZ and moving lens effects are sourced due to peculiar motions of cosmological structure, making them useful probes of fundamental physics that affect the density field and the growth rate, a key example of which is massive neutrinos. Massive neutrinos delay and suppress the growth of cosmological structure on scales below the neutrino sound horizon. This makes the cosmological growth rate and various cosmic observables sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses P m\u03bd. The sensitivity of cosmolog- ical fluctuations to massive neutrinos can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, where we show the fractional change in the lensing potential and the galaxy and velocity power spectra and growth factor f(k) due to the varying neu- trino mass compared to the fiducial value of the normal hierarchy P m\u03bd = 0.06 eV. The effect on these power spectra reaches 1-10% on small scales k \u223c10\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (\u2113\u223c104). Therefore, these observables provide impor- tant probes of P m\u03bd.
