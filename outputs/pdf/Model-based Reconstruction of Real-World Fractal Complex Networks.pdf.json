  "abstract": "By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man- made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and densities. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorpo- rates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model\u2019s applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks. INTRODUCTION Fractal complex networks constitute a remarkable and intriguing class of complex networks that are distin- guished by their self-similarity and power-law scaling properties across a wide range of scales [1\u20134]. These net- works are not confined to theoretical constructs; they appear ubiquitously in both natural and man-made sys- tems. Examples include biological networks, such as neu- ronal or vascular systems, where structural and func- tional organization often reflects fractal-like patterns [5], the World Wide Web, which demonstrates hierarchical and scale-free properties [1], and social networks, where communities often form self-similar clusters [6\u20138]. Modeling fractal networks is crucial to discovering the fundamental principles that govern the organization and evolution of these systems. Fractal network models pro- vide a framework for studying processes such as infor- mation flow [9], robustness [10], and spreading dynamics [11], which are deeply influenced by the network\u2019s struc- ture. By accurately modeling fractal networks, we can design more efficient and resilient infrastructures, predict behaviors in natural and engineered systems, and better understand the interplay between topology and function in such environments. The primary feature distinguishing fractal networks from non-fractal networks is the power-law relationship between the network size N and its diameter L in the form: N \u223cLdB, where the exponent dB is referred to as the fractal dimension [4]. Non-fractal networks are char- acterized rather by an exponential relationship, N \u223ceL, and, due to short distances between nodes, are commonly known as small-world networks. When defining complex fractal networks, one must pro- ceed carefully, as there exist fractal networks that are not complex (e.g., road networks [12] or random graph models at the percolation threshold [1]). Likewise, there are complex networks that, like fractal networks, exhibit scale-invariance in their degree distribution (such as the famous Barab\u00b4asi-Albert (BA) evolving network model [13]), but are not structurally self-similar under renor- malization and their size grows exponentially with the diameter [1]. The aforementioned renormalization is a process in which nodes in the network are grouped into \u201dboxes\u201d based on a predefined distance, and these groups are treated as super-nodes in a newly constructed net- work. Remarkably, fractal networks preserve their sta- tistical properties through such successive renormaliza- tions, demonstrating self-similarity that can be quanti- tatively analyzed [1, 9]. For example, the degree distri- bution P(k) as well as the distribution of the normal- ized masses of boxes P(\u00b5) \u223c\u00b5\u03b4 retain their power-law character both before and after renormalization [8]. This property sets them apart from other types of networks, such as small-world networks, which lack such explicit self-similarity under renormalization. To avoid misunderstandings, in this work, we define complex fractal networks as those that possess a well- defined fractal dimension dB, a power-law distributions P(k) and P(\u00b5), and are structurally self-similar under renormalization. Since in real-world networks it is generally infeasible to directly analyze the relationship between their size and diameter (which remain unchanged), the most com- mon method for determining the fractal dimension dB is through the box-covering procedure [15, 16]. This method yields a relationship between the number of boxes NB required to cover the network and the size (di- ameter) of each box lB, expressed as: NB(lB) \u221dl\u2212dB B . (1) Although the first models of fractal networks appeared at the beginning of this century, they remain relatively scarce and are limited in their properties. Despite the inevitable randomness inherent in the evolution of real fractal networks, most existing models are deterministic [2, 17\u201320]. In a few exceptions, such as models based on random walks [21, 22] construction method appears arXiv:2502.04186v1 [physics.soc-ph] 6 Feb 2025"
