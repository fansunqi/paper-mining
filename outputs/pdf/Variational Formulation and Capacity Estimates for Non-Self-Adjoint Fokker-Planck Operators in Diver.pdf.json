  "title": "Variational Formulation and Capacity Estimates for Non-Self-Adjoint Fokker-Planck Operators in Diver.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We introduce a variational formulation for a general class of possibly degenerate, non-self-adjoint Fokker-Planck operators in divergence form, motivated by the work of Albritton et al. (2024), and prove that it is suitable for de\ufb01ning the variational capacity. Using this frame- work, we establish rough estimates for the equilibrium potential in the elliptic case, providing a novel approach compared to previous methods. Finally, we derive the Eyring-Kramers formula for non-self-adjoint elliptic Fokker-Planck operators in divergence form, extending the results of Landim et al. (2019) and Lee & Seo (2022). Contents 1.

Introduction and Main Results In this paper, we introduce a variational capacity formulation for a general class of Fokker- Planck-Kolmogorov equations in divergence form. Additionally, we prove the Eyring-Kramers formula in elliptic, non-reversible cases. The operator we study is given by, for z \u2208Rd, L\u03b5f(z) = \u03b5eW/\u03b5\u2207\u00b7 h e\u2212W/\u03b5A\u2207f i + (b + Bz) \u00b7 \u2207f, (1.1) where W(z) : Rd \u2192R is a con\ufb01ning potential that is di\ufb00erentiable, and \u03b5 is a parameter corresponding to thermal noise. Moreover, A(z) is a matrix, b(z) : Rd \u2192Rd is a vector \ufb01eld, Mingyi Hou, Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University, 751 05 Uppsala, Sweden E-mail address: mingyi.hou@math.uu.se.
