  "abstract": ". Low-code development frameworks for IoT platforms offer a simple drag-and-drop mechanism to create applications for the billions of existing IoT devices without the need for extensive programming knowl- edge. The security of such software is crucial given the close integration of IoT devices in many highly sensitive areas such as healthcare or home automation. Node-RED is such a framework, where applications are built from nodes that are contributed by open-source developers. Its reliance on unvetted open-source contributions and lack of security checks raises the concern that the applications could be vulnerable to attacks, thereby imposing a security risk to end users. The low-code approach suggests, that many users could lack the technical knowledge to mitigate, under- stand, or even realize such security concerns. This paper focuses on hidden information flows in Node-RED nodes, meaning flows that are not captured by the specifications. They could (unknowingly or with malicious intent) cause leaks of sensitive informa- tion to unauthorized entities. We report the results of a conformance analysis of all nodes in the Node-RED framework, for which we com- pared the numbers of specified inputs and outputs of each node against the number of sources and sinks detected with CodeQL. The results show, that 55% of all nodes exhibit more possible flows than are specified. A risk assessment of a subset of the nodes showed, that 28% of them are associated with a high severity and 36% with a medium severity rating.
