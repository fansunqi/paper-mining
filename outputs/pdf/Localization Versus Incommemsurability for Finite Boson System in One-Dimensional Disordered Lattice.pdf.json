(Dated: February 21, 2025) We explore the effect of disorder on a few-boson system in a finite one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential covering the full interaction ranging from uncorrelated to strongly correlated particles. We apply numerically exact multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons to obtain the few-body emergent states in a finite lattice for both commensurate and incommensurate filling fac- tors. The detailed characterization is done by the measures of one- and two-body correlations, fragmentation, order parameter. For commensurate filling, we trace the conventional fingerprints of disorder induced localization in the weakly interacting limit, however we observe robustness of fragmented and strongly correlated Mott in the disordered lattice. For filling factor smaller than one, we observe existing delocalization fraction of particles interplay in a complex way. For strongly interacting limit, the introduced disorder drags the fragmented superfluid of primary lattice to Mott localization. For filling factor larger than one in the primary lattice, the extra delocalization always resides on commensurate background of Mott-insulator. We observe beyond Bose-Hubbard physics in the fermionization limit when the pairing bosons fragment into two orbitals- Mott dimerization happens. The introduced disorder first relocates the dimers, then strong disorder starts to interfere with the background Mott correlation. These findings unlock a rich landscape of unexplored lo- calization process in the quasiperiodic potentials and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum many-body states with ultracold atoms. I. INTRODUCTION The flexible controlling in optical lattice enables the investigation of the most remarkable paradigmatic phase transition from coherent superfluid (SF) to localized Mott-insulator (MI) phase [1\u20133]. The MI character- izes exotic quantum phenomenon like fractional quan- tum hall effect [4], metal-insulator phase transition in the strongly correlated quantum matter [5], topological phase transition [6]. It further includes many-body lo- calization [7, 8], Bose glass (BG) phases [1, 9\u201312], fractal Mott lobes [11, 13, 14], Anderson localization [15\u201319] in disordered lattice. Experimentally, disorder can be intro- duced by a bichromatic potential [10, 20]. A quasiperi- odic potential is formed by a main optical lattice of high intensity superposed by a second weaker one with slightly different wave length, the resulting lattice displays local inhomogeneities. The phase diagrams of quasiperiodic systems with two periodic lattices of incommensurate pe- riod have been theoretically studied both in one and two dimensions [13, 21\u201323]. Controlled quasiperiodic poten- tials are also realized in the experiments with ultracold atoms [24\u201328]. The one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice is the most versatile platform to understand localization versus de- localization. For the commensurate filling, interacting bosons in the regular periodic lattice exhibits incompress- ible Mott insulating phase, whereas for the incommensu- rate filling an extended superfluid with global correlation \u2217barnali.physics@presiuniv.ac.in is expected. When bosons in the periodic lattice shows a transition from MI to SF phase, in the disordered lattice, the MI to SF transition is intercepted by a compress- ible but non-coherent phase-Bose Glass phase. In recent studies, the interplay between commensuration and lo- calization has been studied both theoretically and exper- imentally [14, 29]. It has been illustrated that when the number of particles commensurate with the number of lattice sites, a localized Mott phase in the periodic lattice turns to delocalized superfluid in the quasiperiodic lat- tice [14]. It is claimed that the anomalous delocalization is introduced due to interplay between the interaction and commensuration. Whereas Ref. [29] presents the ex- pected features for weakly correlated Mott, but strongly correlated Mott exhibits stringent competition between Mott correlation and correlation due to disorder, which results to melting of Mott localization. In this paper, we consider a few-boson ensemble in a finite 1D quasiperiodic lattice with various incommensu- rable setups. The motivation is to understand how the delocalization due to incommensurate fraction of parti- cles in the periodic lattice competes to the localization introduced by disorder in the quasiperiodic lattice. The scenario is different whether the filling factor is less than or more than one. For filling factor less than one, the de- localization is justified due to poor population. For filling factor more than one, there is extra delocalized particles sitting on the commensurate background of localized par- ticles. The challenging question is how the disorder in- troduced by the secondary incommensurate lattice will interplay with the existing delocalized fraction of parti- cles in the primary lattice and determine the localization process. arXiv:2502.14440v1 [cond-mat.quant-gas] 20 Feb 2025"
