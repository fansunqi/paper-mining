  "title": "Identifying Gender Stereotypes and Biases in Automated Translation from English to Italian Using Sim.pdf",
  "abstract": ". This paper is a collaborative effort between Linguistics, Law, and Computer Science to evaluate stereotypes and biases in automated translation systems. We advocate gender-neutral translation as a means to promote gender inclusion and improve the objectivity of machine translation. Our approach focuses on identifying gender bias in English- to-Italian translations. First, we define gender bias following human rights law and linguistics literature. Then we proceed by identifying gender-specific terms such as she/lei and he/lui as key elements. We then evaluate the cosine similarity between these target terms and oth- ers in the dataset to reveal the model\u2019s perception of semantic relations. Using numerical features, we effectively evaluate the intensity and di- rection of the bias. Our findings provide tangible insights for developing and training gender-neutral translation algorithms.

Among these tasks, Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most widely used yet critical applications [1]. The integration of Artificial intelligence (AI) into translation services has undoubtedly facilitated cross-cultural communication and nowadays automated translation providers are widely used in every industry. For example, today Google Translate, the multilingual neural machine transla- tion service developed by Google, has over 610 million users per day. Despite the undeniable usefulness of such technologies, the existence of gender biases and stereotypes in MT is a fact [2]. arXiv:2502.11611v1 [cs.CL] 17 Feb 2025"
