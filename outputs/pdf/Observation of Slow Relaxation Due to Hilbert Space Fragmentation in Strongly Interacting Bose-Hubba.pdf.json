  "abstract": "A notable mechanism of such nonergodicity is the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF), where the Hamiltonian matrix splits into an exponentially large num- ber of sectors due to the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities. Using ultracold gases, here we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interac- tion. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge-density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing-down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation. Our results provide the first experimental confirmation of the conserved quantities responsible for HSF. INTRODUCTION The problem of quantum thermalization, i.e., how iso- lated quantum many-body systems which undergo the reversible unitary time evolution can reach thermal equi- librium states, lies at the heart of modern quantum sta- tistical physics and is of considerable recent interest. As a mechanism of the thermalization, the eigenstate ther- malization hypothesis (ETH) is known, which states that expectation values of physical quantities for eigenstates of a quantum many-body system coincide with that of the microcanonical ensemble in the corresponding energy [1\u20134]. Especially, when a quantum many-body system satisfies the strong version of the ETH, where all of the eigenstates satisfy the ETH, the long-time average of the physical quantity coincides with the microcanonical av- erage, that is, the system thermalizes [5, 6]. The remarkable progress of artificial quantum systems, such as ultracold gases, Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits, has enabled indispens- able studies on the problem of the thermalization from both experimental and theoretical sides. In better un- derstanding of the mechanisms of the thermalization, the investigation of nonergodic systems, which do not show thermalization, is important. Illustrative examples of nonergodic systems include integrable [7\u201312] and many- body localized (MBL) systems [13\u201325], where thermal- ization is prevented due to the presence of an extensive number of conserved quantities and the strong disorder potential, respectively. Furthermore, the recent findings of another type of nonergodic systems show the diver- sity of origins of nonergodic behavior, as exemplified by quantum many-body scar [26\u201335], Stark MBL [36\u201339] and Hilbert-space fragmentation (HSF) [40\u201347]. In particular, HSF typically results from the presence of nontrivial conserved quantities, leading to strong ki- netic constraints on the system. Under such constraints, the Hilbert space is fragmented into an exponentially large number of disconnected subsectors (Krylov subsec- tors), where the dynamics are restricted to only a few of subsectors, causing the system not to thermalize. Exper- imentally, the nonergodic dynamics due to the HSF have been observed, especially in the one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Hubbard system [42, 43] and the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system [47], where linear potential gra- dients (tilt potentials) are applied, and the total atom number and dipole moment are conserved. Theoreti- cally, a disorder-free 1D Bose-Hubbard model with no trapping potential [48, 49] and with a trapping potential [37, 50, 51] has been studied. Especially in Ref. [51], it has been reported that the nonergodic behavior emerges in the strongly interacting regime when the dynamics start from a period-two charge-density wave (CDW) of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) (see Fig. 1(a)- (b)), while rapid relaxation occurs starting from that of singlons. In this system, in addition to the total atom number, the numbers of doublons and singlons are emergent conserved quantities in the strongly interacting regime, which gives rise to HSF. In this work, using ultracold Bose gases in optical lat- tices, we explore the role of interatomic interaction in the nonequilibrium dynamics following the sudden quench of the optical-lattice depth starting from a particular ini- tial state of a period two CDW of doublons with a small portion of singlons in a 1D disorder-free Bose-Hubbard system with no tilt potential (See Fig. 1).
