  "abstract": "- Technology is currently ubiquitous and is also part of the educational system at all levels. It started with communication technology systems, and later continued with digital competence. Nowadays, although these previous concepts are still in force and are useful for students and workers in general, a new concept has been born that can function as a cross-curricular competence called Computational Thinking. There is currently no consensus on the definition of computational thinking, nor on the classification of its skills, but there is a consensus that it refers to a set of skills necessary for the formulation and resolution of problems. The study of Computational Thinking has been very influential in recent years in research on teaching and learning processes, which has led educational institutions to begin to address these issues during training. In this paper, we try to introduce this new cross-curricular competence and expose a project of implementation of Computational Thinking in engineering careers through Calculus subject. Keywords: Computational Thinking, Education, Engineering, Competences, Curriculum. 1. INTRODUCTION The irruption of computational thinking in the educational system is becoming more and more notorious, with its inclusion in the curricula of several countries [1, 2], and as a current topic in research [3-5]. In recent decades, society has been transformed at all levels: social, economic, cultural and also educational. The influence initially of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and later of digital competence, in this transformation is undeniable, as well as the uncertainty that all this creates when talking about the future [6]. On the other hand, in recent years there has been an increased interest in the teaching of computer science in pre-university educational stages, both for purely educational and economic reasons [7, 8]. Moreover, in different educational settings across countries, a consensus is emerging on the importance of computer science education, and that it should not be limited to the development of digital competence. Thus, students should also acquire basic knowledge of computer science as a science and technology [9, 10]. National responses to the requirements for students to acquire digital and computing competencies are very varied [11-13], ranging from compulsory computer science subjects in national or regional curricula to informal or non-formal initiatives to their cross-curricular teaching. At the university stage, the learning of the contents of Computer Science as a basic science in Engineering is usually focused on contributing to develop in students of Engineering careers in general the ability to build the solution of problems with the computer (through the ingenuity of algorithms and their codification as programs) [14]. The greatest cognitive challenge faced by students is the discovery of an effective and efficient algorithm that solves the problem posed [15]. The objectives of this type of subjects related to Computer Science can generally be grouped into four main blocks. In the first, the student is expected to understand the fundamentals of current technology and how it influences computer design. In the second, the student should gain an understanding of how system software controls the operation of a computer and establishes the basic communication paths between a machine and the people who use it, and how computers can be connected to share information and resources. The third block is concerned with training the student to discover and represent algorithms as programs, applying the divide-and-conquer principle and successive refinements, and instilling in him the search for efficiency and checking for correctness and completeness. The fourth block is usually devoted to the programming process, to the communication of algorithms to computers, currently using languages such as Python, studying also the design of data to represent information and manipulate it with the greatest efficiency, and the effective presentation of information to the user. The year 2006 saw the emergence of a new concept, computational thinking, which over the years has made its way as a new cross-curricular competence in the educational system of most countries in the world. 2.
