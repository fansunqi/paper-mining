  "abstract": "Robots extend beyond the tools of productivity; they also contribute to creative activities. Although typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored.

ACM ISBN 979-8-4007-1394-1/25/04 https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713327 examines how robots participate in artistic creation. Through semi- structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dy- namics in facilitating creativity. Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we pro- pose several implications for socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing sys- tems. These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible com- puting. arXiv:2502.01795v1 [cs.HC] 3 Feb 2025"
