Neuromorphic computing utilizing correlated oxides offers an energy-efficient solution. By designing anisotropic functional properties in LSMO on a twinned LAO substrate and driving it out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we demonstrate two distinct neg- ative differential resistance states in such volatile memristors. These were harnessed to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in LSMO at dif- ferent frequencies and an artificial neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics. A material based modelling incorporating bond angle distortions in neighboring perovskites and capturing the inhomogeneity of domain distribution and propagation explains both the NDR regimes. Our findings establish LSMO as an important material for neuromorphic computing hardware. 1 Introduction The high volume of consumer network, that precipitously rose, during the world-wide stay-at-home or- ders, few years ago, brought to light the urgent need to redefine computing hardware with low power footprint. In this, neuromorphic computing has gained steep interest due to the energy-efficient solu- tion capabilities that new materials, such as oxides, offer for in-memory computing. For such non von Neumann computing approaches, correlated properties intrinsic to the oxides are commonly exploited. However, at the hardware level, these properties have been less explored for demonstrating the rich non- linear phenomenon present in biological systems. The emergence of collective order is the cornerstone of the class of correlated oxides [1], primarily stemming from strain tailoring at heterointerfaces and the in- tricate coupling between charge, spin, orbital, and lattice [2\u20136]. Manganites with their intrinsic chemical inhomogeneities and complex phase diagrams are particularly relevant. Electronic transport in mangan- ites is susceptible to external stimuli and leads to inhomogeneous spatial distribution of electronic phases with varying local properties [7\u201312]. These coexisting and competing phases collectively result in non- linear responses of the order parameter, important for realizing nanoelectronic devices [13]. By driving such systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium, electrically or optically, such non-linear phenomena are realized, widening the repertoire of emergent properties. Here we design anisotropic functional properties in strained thin films of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO), a well-established correlated oxide in the manganite family, by uniquely accommodating variations in the local octahedral tilts, across a twinned substrate of LaAlO3 (LAO), with bond angle variations ranging from 180\u25e6to 150\u25e6, at the adjacent atomic sites. Recent advancements in complex oxide engineering demonstrate an efficient control of oxygen octahe- dra coupling (OOC) at the film-substrate interface, at the atomic scale [14, 15] , however their coopera- tive impact on the electronic properties remains unexplored. We utilize this to demonstrate a non-linear 1 arXiv:2502.00137v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 31 Jan 2025"
