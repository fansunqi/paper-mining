  "title": "The Amplitude Decay of a Harmonic Oscillator Damped Simultaneously by Weak Linear and Nonlinear Damp.pdf",
  "abstract": "Our derivation is based on a basic understanding of the undamped harmonic oscillator and the connection between the energy dissi- pation rate and the power of the total damping force. By comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak damping by combinations of these three forces for an experimentally relevant range of corresponding damping constants. The physical concepts and mathematical techniques we employ are suitable for undergraduate physics teaching. I. INTRODUCTION In undergraduate physics textbooks, see, e.g., [1\u20134], the damping of harmonic oscillations is considered only in the case of viscous damping, i.e. for a damping force linear in velocity. The damping force of constant magnitude and the damping force quadratic in velocity are covered only in the context of unidirectional motions such as sliding on an inclined plane with friction [1\u20133] and the motion of a free falling object with air resistance [2, 3], while the analysis of the influence of these forces on the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator is omitted. The reason for this is that these two damping forces require a mathematical treatment that is demanding for undergraduates, while on the other hand the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator damped by a force linear in velocity can be analyzed in a fashion known to students, i.e. the solution of the corresponding equation of motion can be written analytically in a closed form valid for all times, and such a solution is easy to analyze. In case of a harmonic oscillator damped with sliding friction (often called Coulomb damping), the corresponding equation of motion can be solved exactly by splitting the motion into left and right moving segments [5\u20138], i.e. the motion needs to be analyzed over half-cycles and the solution thus obtained cannot be put in a closed form valid for all times. Furthermore, in the case of sliding friction, the oscillations generally do not halt at the equilibrium position, which cannot be directly read from the exact solution of the equation of motion, but it is necessary to additionally analyze the instant of the halt [5\u20138]. In the case of a harmonic oscillator damped with air resistance, the corresponding equation of motion is a nonlinear differential equation that cannot be solved analytically and approximate or numerical methods must be used [7, 9\u201311]. Even in the simplest real-world systems, damping of vibrations is caused by combinations of two or all three of the above forces, with each of them contributing to damping to a greater or lesser extent depending on the specifics of the system. For example, in [12] a simple physical pendulum was studied, both experimentally and theoretically, and it was shown that the contribution of all three forces, i.e. sliding friction in the pendulum support and air resistance with both linear and quadratic terms in velocity, must be taken into account for an adequate general description of pendulum damping, while in some specific cases two (out of three) damping forces were sufficient. The damping of harmonic oscillations by the combined action of sliding friction and viscous damping, as well as the combination of viscous and quadratic damping, has been investigated by many authors. For example, the amplitude decay in the case of free vibrations with combined Coulomb and viscous damping was first derived under no-stop conditions in [13], while the theory of amplitude decay presented in [14] takes into account the stopping of dynamics with an offset from the equilibrium position. The exact theory of the discontinuities in the acceleration of such systems is given and experimentally verified in [15]. In the case of combined linear and quadratic damping, the approximate analytical expression for amplitude decay was derived using the work energy theorem, i.e. the energy dissipated due to damping over the first half period, already in [16], while numerical methods are routinely used, see, e.g., [17]. \u2217Corresponding author: klelas@ttf.unizg.hr \u2020Electronic address: rpezer@simet.hr arXiv:2502.07458v1 [physics.class-ph] 11 Feb 2025"
