However, device integration at the wafer scale necessarily depends on having a reliable, high-fidelity, and high-yield fabrication method for creating Josephson junctions. When creating Al/AlOx based superconducting qubits, the standard Josephson junction fabrication method relies on a sub-micron suspended resist bridge, known as a Dolan bridge, which tends to be particularly fragile and can often times fracture during the resist development process, ultimately resulting in device failure. In this work, we demonstrate a unique Josephson junction lithography mask design that incorporates stress-relief channels. Our simulation results show that the addition of stress-relief channels reduces the lateral stress in the Dolan bridge by more than 70% for all the bridge geometries investigated. In practice, our novel mask design significantly increased the survivability of the bridge during device processing, resulting in 100% yield for over 100 Josephson junctions fabricated.

INTRODUCTION Owing to their nonlinear inductance properties, Joseph- son junctions (JJs) are central to many quantum informa- tion (QI) systems,1,2 such as superconducting quantum in- terference devices (SQUIDS)3 and superconducting qubits.4,5 The standard JJs used in superconducting qubits are based on the Al/AlOx material system. When viewed in cross-section, these Al/AlOx JJs are comprised of two overlapping Al super- conductors that are separated by a thin AlOx tunneling barrier. When coupled with a capacitor, these junctions, either solitary or paired to fashion a SQUID, form an anharmonic oscillator with broken energy level degeneracy that enables the creation of a quasi two-level system, the transmon6. A standard, self- aligned JJ lithography mask consists of two perpendicularly oriented fingers (Fig. 1(a) (inset)) that, when patterned on a bilayer resist stack, result in the formation of a very narrow Dolan bridge7,8. Because the Dolan bridge is fragile and no- toriously prone to fracture 9 as shown in Fig. 1(a), the chal- lenge is to fabricate JJs reliably at scale. The most common state-of-the-art fabrication methods that help to preserve the integrity of the Dolan Bridge rely on cold development tech- niques10\u201313 with a low ultrasonication power10, the use of or- thogonal resists14,15, and techniques that go beyond the use of Dolan Bridges, such as the Manhattan style 10,16,17 and the bridge-free methods18\u201320. However, these more reliable fab- rication methods are also fairly cumbersome and somewhat time-consuming to implement compared to using more com- monplace resists like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) at room temperature. Mechani- cally stress-induced fracturing of the Dolan bridge is thought to be the primary failure mechanism for standard, self-aligned lithography masks when using PMMA and MMA resists. To address this issue, we augment a self-aligned mask to include stress-relief channels on both sides of the Dolan bridge, which reduces stress locally. Our innovative JJ mask design allows for a simple and efficient fabrication approach to reliably pro- duce JJs with intact Dolan bridges at large scales. To demon- strate the reliability of our mask design, we fabricated over 100 JJs with \u223c100 nm critical feature sizes that exhibited no fractures. We performed finite-element simulations to exam- ine the mechanical behavior of JJ resist masks and to quantify the reduction in mechanical loading when using stress-relief channels. To characterize the performance of our stress re- lieved JJ fabrication in a typical QI device, we fabricated a transmon qubit using the stress-relief lithography mask de- sign we discuss here and measured its properties at dilution refrigerator temperatures. II. DEVICE FABRICATION Our JJs were fabricated using a double-angle evaporation technique, the most common JJ fabrication process, to cre- ate an Al/AlOx/Al material stack.7,10,16,21 The fabrication pro- cess starts by spin-coating a bilayer resist stack comprised of a 760 nm-thick MMA EL 13 film and a 180 nm-thick 950 PMMA A3 layer on top of a Si substrate. We then patterned the resist using electron beam lithography at an acceleration voltage of 30 keV and developed the resist in a methyl isobutyl ketone:isopropyl alcohol (MIBK:IPA) solution, which selec- tively undercuts the MMA, leaving behind a thin, suspended PMMA layer (the Dolan bridge), as seen in Fig. 1(b, i). To remove any PMMA residue from the Si substrate, the sam- ple underwent an oxygen plasma etch (100 W, 2 min.), and immediately thereafter it was loaded into an e-beam evapo- rator for metallization. After pumping to a base pressure of 1x10\u22127 Torr, a 20 nm-thick layer of Al was deposited normal to the substrate surface (Fig. 1(b, ii)). Immediately after evap- oration, the chamber was flooded with O2 to create a static O2 background at a pressure of 500 mTorr for 10 minutes to oxi- dize the Al, forming a thin (\u223c10\u00c5) layer of AlOx that serves arXiv:2502.00255v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 1 Feb 2025"
