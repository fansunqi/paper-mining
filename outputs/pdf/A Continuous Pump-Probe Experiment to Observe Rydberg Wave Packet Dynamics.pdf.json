Fischer1 1Physics Department and LAMOR, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO 65409, USA (Dated: February 11, 2025) Rydberg atoms remain in the limelight due to their applications in quantum optics and information technologies. In this work, the dynamics of Rydberg atoms stored in a momentum spectrometer by an all-optical trap is studied by ionizing them in the field of a continuous wave optical dipole trap. While the addition of the optical dipole trap allows to further cool the atoms, it comes at the expense of the time of flight information which is required to retrieve photoelectron momentum distributions. Here, we report on a method that extends the standard COLTRIMS (cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy) technique, including continuous wave lasers in pump-probe schemes, by utilizing coincidence measurements. In particular, the photoionization of atomic 6Li initially in a spin-polarized 22P3/2 state is explored. Multi-photon excitation from a tunable-mode femtosecond pulse is exploited to produce Rydberg atoms, which can then be ionized by the dipole field. The resulting ionization rate becomes explicitly time-dependent, and analyzing its structure unlocks the real-time atomic dynamics on nanosecond time scales. Time-resolved laser spectroscopy, along with high- resolution momentum imaging, provides detailed insights into the dynamics of atomic or molecular systems. Fem- tosecond pump-probe schemes were pioneered by A. Ze- wail [1] and they evolved into the gold standard for time- resolved spectroscopy. They were extensively used to study nuclear dynamics in molecular reactions on a fem- tosecond timescale (e.g. [2]). Shorter time scales be- came accessible with the availability of attosecond laser pulses created by high-harmonic generation [3\u20135] using streaking [6, 7], pump-probe [8\u201310], or the interferomet- ric RABBITT [7, 11\u201313] techniques. Nowadays, there is a wealth of time-resolved methods exploiting differ- ent types of light sources ranging from accelerator-sized free-electron lasers, to compact tabletop laser devices em- ploying advanced pulse shaping techniques, and spanning time-scales from the attosecond to the picosecond time regime. In this letter, we extend the toolbox for time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy by introducing a technique that is particularly simple and suited to studying slow nanosecond dynamics. In contrast to conventional pump- probe schemes, where the time information is obtained by scanning the delay between two pulses, we use a femtosec- ond pulse pump and a weak continuous wave (cw) probe; the latter can photoionize the excited atomic system at any time after the former. A cold target recoil ion mo- mentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS) [14\u201317] is employed to detect photoelectrons and recoiling target ions in co- incidence. In conventional COLTRIMS, the time infor- mation of the target ionization is required to calculate the fragments\u2019 momentum vectors. Although the atoms\u2019 time of ionization is not directly measurable within the continuous wave, we can recover this information by ex- ploiting the fact that the total momentum of all the tar- get fragments is zero after photoionization (neglecting the very small photon momentum). This approach does not only retain the photoelectron energy and angular dis- tributions, but it also provides additional information on the time evolution of the wave packet that is formed by the pump pulse. This method allows measurements of the electron\u2019s motion as it occurs in energetically narrow wave packets, e.g., in Rydberg atoms; such systems are important in the development and study of coherent con- trol schemes in ultra-cold atomic samples (e.g., [18, 19]). For this experiment, we measure the time evolution of magnetic Rydberg wave packets in a weak external field. Atomic 6Li gas is suspended in the laser light of a near-resonant all-optical trap (AOT) [20]. The AOT\u2019s configuration optically pumps the system, resulting in a population of about 25 % in the excited 22P3/2(F = 5/2) hyperfine state. Upwards of 93% of these excited atoms populate a single angular magnetic sublevel, m\u2113= \u22121, with respect to the quantization axis given by the spectrometer\u2019s magnetic field and corresponding z-axis. To populate the Rydberg states, a femtosecond light source was used, similar to that described in [21, 22], which is a commercially available optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifier (OPCPA). At its heart is a Ti:Sa oscillator which provides a broadband seed-signal for two noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) stages. For this study, the light source was tuned to emit pulses with a central wavelength, pulse width, and repetition rate of 735 \u00b1 10 nm, 50 fs, and 200 kHz, respectively. Unlike previous experiments (e.g. [23, 24]), the inten- sity of this source was kept below the threshold of direct few-photon ionization with a peak intensity of up to 1011 W/cm2. This beam is intersected with the AOT at an angle of 12.5\u25e6with respect to the z-axis. Finally, an optical dipole trap (ODT) is generated using an indus- trial grade ytterbium-doped fiber laser, which outputs a infrared continuous wave at 1070 \u00b1 5. This beam\u2019s po- larization and propagation directions lie in the xy-plane, and it reaches the reaction volume with an intensity of about 107 W/cm2.
