  "abstract": "Performativity, the phenomenon where outcomes are influenced by predictions, is particularly prevalent in social contexts where individuals strategically respond to a deployed model. In order to preserve the high accuracy of machine learning models under distribu- tion shifts caused by performativity, Perdomo et al. (2020) introduced the concept of performative risk min- imization (PRM). While this framework ensures model accuracy, it overlooks the impact of the PRM on the un- derlying distributions and the predictions of the model. In this paper, we initiate the analysis of the impact of PRM, by studying performativity for a sequential performative risk minimization problem with binary random variables and linear performative shifts. We formulate two natural measures of impact. In the case of full information, where the distribution dynamics are known, we derive explicit formulas for the PRM so- lution and our impact measures. In the case of partial information, we provide performative-aware statistical estimators, as well as simulations. Our analysis con- trasts PRM to alternatives that do not model data shift and indicates that PRM can have amplified side effects compared to such methods. 1 Introduction Predictions can significantly influence everyday life (Rodamar, 2018), an effect known as performativity. For instance, traffic predictions can alter people\u2019s daily routes, crime predictions can affect police resource al- location, and stock price predictions can steer traders\u2019 decisions. These changes can lead to shifts in the under- lying data distribution, making the original predictions less accurate. To capture these effects, Perdomo et al. (2020) in- troduced the concept of performative prediction. In this 1INSAIT, Sofia University \u201cSt. Kliment Ohridski\u201d 2Sharif University of Technology.

Recent works have achieved sig- nificant progress in optimizing predictions for perfor- mative accuracy (see Hardt & Mendler-D\u00a8unner, 2023, for a recent survey). While performative risk minimization (PRM) is preferable to standard risk minimization (RM) for the sake of test-time accuracy, the broader impact of PRM remain elusive. In particular, using PRM instead of RM leads to different predictions deployed by the learner and also changes the evolution of the data distribution, and these effects are compounded when deploying mul- tiple models over time. This limited understanding of the impact of PRM on the predictions and distribution may be partially due to the mathematical challenges arizing from analyzing the long-term dynamics of the learned models, in the presense of intricate dependen- cies of the data distribution on all previous models. Contributions In this work, we initiate the analysis of the broader impact of PRM, by studying a sequen- tial performative mean estimation problem for binary variables, in the presence of linear performative dis- tribution shifts. The simplicity of the learning setup enables us to derive the long-term dynamics of PRM, despite the complicated downstream impact of each deployed prediction on the future data distributions. This in turn allows us to quantify the evolution of the predictions and the data distribution. Within this model, we formulate two measures of impact. The first measure concerns the model predic- tions and corresponds to the usual statistical notion of a bias of an estimator. The second measure quantifies the shift in the mean of the binary random variable, relative to the mean in the case of lack of performative effects, and thus allows us to understand the evolution of the data distribution under PRM. We analyze PRM and the two measures in a one- period (single model deployment) and an infinite hori- 1 arXiv:2502.02331v1 [stat.ML] 4 Feb 2025"
