  "title": "On the Diagonals of Rational Functions the Minimal Number of Variables (unabridged Version).pdf",
  "abstract": ". From some observations on the linear di\ufb00erential operators occurring in the Lattice Green function of the d-dimensional face centred and simple cubic lattices, and on the linear di\ufb00erential operators occurring in the n-particle contributions \u03c7(n) to the magnetic susceptibility of the Ising model, we forward some conjectures on the diagonals of rational functions. These conjectures are also in agreement with exact results we obtain for many Calabi-Yau operators, and many other examples related, or not related to physics. Consider a globally bounded power series which is the diagonal of rational functions of a certain number of variables, annihilated by an irreducible minimal order linear di\ufb00erential operator homomorphic to its adjoint. Among the logarithmic formal series solutions, at the origin, of this operator, call n the highest power of the logarithm. We conjecture that this diagonal series can be represented as a diagonal of a rational function with a minimal number of variables Nv related to this highest power n by the relation Nv = n + 2. Since the operator is homomorphic to its adjoint, its di\ufb00erential Galois group is symplectic or orthogonal. We also conjecture that the symplectic or orthogonal character of the di\ufb00erential Galois group is related to the parity of the highest power n, namely symplectic for n odd and orthogonal for n even. We also sketch the case where the denominator of the rational function is not irreducible and is the product of, for instance, two polynomials. We recall that the linear di\ufb00erential operators occurring in the n-particle contributions \u03c7(n) to the magnetic susceptibility of the square Ising model factorize in a large number of direct sums and products of factors. The analysis of the linear di\ufb00erential operators annihilating the diagonal of rational function where the denominator is the product of two polynomials, sheds some light on the emergence of such mixture of direct sums and products of factors. The conjecture Nv = n + 2 still holds for such reducible linear di\ufb00erential operators.
