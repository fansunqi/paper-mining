  "title": "On the Quasi-Uniformity Properties of Quasi-Monte Carlo Lattice Point Sets and Sequences.pdf",
  "abstract": "The discrepancy of a point set quanti\ufb01es how well the points are distributed, with low-discrepancy point sets demonstrating exceptional uniform distribution prop- erties. Such sets are integral to quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which approximate integrals over the unit cube for integrands of bounded variation. In contrast, quasi- uniform point sets are characterized by optimal separation and covering radii, making them well-suited for applications such as radial basis function approximation. This paper explores the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets con- structed from lattices. Speci\ufb01cally, we analyze rank-1 lattice point sets, Fibonacci lattice point sets, Frolov point sets, and (n\u03b1)-sequences, providing insights into their potential for use in applications that require both low-discrepancy and quasi-uniform distribution. As an example, we show that the (n\u03b1)-sequence with \u03b1j = 2j/(d+1) for j \u2208{1, 2, . . . , d} is quasi-uniform and has low-discrepancy.
