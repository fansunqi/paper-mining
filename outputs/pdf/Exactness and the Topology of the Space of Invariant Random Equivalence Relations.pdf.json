  "abstract": ". We characterize exactness of a countable group \u0393 in terms of invariant random equivalence relations (IREs) on \u0393. Speci\ufb01cally, we show that \u0393 is exact if and only if every weak limit of \ufb01nite IREs is an amenable IRE. In particular, for exact groups this implies amenability of the restricted rerooting relation associated to the ideal Bernoulli Voronoi tessellation, the discrete analog of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tesselation.

Introduction Invariant random equivalence relations (IREs) on groups were \ufb01rst introduced by Tucker- Drob [TD13] and later studied by Kechris [Kec17]. Let \u0393 be a countable discrete group and let E \u22822\u0393\u00d7\u0393 denote the standard Borel space of equivalence relations on \u0393. An invariant random equivalence relation (IRE) is a Borel probability measure \u03c1 on E which is invariant under the left shift action \u0393 \u21b7E. A \ufb01nite IRE is an IRE \u03c1 such that \u03c1-almost every equivalence relation has only \ufb01nite classes. 1"
