  "abstract": "Objective: The allostatic load index (ALI) is a composite measure of whole-person health, which reflects the multiple interrelated physiological regulatory systems that underlie healthy functioning. Data from electronic health records (EHR) present a huge opportunity to operationalize the ALI in the learning health system, except they are prone to missingness and errors. Validation of EHR data (e.g., through chart reviews) can provide better-quality data, but realistically, only a subset of patients\u2019 data can be validated, and most protocols do not recover missing data. Methods: Using a representative sample of 1000 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system (100 of whom could be validated), we propose methods to design, conduct, and analyze statistically efficient and robust studies of the ALI and healthcare utilization. With semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation methods, we robustly incorporate all available patient information (validated or unvalidated) into statistical models. Using targeted design strategies, we examine ways to select the most informative patients for validation. Incorporating clinical expertise, we devise a arXiv:2502.05380v1 [stat.ME] 7 Feb 2025"
