  "title": "Characterizing User Behavior the Interplay Between Mobility Patterns and Mobile Traffic.pdf",
  "abstract": "Mobile devices have become essential for capturing human activ- ity, and eXtended Data Records (XDRs) offer rich opportunities for detailed user behavior modeling, which is useful for design- ing personalized digital services. Previous studies have primarily focused on aggregated mobile traffic and mobility analyses, often neglecting individual-level insights. This paper introduces a novel approach that explores the dependency between traffic and mobil- ity behaviors at the user level. By analyzing 13 individual features that encompass traffic patterns and various mobility aspects, we enhance the understanding of how these behaviors interact. Our advanced user modeling framework integrates traffic and mobility behaviors over time, allowing for fine-grained dependencies while maintaining population heterogeneity through user-specific signa- tures. Furthermore, we develop a Markov model that infers traffic behavior from mobility and vice versa, prioritizing significant de- pendencies while addressing privacy concerns. Using a week-long XDR dataset from 1,337,719 users across several provinces in Chile, we validate our approach, demonstrating its robustness and applica- bility in accurately inferring user behavior and matching mobility and traffic profiles across diverse urban contexts.

Keywords Traffic-Mobility Dependency, Individual-Level Analysis, eXtended Data Records (XDRs) 1 Introduction As mobile devices increasingly serve as proxies for human presence and activity, mobile datasets generated by these devices provide a unique opportunity to characterize and model user behavior in un- precedented detail. Among these datasets, eXtended Data Records (XDRs) stand out for their potential to provide the most comprehen- sive coverage of human interactions with mobile networks. XDRs are timestamped and georeferenced records of network mobile data sessions, generated by each mobile device interacting with the op- erator\u2019s network. Unlike traditional datasets such as Call Detail Records (CDRs), which are limited to specific calls and text mes- sages event types, XDRs offer a much broader scope, capturing a wide array of network activities, from app usage to internet traffic. This extensive data richness not only enhances our understand- ing of user interactions with mobile networks but also provides a framework for analyzing underlying mobility patterns. The ability of XDR data to capture both network usage and local- ization context has made it an acknowledged source of information for various studies, including human mobility analysis [8], cellu- lar traffic patterns [15], and network infrastructure usage [17]. By analyzing these mobility patterns\u2014such as the frequency and na- ture of location changes\u2014we can gain valuable insights into user preferences, engagement levels, and behavioral tendencies. Such insights are vital for creating personalized services in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Understanding when and where users are most active can inform adaptive content delivery, personalized recommendations, and targeted advertising strategies, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. This intersection of mobility and mobile traffic is crucial for developing more tailored and responsive user experiences in the digital realm. The interplay between mobile traffic and individual mobility patterns is crucial for understanding how users interact with dig- ital platforms. Several studies have established significant corre- lations between mobile traffic and human mobility, primarily at an aggregate or city-wide scale. For instance, [24] characterized the geographical distribution of cellular traffic, revealing strong spatiotemporal dependencies even among distant cell towers due to transportation patterns across urban environments. Similarly, [25] demonstrated that cellular tower traffic can be indicative of land use, establishing profiles such as residential, transport, office, and entertainment zones based on traffic patterns in metropolitan areas. [4] further highlighted the spatial inhomogeneity of hourly traffic patterns between urban and rural regions, emphasizing how uneven traffic distribution reflects the underlying city infrastructure. While these studies provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic at large scales, fewer have examined traffic and mobility behavior at the individual level. Some works, such as [2] classified network devices into stationary (\u2019cel- los\u2019) and mobile (\u2019flutes\u2019) categories, establishing that more mo- bile devices generate heavier traffic. [19] similarly found that sub- scribers with higher mobility produced more traffic in 3G networks, though their focus remained on network resource usage rather than deeper mobility dynamics. Despite these efforts, the granularity of individual behavior remains underexplored, as the uncovered correlations are not modeled, limiting the ability to reproduce or incorporate them into personalized insights, crucial for improving services like adaptive content delivery and traffic prediction. arXiv:2501.19348v1 [cs.NI] 31 Jan 2025"
