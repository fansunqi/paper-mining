  "abstract": "The paper presents proposals for the application of a tree structure to the documentation of a set of transformations obtained as a result of various registrations of multimodal images obtained in coordinate systems associ- ated with acquisition devices and being registered in one patient-specific coordinate system. A special file format .dpw (digital patient workspace) is introduced. Examples of different registrations yielded from orthodontic analysis and showing main aspects of the usage of tree structure are illus- trated in dpVision software. Keywords: transformation tree, multimodal image registration, dpVision 1. Introduction The advancement of computer systems and tools for the acquisition of multidimensional, multimodal images has led to the growing presence of the concepts of the virtual patient and virtual twin in the literature [Joda and Gallucci (2015); Marradi et al. (2020); Seth et al. (2024)]. Both of these con- cepts are related to the acquisition of digital patient data and matching them in such a way as to obtain the most complete, accurate image of the patient both in terms of his current state and changes over time. The concepts are particularly applicable in in orthodontics and in assisting in the planning of surgical procedures. These concepts consist of the following steps: image \u2217atomaka@iitis.pl Preprint submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine February 3, 2025 arXiv:2501.19140v1 [cs.CV] 31 Jan 2025"
