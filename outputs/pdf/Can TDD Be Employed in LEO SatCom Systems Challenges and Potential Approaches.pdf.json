  "abstract": "\u2014Frequency-division duplexing (FDD) remains the de facto standard in modern low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems, such as SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper. While time-division du- plexing (TDD) is often regarded as superior in today\u2019s terrestrial networks, its viability in future LEO SatCom systems remains unclear. This article details how the long propagation delays and high orbital velocities exhibited by LEO SatCom systems impedes the adoption of TDD, due to challenges involving the frame structure and synchronization. We then present potential approaches to overcome these challenges, which vary in terms of resource efficiency and operational/device complexity and thus would likely be application-specific. We conclude by assessing the performance of these proposed approaches, putting into perspective the tradeoff between complexity and performance gains over FDD. Overall, this article aims to motivate future investigation into the prospects of TDD in LEO SatCom systems and solutions to enable such, with the goal of enhancing future systems and unifying them with terrestrial networks.

INTRODUCTION By the day, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems continue to cement themselves as key components of the 6G landscape, with sights set on provid- ing near-global wireless coverage [1]. Today, LEO SatCom systems such as SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon\u2019s emerging Project Kuiper have become a newfound source of broadband connectivity for millions of un-/under-served users across the globe. These LEO SatCom systems have made tremendous strides toward the dream of ubiquitous connectivity in providing high-speed Internet access to remote areas and supporting emergency SOS and text messaging directly to/from mobile handsets. The continued rollout of LEO SatCom systems continues to accelerate and suggests that their use cases and requirements will diversify greatly over the coming years, with expanded support of Internet-of-things (IoT) services, connected/autonomous vehicles, and national security missions across the globe. It remains an open question how to best optimize and deploy future LEO SatCom systems for these emerging use cases and how such systems may be integrated into the existing terrestrial network paradigm.

In any given wireless communication system, the decision to separate downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) either in time or in frequency may at first glance seem arbitrary, as both divide the time-frequency resource plane in one dimension or the other. As the requirements and techniques of wireless com- munication systems continue to evolve, however, the question of whether to employ frequency-division duplexing (FDD) or time-division duplexing (TDD) has become more nuanced than ever before. Below, we briefly summarize the principal ways in which FDD and TDD are often compared: \u2022 Guard resources: In both FDD and TDD, empty guard resources are required to sufficiently isolate DL and UL signals. In FDD, an empty guard band is often necessary between the DL frequency band and UL frequency band to reduce adjacent channel interference. In TDD, an empty guard period is necessary between a DL time slot and an UL time slot to avoid collisions caused by propagation delays and accommodate the timing advances needed to compensate for said delays. This will be particularly relevant in the context of LEO SatCom, as we will see. \u2022 Resource allocation: In most FDD systems, the DL and UL frequency bands are fixed in both center frequency and bandwidth, often based on a regulated spectrum allocation. As a consequence, the ratio of resources a system allocates to DL and UL is also fixed, constraining its ability to adapt to changes in DL/UL traffic demand. TDD systems, on the other hand, are free to allocate resources dynamically according to DL/UL demand by varying the fraction of time slots given to each. \u2022 CSI acquisition: Obtaining channel state information (CSI) is essential to reliable, high-rate communication, with both FDD and TDD. In FDD, since DL and UL operate within different (potentially quite distant) fre- quency bands, it is necessary to feed back CSI estimates from the receiver to the respective transmitter in each band. TDD famously circumvents the overhead, delay, and quantization associated with this feedback process by exploiting channel reciprocity, i.e., the fact that DL and UL traverse across (approximately) the same channel. \u2022 Hardware: In FDD, since transmission and reception take place simultaneously at a given device, a single antenna with a duplexer or separate antennas for DL and UL is required. In TDD, a single antenna with a switch can be used, since DL and UL share the same frequency band yet occur in different time slots at any given device. arXiv:2502.08179v1 [eess.SP] 12 Feb 2025"
