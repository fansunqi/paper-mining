  "abstract": "Online collaborative learning and working are important for everyone including children. How- ever, children still face a lot of difficulties communicating and working together while online, which keeps them from engaging in long-term project-based teamwork. We aim to investigate online long-term collaborative learning opportunities to address this gap. We design COLP, an online, 16-week, project-based learning program, as an educational intervention based on mul- tiple learning theories for primary school students. We conducted this program with 67 primary school students ages 8-13, across more than five provinces of China. We found that this program could engage more than one-third of children in teamwork after long-term study. Furthermore, we interview children and their parents to help us understand the communication channel, ben- efits, and challenges of this program. Interestingly, we discovered that parents play multiple roles in their children\u2019s collaborative learning, particularly modeling and guiding the children\u2019s collaborative skills. Given the lack of programs designed for children\u2019s long-term online collab- oration, this study may inspire intervention design in computer-supported collaborative learning communities.

Introduction The advent of advanced information and communication technologies has revolutionized the way we work and collaborate. Online platforms and tools have facilitated seamless connectivity and fostered a globalized workforce, transcending geographical barriers. Online work and col- laboration have become the norm in today\u2019s professional landscape. To this end, governments, educators, and entrepreneurs emphasized the need for children to acquire essential 21st-century skills [1] such as digital literacy, communication and collaboration, problem-solving, and cre- ativity, which becomes increasingly crucial to equip them for the complexities of future online collaborative endeavors. Project-based online collaborative learning is characterized by its ability to provide an au- thentic context for children to learn and apply collaborative skills, effectively simulating real- \u2217Corresponding author Preprint submitted to International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction February 6, 2025 arXiv:2502.03226v1 [cs.HC] 5 Feb 2025"
