  "title": "Fostering Data Communities \u2013 Perspective from a Data Archive Service Provider.pdf",
  "abstract": "This paper aims to bridge between the current scientific discourse about the dynamics of data communities in research infrastructures and practical experiences at a data archive which provides services for such data communities. We describe and analyse policies and practices within DANS- KNAW, the Dutch national centre of expertise and repository for research data concerning the interaction with communities in general. We take the case of the emerging DANS Data Station Life Sciences to study how a data archive navigates between observation of data research needs and anticipation of research data archival solutions. This paper offers a unique view of the complex dynamics between data communities (including lay experts) and data service providers. It adds nuances to understanding the emergence of a data community and the role of data service providers, both supporting and shaping, in this process.
