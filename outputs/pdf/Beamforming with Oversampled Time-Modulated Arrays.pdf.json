  "abstract": "\u2014The time-modulated array (TMA) is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected via a multi-throw switch. The switch acts as a modulator switching state faster than the symbol rate. The phase shifting and beamforming is achieved by a cyclic shift of the periodical modulating signal across antennas. In this paper, the TMA mode of operation is proposed to improve the resolution of a conventional phase shifter. The TMAs are analyzed under constrained switching frequency being a small multiple of the symbol rate. The presented generic signal model gives insight into the magnitude, phase and spacing of the harmonic components generated by the quantized modulating sequence. It is shown that the effective phase-shifting resolution can be improved multiplicatively by the oversampling factor (O) at the cost of introducing harmonics. Finally, the array tapering with an oversampled modulating signal is proposed. The oversampling provides O + 1 uniformly distributed tapering amplitudes.

Problem Statement Antenna arrays are becoming a key component of the current and future wireless networks. The high array gain combined with agile beamforming allows to compensate for the high attenuation in millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz bands, opening doors to greater bandwidth [1]. However, the growing number of antenna elements entails a proportional increase in the complexity and number of radio front-end chips. To facilitate the widespread adoption of antenna arrays, more cost- and energy-ef\ufb01cient solutions are needed [2]. The time-modulated array (TMA) is an array architecture in which each antenna is preceded by a multi-throw RF switch that acts as a low-resolution phase shifter. The switch operates at a frequency equal or higher than the symbol rate of the transmitted signal. The simple hardware architecture of the aforementioned building block offers savings in terms of power, cost and size of the radio front-end [3], [4] and allows to leverage the upscaling of the antenna array systems. By adjusting the modulating sequence for each antenna, the TMAs can synthesize and steer the beam pattern [5], [6]. To facilitate more widespread use of the TMA architec- ture, it has to be considered for wideband signals. For large bandwidths, the switching frequency becomes constrained by the hardware giving rise to previously not studied limitations. The constrained switching frequency introduces a trade-off c (t) m = c(t-md ) Tsw y (t)=s(t) m m c (t) TX m=M-1 e j2 f \u03c0 ct m=1 c (t) 1 m=0 c (t) 0 s(t) c (t) M-1 y (t) M-1 y (t) 1 y (t) 0 \u03c6(N-1) \u03c6(1) \u03c6(0) \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 Fig. 1.

The trade-offs and gains need to be addressed in detail to fully quantify the potential of the TMA in practical applications with wideband signals. B. Relevant works The idea of using time modulation for beamforming origi- nated in [7]. In [8], the modulating sequences were optimized to reduce the sidelobes of a \ufb01xed beam. Next, to allow beamforming at the center frequency and improve ef\ufb01ciency, the phase modulated array (PMA) was introduced in [9]. The on-off switches were replaced by switched delay lines. In [10], a TMA architecture with switched IQ modulator per antenna is investigated providing re\ufb01ned control over the phase shift. The analytical formulation for minimizing the undesired harmonics was derived and applied. Simultaneous amplitude and phase weighting is studied in [11] where it is used to reduce the sideband radiation and control the sidelobes of the beam pattern. In [12] the phase modulation of TMA is investigated in detail with theoretical derivations of ef\ufb01ciency depending on the number of phase shift values. The peak- to-harmonic power ratio and sidelobe levels are studied as a function of the number of quantization steps. In [13], a TMA constructed of a cascade of two 1-bit phase shifters is considered, which are controlled by two asynchronous signals. Instead of changing the pulse width of the two signals, the"
