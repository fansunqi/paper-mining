  "abstract": "Existing methods of haptic feedback for virtual fluids are challeng- ing to scale, lack durability for long-term rough use, and fail to fully capture the expressive haptic qualities of fluids. To overcome these limitations, we present Vibr-eau, a physical system designed to emulate the sensation of virtual fluids in vessels using vibro- tactile actuators. Vibr-eau uses spatial and temporal vibrotactile feedback to create realistic haptic sensations within a 3D-printed vessel. When the users are in the virtual environment and inter- act with the physical vessel, vibration impulses are triggered and the user will feel like there is fluid in the vessel. We explore the impact of motor density, direct touch, and vibration strength on users\u2019 perception of virtual fluid sensations. User studies reveal that Vibr-eau effectively simulates dynamic weight shifts and fluid-like sensations, with participants reporting experiences closely resem- bling real-world interactions with fluids. Our findings contribute to the development of adaptable and scalable haptic applications for virtual fluids, providing insights into optimizing parameters for realistic and perceptually faithful simulated fluid experiences in VR environments.

KEYWORDS HCI, haptics, vibrotactile, virtual reality 1 INTRODUCTION Human-computer interaction (HCI) research in the realm of virtual environments has made significant strides in simulating realistic sensations to enhance user experiences. One of the challenges re- volves around the faithful reproduction of fluid sensations in virtual environments. SWISH [30] and Geppetteau [31] offer two different approaches of dynamically shifting weight to render haptic sensa- tion of virtual fluids behavior. However, actively moving systems are more susceptible to failure with frequent use, making them less reliable in demanding environments. In dynamic settings like schools, for example a highschool chemistry class, where equipment is subject to constant handling and rough use, durability becomes critical for ensuring long-term functionality and minimizing main- tenance.

Harnessing vibrotactile actuators to emulate the sensation of virtual fluids enhances the viability of haptic systems for real train- ing/classroom use and opens new avenues for exploration. Vibro- tactile actuators, known for their accessibility, small form factor, and durability, have been instrumental in simulating various haptic illusions, such as bending, stretching of rigid objects [15], stiffness [1, 42], forces [21, 45], and textures [36]. Research work have also shown asymmetric vibrations to provide the sensation of direction [4, 11, 28], and pseudoforces [8, 10] typically implemented using voice coil actuators. There is an emphasis on the importance of lightweight form factors [26] and simplicity [24] for haptic devices, highlighting their significance for user comfort and long-term us- age. Prior research work have explored creating virtual fluid appli- cations; however, they fall short in the haptic rendering of virtual fluids. DualVib [40] was able to use vibrations to simulate the sensa- tion of dynamic mass for solid virtual objects such as coins in a jar. However, the user study results indicated that DualVib did not work out for fluids. This may be a result of the one-axis pseudo-force feedback not being able to capture the full expressiveness of fluid. Another work used multi-actuator vibrotactile feedback [5] to sim- ulate a wine in a bottle. The authors simulated fluid inside a virtual object using an underdamped spring attached to a virtual mass at the object\u2019s center, causing lag and oscillation during movement pauses. The vibration amplitude on each actuator was inversely proportional to the distance from the mass, creating a tactile sensa- tion of motion between two actuator locations. However, this 1D approach fails to capture the complex behaviors of real liquids. arXiv:2501.18755v1 [cs.HC] 30 Jan 2025"
