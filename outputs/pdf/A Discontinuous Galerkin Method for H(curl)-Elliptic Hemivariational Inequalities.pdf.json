  "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving H (curl)-elliptic hemivariational inequalities. By selecting an appropriate numerical flux, we construct an Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) scheme. A comprehensive numerical analysis of the IPDG method is conducted, addressing key aspects such as consistency, boundedness, stability, and the existence, uniqueness, uniform boundedness of the numerical solutions. Building on these properties, we establish a priori error estimates, demonstrating the optimal convergence order of the numerical solutions under suitable solution regularity assumptions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretically predicted convergence order and to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Introduction To describe the mixed state of high-temperature superconductors, C. P. Bean proposed the critical state theory of high-temperature superconductors [5, 6]. The basic idea of this model can be described as follows.
