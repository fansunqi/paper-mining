  "abstract": "\u2014The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by User Equipment (UE) through the implemen- tation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. The proposed method consists of two primary steps for predicting the moving port of the FA: the first involves utilizing the channel tables that encompass historical channel state information from all movable ports of the FA to forecast the channel tables for subsequent time periods; the second step entails selecting the port of the FA for the forthcoming time based on the predicted channel tables and the known reference channels that require alignment. To enhance the learning capabilities of the LLM model in the context of FA port prediction, we incorporate the Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Furthermore, during the model training phase, we implement the warm- up-aided cosine learning rate (LR) technique to augment the accuracy of the predictions. The simulation results show that our model exhibits strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium- to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing FA port calculation methods, the performance of the port predicted by our model demonstrates superior efficacy. Additionally, our model exhibits lower prediction costs and faster prediction and reasoning speeds.

INTRODUCTION In recent decades, the implementation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology has significantly en- hanced the capacity and reliability of communication sys- tems. Nevertheless, the fixed deployment of current antennas limits the utilization of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), particularly in environments with little scattering. Addition- ally, the constraints imposed by the antenna spacing, i.e., Yali Zhang, Haifan Yin and Weidong Li are with School of Electronic Infor- mation and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technol- ogy, 430074 Wuhan, China (email: yalizhang@hust.edu.cn; yin@hust.edu.cn; weidongli@hust.edu.cn).

This limitation is particularly pronounced on the UE side, where the spatial dimensions are typically small, resulting in inadequate exploitation of narrow space diversity [1]\u2013[3]. In contrast, a novel antenna technology known as the fluid antenna (FA) or movable antenna, depending on the hardware implementation, offers the capability to switch among various positions, referred to as \u201cports\u201d, within a specified area. In this paper, the terms \u201cFluid antenna\u201d and \u201cMovable antenna\u201d are considered interchangeable. In the subsequent discussion, we will employ the term \u201cFluid antenna\u201d to encompass both concepts. The position and configuration of the FA can be dynamically adjusted, allowing for greater adaptability [4], [5]. Despite the limited size of the movable area of the FA, the potential for numerous movable ports allows for significant diversity gain across a multitude of spatially dependent ports. Furthermore, the continuous mobility of the FA within a specified area facilitates the optimal exploitation of spatial DoF, thereby enhancing the conditions of the wireless channel. The fluid antenna system (FAS) presents significant advan- tages and potential applications [6]. Notably, the integration of FAS with MIMO technology, referred to as MIMO-FAS, has the capacity to enhance the performance of a MIMO system by selecting ports that enhance the beamforming gain or improve the MIMO rank conditions, thereby facilitating exceptionally high data transmission rates and enhanced re- liability. In multi-user scenarios, FAS can be employed for interference suppression purposes, allowing users to leverage naturally occurring interference nulls in the propagation en- vironment by adjusting the FA port, which reduces the need for interference-suppression precoding at the BS. Furthermore, FAS can be integrated with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology, thereby circumventing the need for intricate optimization processes associated with RIS [7], [8]. FAS also encounters numerous challenges [6], one of which pertains to the selection of ports. The advantages of FAS com- pared to conventional fixed-location antenna systems (FPAs) are primarily due to its flexible antenna positioning capabil- ities. Nevertheless, identifying the appropriate port for the FA to achieve superior communication performance presents a significant challenge, as the channel response exhibits a significant degree of nonlinearity as a function of the spatial positioning of the FA. Conventional optimization techniques for FAS port selection encompass the gradient descent [9] method, successive convex approximation (SCA) [10], alter- nating optimization (AO) method, exhaustive search method, arXiv:2502.09857v1 [eess.SP] 14 Feb 2025"
