  "abstract": "Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower \u03b1 and charge carrier concentration n beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, \u03b1 = \u00b1 kB e (b\u2212 ln\u03c3), valid for materials with \u03b1 > 90\u00b5VK\u22121 when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature. Thermoelectric materials are able to directly interconvert heat en- ergy and electrical power, making them of particular interest for applications in solid-state cooling and power generation.1,2 Ther- moelectric materials research typically aims to identify or develop materials with the best possible thermoelectric efficiency, defined by the figure of merit zT = \u03b12\u03c3T/(\u03bael +\u03balat), where \u03b1, \u03c3, T and \u03bael with \u03balat represent the thermopower, electrical conductivity, temperature, electronic and lattice (phonon) thermal conductiv- ities, respectively. Improving zT is a non-trivial task due to the interrelationship among \u03b1, \u03c3, \u03balat, and \u03bael, mainly correlated through the charge carrier concentration n (chemical potential \u00b5) and the scattering mechanisms involved.3 Therefore, understand- ing charge carrier transport properties is essential for engineering thermoelectric materials and enhancing their performance. Ther- mopower \u03b1, in turn, is a fundamental material parameter particu- larly helpful to understanding and optimizing thermoelectric ma- terials. \u03b1 depends on the band structure, charge carrier transport entropy, scattering mechanism, and the doping level of the mate- rial, leading its quantity to be a collection of many characteristics, including band degeneracy, effective mass, scattering factor, and chemical potential.4 The effective mass model is often used to analyze experimen- tally measured thermopower. For many semiconductors, charge carrier transport can be adequately described by considering the states near the band edge.5\u20137 When parabolic dispersion is as- sumed, the thermopower can be considered as the measure of the chemical potential \u00b5 (refer to the Supporting Information file for details).8 Experimental thermopower measurements, in turn, are relatively straightforward to perform and highly widespread, particularly in laboratories focused on thermoelectric materials research. A common approach is to fit the experimental data to the form expected for a semiconductor with a single parabolic band, where charge transport is dominated by a single scattering mechanism (e.g., acoustic phonon scattering), and the effective mass m\u2217 d independent of doping level and temperature. However, many materials deviate from this idealized scenario,9 exhibiting aResearch Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0044, Japan. bGraduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tenn- odai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan. \u2217E-mail: MORI.Takao@nims.go.jp. \u2020Electronic supplementary information available. multi-valley band structures,10,11 non-parabolic bands,12 com- plex scattering mechanisms,13 or disorder that affects the carrier transport.14,15 Nevertheless, even in such cases lying beyond the single parabolic band approximation, the effective mass model re- mains one of the most simple yet useful tools for transport proper- ties analysis, guiding rational design toward better thermoelectric performance.16,17 Within the effective mass model, where carrier transport is dominated by majority carriers and described by a single parabolic band with a single scattering mechanism, the carrier relaxation time \u03c4 can be expressed by a simple power-law \u03c4(\u03b5) = \u03c40\u03b5r with r representing the scattering factor. Consequently, the thermopower at any temperature or doping level can be described as a function of only chemical potential:5,7 \u03b1 (\u03b7) = \u00b1kB e \u0000r + 5/2 \u0001 Fr+3/2 (\u03b7) \u0000r + 3/2 \u0001 Fr+1/2 (\u03b7) \u2212\u03b7 ! , (1) where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, and Fj (\u03b7) is the j-th order Fermi integrals defined as Fj (\u03b7) = Z \u221e 0 \u03b5 j 1+e\u03b5\u2212\u03b7 d\u03b5, (2) with \u03b5 = E/kBT representing the reduced carrier energy, and \u03b7 = \u00b5/kBT representing the reduced chemical potential. The charge carrier concentration in this context is given by n(\u03b7) = 4\u03c0 2m\u2217 dkBT h2 !3/2 F1/2 (\u03b7), (3) where m\u2217 d is the density-of-state effective mass, h is the Planck constant. Therefore, the effective mass m\u2217 d value can be esti- mated from experimental values of thermopower \u03b1 and carrier concentration n. For practical purposes, however, it is conve- nient to use analytical expressions that directly connect \u03b1 and n, avoiding numerical integration of the Fermi integrals (Eq. 2). For the two limiting cases of a degenerate (\u03b7 \u22655) and a non- degenerate (\u03b7 \u2264\u22121) semiconductors, the Fermi integrals can be solved analytically, providing relatively simple expressions for the transport coefficients (for details, refer to Supporting Informa- tion; Figure S1). Note that the band edge (\u03b7 = 0) is used as the reference point for the chemical potential.5,6 1\u20136 | 1 arXiv:2502.03837v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 7 Feb 2025"
