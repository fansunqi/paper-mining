  "abstract": ". Polynomial identities of two-dimensional Novikov algebras are studied over the complex \ufb01eld C. We determine minimal generating sets for the T-ideals of the polynomial identities and linear bases for the corresponding relatively free algebras. As a consequence, we establish that polynomial identities separate two-dimensional Novikov algebras, which are not associative. Namely, any two-dimensional Novikov algebras, which are not associative, are isomorphic if and only if they satisfy the same polynomial identities. Moreover, we obtain the codimension sequences of all these algebras. In particular, every two-dimensional Novikov algebra has at most linear growth of its codimension sequence. We explicitly describe multilinear images of every two-dimensional Novikov algebra. In particular, we show that these images are vector spaces.

Throughout the paper, by an algebra we mean an F-vector space endowed with a bilinear product, where the \ufb01eld F has an arbitrary characteristic p \u2a7e0. An algebra N is called a Novikov algebra if N satis\ufb01es the following polynomial identities (x, y, z) = (y, x, z) (the identity of left symmetry for associators), (1) (xy)z = (xz)y (the identity of right commutativity), (2) where (x, y, z) = (xy)z \u2212x(yz) stands for the associator in variables x, y, z. Novikov algebras were independently introduced in the study of Hamiltonian operators in the formal calculus of variations by Gel\u2019fand and Dorfman [20] as well as in the connection with linear Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type by Balinskii and Novikov [5]. Novikov algebras are tightly connected with Lie algebras. Namely, for an algebra A denote by A(\u2212) the vector space A endowed with a new product [\u2212, \u2212] de\ufb01ned by [x, y] := xy \u2212yx for all x, y \u2208A. An algebra A is called a Lie-admissible algebra if A(\u2212) is a Lie algebra. In this case, we call A(\u2212) the associated Lie algebra of A. Every algebra satisfying polynomial identity (1) (and hence every Novikov algebra) is Lie-admissible. Zelmanov [35] proved that every simple \ufb01nite-dimensional Novikov algebra over an alge- braically closed \ufb01eld of characteristic zero is one-dimensional. Filippov [19] constructed \ufb01rst examples of simple in\ufb01nite-dimensional Novikov algebras over \ufb01elds of characteristic p \u2a7e0 and simple \ufb01nite-dimensional Novikov algebras over \ufb01elds of characteristic p > 0. Xu [33] gave a complete classi\ufb01cation of \ufb01nite-dimensional simple Novikov algebras over an algebraically closed \ufb01eld of characteristic p > 2. Xu [34] also established a classi\ufb01cation of simple in\ufb01nite-dimensional Novikov algebras over an algebraically closed \ufb01eld of characteristic zero. Bai and Meng [4] classi\ufb01ed all Novikov algebras of dimension two and three over C. There ex- ists, up to isomorphism, seven two-dimensional Novikov algebras with nontrivial multiplication 1"
