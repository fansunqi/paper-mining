Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for A = rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by A = Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu2+ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements. Antiferromagnetic kagome layers, are prime candi- dates to search for an experimental realization of the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase [1, 2], characterized by the absence of static magnetic order down to low- est temperatures with macroscopic entanglement and fractional excitations. Cu-based systems with kagome layers of Cu2+ spin S = 1/2 cations are considered ideal QSL candidates, with one of the first experimen- tal QSL phases observed in herbertsmithite with compo- sition ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 [3, 4]. Recently, the disordered case of a Dirac spin liquid (SL) [5, 6] is found within a related new family of compounds with composition An+Cu3(OH)6Xn wherein X can be F, Cl, Br, NO3, SO4 and A both a divalent or trivalent cation as summa- rized in Ref. [7]. The majority of these systems crystal- lize with kapellasite-related structures, a structural poly- morph of the herbertsmithite structure with AA-stacked perfect kagome planes [8] (see Figure 1). For trivalent cations A3+, e.g. A = Nd - Dy, Y, an additional halo- gen atom is included, resulting in compounds with com- position A3+Cu3(OH)6Cl3 crystallizing with a trigonal crystal structure (space group P3m1, no. 164) [7]. For A = Nd, Sm canted antiferromagnetic order of the Cu magnetic moments has been found at around 20 K and 18 K [9]. Polarization of the rare-earth moments is indicated by a second anomaly in the magnetic suscepti- bility at 8 K and 6 K. For A = Eu, we have reported two magnetic transitions at TN = 14.7 K and TN = 8.7 K, where the magnetism shows enhanced anisotropy and in- creased effective magnetic moments of \u00b5\u22a5 eff = 2.5\u00b5B and \u00b5\u2225 eff = 3.25\u00b5B at 350 K. [7] The enhancement over the Cu2+ spin-only effective moment of 1.73 \u00b5B can be ascribed to polarization from the Van Vleck excited mo- ment of Eu3+ cations. Also for A = Eu a magnetic long-range order (LRO) transition occurs with a sharp \u2217puphal@fkf.mpg.de magnon peak appearing in the Eg magnetic Raman con- tinuum below the magnetic transition temperature of TN = 17 K [10]. For A = Gd, Tb, Dy similar magnetic transitions are observed at TN = 17 K, 16 K, and 17 K, respectively [11]. All these compounds show a similar ad- ditional magnetic transition from the polarization of the rare-earth ion. Gd, Tb, and Dy show additional peaks in the heat capacity at 4.5 K, 7.5 K, and at 6 K, respectively [11]. For A = Y, a magnetic transition at TN = 15 K was detected by neutron diffraction [12] with clear magnetic Bragg reflections, but the Cu ordered magnetic moments are suppressed to 0.42(2)\u00b5B. LRO for A = Y is further- more supported by static moments seen in \u00b5SR experi- ments [13, 14]. The q = 0 magnetic structure is similar to those of the Cd- and the Ca-Kapellasite systems [15, 16]. These two phases represent two examples of kapellasite family members with A being a divalent ion, where the magnetic order at 4 K and 7.2 K, respectively is ascribed to strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. [12\u2013 14, 17] Hence, these P3m1 structural variants constitute a family of the kapellasite-type compounds, where in all cases magnetic field induced DM interaction causes or- dering of the Cu ions with a transition for the rare-earth moments at around half TN, depending on by the para- magnetic rare-earth moments. Interestingly, for the nonmagnetic cation A = Y the compound is not stable against water, leading to Cl - OH substitution. As a result phases with composition YCu3(OH)6+xCl3\u2212x are formed, until the end-member Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8 for x = 1/3 is reached, which crystal- lizes with a trigonal structure (space group R3, no. 148) [18, 19]. This substitutional variant shows a distortion of the Cu lattice. The Y atoms move out of the kagome plane, being pulled away by the shorter (OH)\u22121 bond, thus generating two non-equivalent Cu sites and a unique magnetic lattice with three different nearest-neighbor ex- change interactions is required [18, 20] to describe the ex- perimental data. Similarly, Cd- and Ca-kapellasite have a H2O molecule occupying the same interplane site [15, 16] arXiv:2502.11841v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 17 Feb 2025"
