  "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is a critical chanllenge for incremental object detection (IOD). Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically, rely- ing on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing component-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a key insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predomi- nantly localized to the RoI Head classifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This finding challenges conventional as- sumptions, motivating us to develop a framework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Re- play (RePRE) mitigates classifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse pro- totypes represent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained prototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Pro- jection (NSGP) is further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating the feature extractor in directions orthogonal to sub- space of old inputs via gradient projection, align- ing RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our simple yet effective design allows NSGP- RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings. Our work not only advances IOD methodology but also provide pivotal insights for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in IOD. Code will be available soon. 1. Introduction As one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision, significant progress has been made in the field of object detection (Ren et al., 2016; Khanam & Hussain, 2024; Li et al., 2023). Traditional methods mostly solve the object detection task under a static closed-world setting, where 1School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical Un- viersity, Xi\u2019an, China 2School of Telecommunication and Engineer- ing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China 3Huawei Technologies Ltd. Correspondence to: Shizhou Zhang <szzhang@nwpu.edu.cn>. all to-be-detected object classes and annotations are fully available before training. Nevertheless, real-world applica- tions frequently encompass dynamic environments where new object categories appear progressively over time. De- tectors should possess the capability to adjust to novel tasks through sequential learning, while simultaneously preserv- ing the knowledge gained from detecting previous classes. Conventional object detectors (Ren et al., 2016; Carion et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) often suffer from catastrophic forget- ting during incremental learning, which significantly ham- pers their performance in previously learned classes when new tasks are introduced. Unlike incremental learning in classification tasks, incremental object detection (IOD) is more challenging than classification as it requires the si- multaneous classification and location of a set of objects in the image. To obtain an incremental object detector with excellent performance, many research efforts have been de- voted by introducing knowledge distillation or data replay techniques (Cermelli et al., 2022; Yuyang et al., 2023; Mo et al., 2024) into popular detection frameworks. Current research in the IOD field usually treats the detector as a whole, and few works pay attention to whether catas- trophic forgetting mainly comes from a certain component or whether all modules contribute roughly the same. Demys- tifying catastrophic forgetting in a sophisticated detector is necessary and helpful not only to establish a bridge between incremental learning in classification and object detection, but also to provide principled guidance for designing sim- pler and more effective IOD methods. In this study, we chose the widely adopted two-stage Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2016) detector as a pioneering research object. Faster R-CNN is composed of a backbone, neck, region pro- posal network (RPN) and region of interest head (RoI Head), each of which is crucial to the detector\u2019s performance. Our primary focus is on the RPN and RoI Head, known for their key roles in object detection. Through a systematic analy- sis of its core components, we uncover several important insights. 1) RPN\u2019s recall ability remains consistent when transitioning to new tasks. 2) RPN\u2019s forgetting has an in- significant impact on overall performance. 3) Forgetting mainly occurs in the RoI Head\u2019s classifier, while the re- gressor component efficiently retains its knowledge. These findings challenge conventional assumptions and inspire us 1 arXiv:2502.05540v1 [cs.CV] 8 Feb 2025"
