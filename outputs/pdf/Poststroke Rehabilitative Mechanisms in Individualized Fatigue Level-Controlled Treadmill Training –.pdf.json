  "abstract": "Individualized training improved post-stroke motor function rehabilitation efficiency. However, there remains limited clarity regarding the mechanisms of how individualized training facilitates recovery. This study aims to explore the cortical and corticomuscular rehabilitative effects in post-stroke motor function recovery during individualized training. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were randomly distributed into two groups: forced training (FOR-T, n=13) and individualized fatigue- controlled training (FAT-C, n=13) to receive training respectively from day 2 to day 14 post-stroke. Behavior score was evaluated through modified neurological severity score (mNSS), peripheral fatigue was evaluated by electromyography (EMG) mean power frequency (MPF), central fatigue was evaluated through plasma (tryptophan and tyrosine ratio, Trp/Tyr) and electroencephalograph (EEG) Lempel-ziv complexity (LZC), the rehabilitative effects in inter-hemisphere balance and corticomuscular pathways were evaluated by EEG power spectral density (PSD) slope and directed corticmuscular coherence (dCMC) respectively. The FAT-C group exhibited superior motor function recovery (2-way ANOVA, timepoint: P = 0.000, EF = 0.614, group: P = 0.000, EF = 0.232) and less central fatigue (Trp/Tyr, Paired t test, FOR-T: P = 0.0184, FAT-C: P = 0.1028) compared to the FOR-T group. EEG PSD slope analysis demonstrated a better inter- hemispheric balance in FAT-C group compare to the FOR-T group. The dCMC analysis indicated that training-induced fatigue led to a short-term down-regulation of descending"
