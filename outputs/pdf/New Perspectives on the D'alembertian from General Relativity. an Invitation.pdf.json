  "title": "New Perspectives on the D'alembertian from General Relativity. an Invitation.pdf",
  "abstract": ". This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d\u2019Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear p-version thereof, where p is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent com- parison estimates for the p-d\u2019Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (no- tably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these p-d\u2019Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented. Contents 1.

Financial support by the EPFL through a Bernoulli Instructorship is gratefully acknowledged. This is an invited review for the conference \u201cMetric measure spaces, Ricci curvature, and optimal transport\u201d at Villa Monastero, Varenna, operated from September 23, 2024 to October 1, 2024. I sincerely thank Fabio Cavalletti, Matthias Erbar, Jan Maas, and Karl-Theodor Sturm for their organization of this stimulating event and the great opportunity to compose this survey. I thank Tobias Beran, Matteo Calisti, Nicola Gigli, Robert McCann, Argam Ohanyan, Felix Rott, and Clemens S\u00e4mann for the fruitful joint work on [23] and helpful comments. A substantial part of the surveyed works [23, 36] was conducted during my Postdoctoral Fellowships at the Univer- sity of Toronto and my Fields Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences from 2022 to 2024. I sincerely thank these institutions and particularly my mentor Robert McCann for their generous support and the inspirational research conditions which made these excellent works possible. I also thank Nicola Gigli for his numerous comments which made me learn new facets even in my hobbyhorse of metric geometry. This overview was completed during the HIM Trimester Program \u201cMetric Analysis\u201d at the Hausdor\ufb00Research In- stitute for Mathematics, Bonn. I sincerely thank the institute for creating such a stimulating research atmosphere."
