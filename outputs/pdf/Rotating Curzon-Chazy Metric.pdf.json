  "abstract": "We demonstrate that the Curzon metric for a positive mass configuration possesses a singular event horizon with in- finite area. This singularity has significant implications, revealing that the three-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces, which are orthogonal to the Killing vector field, exhibit a multiply connected structure. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a test particle orbiting a central \u03b3-object within this spacetime. It is found that under certain condi- tions, the particle\u2019s velocity can approach the speed of light, leading to an exceptionally high total energy at a specific value of the deformation parameter governing the spacetime structure. Moreover, we uncover a causality issue for a critical value of the deformation parameter, where the test particle can exceed the speed of light, potentially offering new insights into the theoretical existence of tachyons. This study contributes to the understanding of relativistic ob- jects in deformed spacetimes and suggests that such violations of causality could play a role in explaining the elusive nature of tachyonic phenomena in high-energy physics.

Introduction In general relativity, the Kerr metric represents one of the most important exact solutions of Einstein\u2019s field equa- tions, describing the geometry of spacetime around a rotating, uncharged black hole. Unlike the Schwarzschild metric, which models a non-rotating black hole with a spherically symmetric event horizon, the Kerr solution incorporates rotation, leading to a richer and more complex structure characterized by an ergosphere, frame-dragging effects, and the possibility of energy extraction via the Penrose process. The difficulty of obtaining exact analytical solutions for rotating compact objects stems from the nonlinear nature of Einstein\u2019s field equations. In many alternative theories of gravity, including modified gravity models and higher-dimensional theories, the inclusion of rotation often neces- sitates additional assumptions or approximations due to the increased complexity of the governing equations. Despite these challenges, the Kerr metric remains a fundamental solution in general relativity and serves as a foundation for exploring more general rotating solutions in modified theories. Extensions of the Kerr solution, such as those in- corporating electric charge Kerr-Newman metric, higher dimensions Myers-Perry solution [1], or deviations due to modified gravity, are of great interest in theoretical physics and astrophysics. Studying these metrics provides insights into the nature of astrophysical black holes, the behavior of accretion disks, and the potential observational signatures of deviations from Einstein\u2019s theory. The Curzon\u2013Chazy spacetime, originally formulated as an exact solution to Einstein\u2019s field equations, continues to be an intriguing subject of study, particularly in the context of alternative theories of gravity and its extensions. The introduction of a phantom scalar field counterpart to the Curzon\u2013Chazy metric, as discussed in [2], further enriches the landscape of solutions by incorporating exotic matter fields, which may have implications for violations of the energy \u2217Corresponding author Email addresses: bturimov@astrin.uz (Bobur Turimov), odilbekhamroev@gmail.com (Odil Yunusov), shavkat.qarshiboyev.89@bk.ru (Shavkat Karshiboev), ahmadjon@astrin.uz (Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov) Preprint submitted to Journal Name February 18, 2025 arXiv:2502.11214v1 [gr-qc] 16 Feb 2025"
