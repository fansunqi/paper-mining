  "abstract": ". We consider a matrix semigroup T : [0, \u221e) \u2192Rd\u00d7d without as- suming any measurability properties and show that, if T is bounded close to 0 and T(t) \u22650 entrywise for all t, then T is continuous. This complements classical results for the scalar-valued case. We also prove an analogous result if T takes values in the positive operators over a sequence space. 1. Introduction Motivation. It is a classical theme of ideas that a function T : [0, \u221e) \u2192R that satis\ufb01es the functional equation T (0) = 1, T (t + s) = T (t)T (s) for all s, t \u2208[0, \u221e) (1.1) is, under mild conditions, given by T (t) = eta for a number a \u2208R and all t \u2208[0, \u221e). For instance, this is true if T is continuous at 0. Alternatively, it su\ufb03ces to assume that T is measurable and is not constantly zero on (0, \u221e). We refer to [6, Sections I.1 and VII.2] for a more thorough discussion of this theme of ideas. In a similar vein, the following result holds, where measurability is replaced with a boundedness assumption close to 0. Proposition 1.1 (Continuity of scalar semigroups). Let T : [0, \u221e) \u2192R satisfy the functional equation (1.1) and assume that T (t) \u0338= 0 for at least one t \u2208(0, \u221e). If supt\u2208[0,1] |T (t)| < \u221e, then T is continuous (and hence T (t) = eta for a number a \u2208R and all t \u2208[0, \u221e)). This observation motivates the theorems in the following sections, and we also use it in an argument below. In order to be more self-contained, we thus include a proof of the continuity of T in Proposition 1.1 at the end of the introduction. Note that Proposition 1.1 does not remain true if T maps to C instead of R, see the simple Example 1.2 below. By identifying each complex number with an orthogonal matrix in R2\u00d72 we can thus see that the proposition does not hold for matrix-valued functions T , either. In this note we show that the proposition remains valid, though, if T is matrix- valued and satis\ufb01es T (t) \u22650 entrywise for each t \u2208[0, \u221e) (Theorem 2.1). More generally, a similar result remains true if each T (t) is a positive linear operator on a sequence space (Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2). Matrix and operator semigroups. We use the following notation. For a Banach space E, let L(E) denote the space of bounded linear operators on E. If E = Rn, we identify L(E) with the matrix space Rn\u00d7n in the usual way.
