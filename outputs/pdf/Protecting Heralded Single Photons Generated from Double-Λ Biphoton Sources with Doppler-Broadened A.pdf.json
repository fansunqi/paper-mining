The heralded single photons produced by biphoton sources using the double-\u039b spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process o\ufb00er advantages of narrow linewidth, stable frequency, and tunable linewidth\u2014qualities not found in other types of biphoton sources. In this study, we investigated a hot-atom SFWM double-\u039b biphoton source. We discovered that, under the condition counterintuitive to the present theory, heralded single photons of the source enhanced their generation rate by a factor of 3.6, heralding probability by a factor of 3.0, temporal width by 2.1, and spectral brightness by a factor of 10. These unexpected \ufb01ndings led us to propose a new theoretical framework for a previously unexplored physical mechanism. Our proposed theory e\ufb00ectively explains the observed results. Traditionally, similar spectral brightness (SB) from atom-based sources resulted in a lower signal- to-background ratio (SBR) than crystal- or chip-based biphoton sources, mainly due to poorer heralding probabilities. In our work, we experimentally demonstrated that the SBR improved by a factor of 4.8 while maintaining a comparable SB. As a result, the SBR performance of the atom-based biphoton source is now on par with that of crystal- or chip-based sources. This research introduces a new tuning parameter for double-\u039b SFWM biphoton sources, enhances our understanding of biphoton generation, and opens new avenues for improving the performance of these sources. Biphotons are pairs of single photons. One can uti- lize one photon of a pair to herald the arrival of an- other in a quantum operation, so the former and lat- ter are called the heralding and heralded single pho- tons. Heralded single photons are practical and versatile qubits in long-distance quantum communication and op- tical quantum computation. The biphoton source based on the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process with the double-\u039b transition scheme has the merits of narrow linewidth or long temporal width, high spectral brightness, stable frequency, and large linewidth tunabil- ity [1, 2]. The state-of-art double-\u039b biphoton sources with room-temperature or hot atoms have achieved a linewidth of 290 kHz (or 50 kHz with laser-cooled atoms) in Ref. [3] (or Ref. [4]), a generation rate of 6.4\u00d7105/s in this work, and a spectral brightness of 3.8\u00d7105/s/MHz at a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 2.7 in Ref. [5] or 3.6\u00d7105/s/MHz at a higher SBR of 6.8 in this work. As shown in Fig. 1, the double-\u039b scheme of the SFWM biphoton source consists of two Raman processes. The pump \ufb01eld and signal photons form the \ufb01rst Raman tran- sition induced by the vacuum \ufb02uctuation, where popu- lation absorbs a pump photon, emits a signal photon, and moves from ground states |1\u27e9to |2\u27e9. This generated signal photon moves out of the medium and typically becomes the heralding photon, and the Raman process establishes a ground-state coherence. The coupling \ufb01eld utilizes the ground-state coherence to induce the second \u2217The two authors contributed equally. \u2020Electronic address: yu@phys.nthu.edu.tw Raman transition, where the population in |2\u27e9absorbs a coupling photon, emits a probe photon, and moves back to |1\u27e9. This generated probe photon is typically the heralded photon. Each Ramann process maintains the two-photon resonance with the uncertainty due to the transition bandwidth. The two-photon resonance en- sures the probe frequency follows the coupling frequency with the \ufb01xed o\ufb00set of the frequency di\ufb00erence between |1\u27e9and |2\u27e9. Therefore, one can vary the frequency of the coupling laser \ufb01eld to tune that of the heralded probe photons. Previously in literature [3\u201335], all of the double-\u039b SFWM biphoton sources employed resonant or near- resonant coupling laser \ufb01elds to produce resonant or near- resonant probe single photons. The coupling-probe Ra- man transition with a nearly zero one-photon detuning exhibits the e\ufb00ect of electromagnetically induced trans- parency (EIT) or slow light, which prolongs the propaga- tion delay time of probe photons and produces narrow- linewidth biphotons. A resonant probe \ufb01eld can experi- ence the largest optical depth of a medium and possess the greatest propagation delay time due to the EIT e\ufb00ect. Furthermore, a resonant coupling \ufb01eld can enhance the nonlinear e\ufb03ciency of the four-wave mixing process, and a larger coupling detuning results in a worse e\ufb03ciency. More importantly, the previous theory of the double-\u039b SFWM biphoton generation reveals that the biphoton generation rate decreases with the coupling \ufb01eld detuning [1, 2]. Hence, in the double-\u039b SFWM biphoton source, using a far-detuned coupling \ufb01eld to generate far-detuned probe photons was considered counterintuitive. Here, we discovered that the coupling \ufb01eld with a de- tuning, \u2206c, far larger than the transition linewidth of a arXiv:2502.06344v1 [quant-ph] 10 Feb 2025"
