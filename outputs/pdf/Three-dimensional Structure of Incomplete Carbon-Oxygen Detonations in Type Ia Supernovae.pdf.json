  "abstract": "Carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation with reactions terminating either after burning of C12 in the leading C12 +C12 reaction or after burning of C12 and O16 to Si-group elements may occur in the low-density outer layers of exploding white dwarfs and be responsible for the production of intermediate-mass elements observed in the outer layers of Type Ia supernovae. Basic one-dimensional properties of CO-detonations have been summarized in our previous work. This paper presents the results of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of low-density CO-detonations and discusses their multidimensional stability, cellular structure, and propagation through a constant low-density background. We find three-dimensional CO detonations to be strikingly different from their one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional detonations are significantly more robust and capable of propagating without decay compared to highly unstable and marginal one- and two- dimensional detonations. The detonation cell size and whether burning of C12 in a three-dimensional detonation wave is followed by the subsequent O16 burning is sensitive to both the background density and the initial C12 to O16 mass ratio. We also discuss the possible implications for understanding the observed early time bumps in light-curves.

INTRODUCTION Thermonuclear supernovae, so-called Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), are the explosive destruction of CO white dwarfs (WDs) in binary or triple systems. They produce at least 50% of the iron-group elements in the Universe, are laboratories of modern and plasma physics (Hoyle & Fowler 1960), and provide a yardstick for modern cosmology. The extraordinary discoveries in cosmology overshadow the diversity of SNe Ia that has emerged in recent years, lead- ing to three main explosion scenarios (Hoeflich & Khokhlov 1996). The first of these considers a surface He detonation (HeD) that triggers a detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-\ud835\udc40Ch) WD with a low-density CO core (Woosley et al. 1980; Nomoto 1982; Hoeflich & Khokhlov 1996). A sec- ond scenario considers a delayed detonation (DD) (Khokhlov 1989a) in which the explosion of a near- \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc36\u210e-mass WD is triggered by compressional heating at high densities, resulting in the production of electron-capture (EC) elements. Here, the flame propagation starts as a deflagration and transitions to a detonation (Khokhlov 1989b). In the third leading sce- nario, two WDs merge or collide in a binary or triplet system, possibly head-on, (Webbink 1984), causing large-scale asym- metries and low-density burning. Despite all efforts, none of the current models are based on \u2018first principles\u2019.
