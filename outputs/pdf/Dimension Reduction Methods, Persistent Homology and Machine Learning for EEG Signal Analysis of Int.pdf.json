  "abstract": "\u2014Recognizing specific events in medical data requires trained personnel. To aid the classification, machine learning algorithms can be applied. In this context, medical records are usually high-dimensional, although a lower dimension can also reflect the dynamics of the signal. In this study, electroen- cephalogram data with Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IEDs) are investigated. First, the dimensions are reduced using Dynamical Component Analysis (DyCA) and Principal Component Analy- sis (PCA), respectively. The reduced data are examined using topological data analysis (TDA), specifically using a persistent homology algorithm. The persistent homology results are used for targeted feature generation. The features are used to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish IEDs from background activities.

INTRODUCTION The evaluation of medical data is increasingly automated. However, it is important that the evaluation is comprehensible and the path of the decision can be interpreted. Feature en- gineering facilitates accessibility to machine learning models and is one of the most frequently used data preprocessing methods [1]. One possibility of feature engineering will be presented in this paper. A combination of dimensionality reduction and persistent homology to generate interpretable features is investigated. The data examined are electroencephalography (EEG) data, which contain Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IED). Two dimension reduction methods are used; one is Principal Com- ponent Analysis (PCA) [2] and the other is the Dynamical Component Analysis (DyCA) [3]. The two methods differ in that DyCA leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem focusing on the dynamic components, whereas PCA is based on a statistical model assumption. II. DATA The data for this study is taken from the Temple University Hospital EEG Corpus [4]. It includes EEG recordings of 24 to 36 channels from epileptic patients of which IEDs are investigated. For this purpose, five different events are A. Stiehl, S. Gei\u00dfels\u00a8oder and C. Uhl are with the University of Applied Sciences Ansbach, Residenzstra\u00dfe 8, Germany, E-Mail: a.stiehl18120@hs-ansbach.de. N. Ille, F. Anselstetter and H. Bornfleth are with BESA GmbH, Freihamer Stra\u00dfe 18, Gr\u00a8afelfing, Germany. available in the processed and filtered data set. Two of the five events can be assigned to IEDs and form the positive class. The remaining event types are background activities and form the negative class for this study. The raw data were resampled to 128 Hz, bandpass filtered and remontaged to different virtual EEG montages using the commercially available software package BESA Research (BESA GmbH, Gr\u00a8afelfing, Germany). In this study the bipolar (28 channels), the average (27 channels) and the Cz reference montage (27 channels) were examined. III. METHODS A. Dynamical Component Analysis The Dynamical Component Analysis (DyCA) is a dimen- sion reduction method based on modeling the simulated or measured signal by a series of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [3]. The principal aim of the algorithm is to split a signal q(t) \u2208RN, where N describes the number of dimen- sions, into a deterministic part, P xi(t)wi, and an independent noise component, P \u03bej(t)\u03c8j: q(t) = n X i=1 xi(t)wi + p X j=1 \u03bej(t)\u03c8j (1) assuming that n + p \u2264N and wi, \u03c8j being linearly inde- pendent. The dynamics of the deterministic amplitudes xi(t) of the signal q(t) is assumed to be driven by a system of m linear and n \u2212m nonlinear differential equations, with m \u2265n \u2212m. Defining correlation matrices a generalized eigenvalue problem arises. Projecting the high-dimensional signal onto its generalized eigenvectors a low-dimensional signal representation is obtained. B. Persistent Homology Persistent homology is one of the standard tools from statistical topological data analysis (TDA) [5]. Its goal is the analysis of data represented by a point cloud in N dimensions. Thereby persistent homology provides a multiscale description of the topology of the point cloud. To calculate the topological features of the given data, the point cloud must be represented as a simplicial complex, in most implementations the Vi- etoris\u2013Rips complex is used [6]. Various visualization options for the analyses are provided, like the persistence barcodes or persistence landscapes. The persistence landscape (PL) is a sequence of piecewise linear functions \u03bbk \u2208R+ with k \u2208N arXiv:2502.12814v1 [eess.SP] 18 Feb 2025"
