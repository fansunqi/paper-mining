  "abstract": "Context. Cosmic Voids are a promising probe of cosmology for spectroscopic galaxy surveys due to their unique response to cosmo- logical parameters. Their combination with other probes promises to break parameter degeneracies. Aims. Due to simplifying assumptions, analytical models for void statistics are only representative of a subset of the full void popula- tion. We present a set of neural-based emulators for void summary statistics of watershed voids, which retain more information about the full void population than simplified analytical models. Methods. We build emulators for the void size function and void density profiles traced by the halo number density using the Quijote suite of simulations for a broad range of the \u039bCDM parameter space. The emulators replace the computation of these statistics from computationally expensive cosmological simulations. We demonstrate the cosmological constraining power of voids using our emulators, which offer orders-of-magnitude acceleration in parameter estimation, capture more cosmological information compared to analytic models, and produce more realistic posteriors compared to Fisher forecasts. Results. We find that the parameters \u2126m and \u03c38 in this Quijote setup can be recovered to 14.4% and 8.4% accuracy respectively using void density profiles; including the additional information in the void size function improves the accuracy on \u03c38 to 6.8%. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach to two important variables in the underlying simulations, the resolution, and the inclusion of baryons. We find that our pipeline is robust to variations in resolution, and we show that the posteriors derived from the emulated void statistics are unaffected by the inclusion of baryons with the Magneticum hydrodynamic simulations. This opens up the possibility of a baryon-independent probe of the large-scale structure. Key words. large-scale structure of Universe \u2013 cosmological parameters \u2013 Methods: statistical 1. Introduction Cosmological surveys of the past decade (Hill et al. 2008; Daw- son et al. 2013a; de Jong et al. 2013; Bleem et al. 2015; Miyazaki et al. 2015; Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016) and the future (LSST Science Collaboration et al. 2009; Laureijs et al. 2011; de Jong et al. 2012; Levi et al. 2013; Takada et al. 2014; Maartens et al. 2015; Spergel et al. 2015; Predehl et al. 2021) map the large-scale structure of the universe with unprecedented statistical power, which has enabled the pre- cise inference of cosmological parameters. These modern sur- veys are able to measure the distribution of galaxies with very high accuracy, which has allowed for the use of cosmic voids as cosmological probes (e.g., Contarini et al. 2022; Hamaus et al. 2022; Bonici et al. 2023; Radinovi\u00b4c et al. 2023; Song et al. 2025). For a robust cosmological analysis of voids, survey depth and completeness of galaxy catalogs is important as to not falsely identify regions of unobserved galaxies as voids. At the same time, their size is on the scale of tens of Megaparsec, and they make up the majority of the volume of the universe (Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004), meaning a large survey volume is also required. Due to these limitations, their study has only recently \u22c6Corresponding author; e-mail: kai.lehman@physik.lmu.de become feasible with the advent of precision cosmology (see Pisani et al. 2019; Moresco et al. 2022, for a recent review). The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) (Dawson et al. 2013b), measuring spectroscopic redshifts of 1.5 million galaxies, has shown that such surveys are ideal for void studies. Statistics describing the observed BOSS void populations have been shown to be useful for cosmological parameter inference, including, for example their abundance (Contarini et al. 2023; Song et al. 2025), the Alcock-Paczy\u00b4nski test (Alcock & Paczynski 1979; Hamaus et al. 2016, 2020) or the void probability function (Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2024). An especially promising property of cosmic voids currently sparking further investigation is their complementary response to cosmological parameters with other probes of the large-scale structure. For example, the well-known \u2126m-\u03c38 degeneracy, typically obtained from 3x2pt analyses or cluster number counts, exhibits an orthogonal correlation direction when extracted from the void size function (VSF; Pelliciari et al. 2023; Contarini et al. 2023). More generally, voids are complementary to overdense structures like halos, and a combi- nation of the two probes is expected to break crucial parameter degeneracies (Kreisch et al. 2022). These analyses are very promising and while it has been shown that some of the fundamental void properties follow sim- Article number, page 1 of 13 arXiv:2502.05262v1 [astro-ph.CO] 7 Feb 2025"
