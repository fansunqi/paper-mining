  "abstract": "We consider the balanced exchange of bundles of indivisible goods. We are interested in mechanisms that only rely on marginal preferences over individual objects even though agents\u2019 actual preferences compare bundles. Such mechanisms play an important role in two-sided matching but have not received much attention in exchange settings. We show that individu- ally rational and Pareto-efficient marginal mechanisms exist if and only if no agent ever ranks any of her endowed objects lower than in her second indifference class. We call such marginal preferences trichotomous. In proving sufficiency, we define mechanisms, which are constrained versions of serial dictatorship, that achieve both desiderata based only agents\u2019 marginal pref- erences. We then turn to strategy-proofness. An individually rational, efficient and strategy-proof mechanism\u2014marginal or not\u2014exists if and only if each agent\u2019s marginal preference is not only trichotomous, but does not contain a non-endowed object in her second indifference class. We call such marginal preferences strongly trichotomous. For such preferences, our mechanisms re- duce to the class of strategy-proof mechanisms introduced in Manjunath and Westkamp (2021). For trichotomous preferences, while our variants of serial dictatorship are not strategy-proof, they are truncation-proof and not obviously manipulable (Troyan and Morrill, 2020). 1 Introduction We study the balanced exchange of bundles of indivisible objects. In such settings, reporting full preferences over bundles of indivisible objects can be a daunting task. For example, if an agent is endowed with k objects and there are a total of N objects, then there are \u0000N k \u0001 different bundles she could end up with. Even for very modest sized problems, this is an unreasonably large number: with just ten agents, each of whom is endowed with only three objects, there are 4060 different bundles that each of them could consume. That it is impractical to expect an agent to even know, much less communicate, preferences over such a large set has been previously noted in the literature (Milgrom, 2009, 2010, 2011; Othman et al., 2010; Budish and Kessler, 2018). Asking each agent to submit a rank-order list over objects is far more tractable. This is the approach taken, for instance, in the National Resi- dent Matching Program: hospitals have preferences over bundles of doctors but submit a ranking of individual doctors.
