  "abstract": ". This paper examines the representations of hyperbolic inte- gral homology spheres into the binary icosahedral group 2I. We specif- ically give a geometric meaning to 2I representations by relating them to Larsen\u2019s notion of quotient dimension, which gives us a sense of the frequency of regular finite covers. Our main theorem shows that hy- perbolic 3-manifolds can only have quotient dimension 2 or 3, and each case is obtained infinitely many times. More specifically, we show that those with no non-trivial A5 representations have quotient dimension 3, and we find a family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on an infinite 2-bridge hyperbolic knot family with quotient dimension 2. Keywords: Quotient dimension, A5 representations, hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Introduction The classification and characterization of 3-manifolds is a key aim in low- dimensional topology. William Thurston\u2019s 1997 Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Perelman in 2003, places fundamental groups at the heart of the study of 3-manifolds, establishing the fundamental group \u03c01 as a primary tool for distinguishing between different closed 3-manifolds [21]. Indeed, Perel- man\u2019s proof tells us that fundamental groups determine closed, orientable 3-manifolds up to orientations of the prime factors and up to the indeter- minacy arising from lens spaces [15] [17] [16]. The Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, a special case of the Geometrization Conjecture, asserts that any simply con- nected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the three dimensional sphere S3, characterizing S3 as the unique, simply connected, closed 3-manifold. For 3-manifolds non-homeomorphic to S3, it is useful to somehow quantify the non-triviality of their fundamental groups. The Geometrization Theo- rem implies that 3-manifolds have residually finite fundamental groups, so we can measure non-triviality by considering the representations to finite groups. However, there is no finite group G such that every 3-manifold\u2019s fundamental group has a non-trivial homomorphism to G. We thus seek a different uniform measure of non-triviality via the following conjecture from Kirby\u2019s 1997 list of problems in low-dimensional topology [11, 3.15A]. Conjecture (Kirby, 3.15A). If Y is a closed, connected, 3-manifold other than S3, then \u03c01pY q admits a non-trivial SUp2q\u00b4representation. This conjecture highlights an important distinction between the 3-sphere, which has a trivial fundamental group, and other homology spheres, which, although they have the same homology as S3, have more complex fundamen- tal groups that can be mapped non-trivially into SUp2q. Zentner showed in 2018 that the conjecture is true if SUp2q is replaced by SL2pCq [24]. In fact, 1 arXiv:2502.06488v1 [math.GT] 10 Feb 2025"
