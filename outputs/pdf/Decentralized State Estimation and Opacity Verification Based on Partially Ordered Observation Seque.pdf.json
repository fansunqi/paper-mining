  "abstract": "\u2014In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a synchronization occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator\u2019s viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of an All Sequence Structure (ASS), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the ASS, we then construct corre- sponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of ASS demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.

INTRODUCTION W ITH the proliferation of information technology, net- work connectivity, and sensing capabilities, there is an increasing utilization of highly complex systems composed of multiple components that collaborate to fulfill intricate tasks, such as communication networks, autonomous vehicles, and other advanced cyber and cyber-physical systems. These systems are often mathematically captured using discrete event systems (DESs), which are typically characterized by discrete states and event-triggered dynamics. DESs are widely used in modeling and analyzing the higher logical behavior of these complex systems. Due to the limited sensing capability of a plant, we may not have full information about the system\u2019s internal state, which is needed to solve an array of control problems and/or to verify certain properties of the system. Therefore, the state estimation problem [1] is of great importance in practical applications. Depending on the time instant at which state estimates are needed, different notions have been proposed and studied, Dajiang Sun is with the School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, 710071, China (e-mail: djsun@stu.xidian.edu.cn).

Dealing with these estimation tasks depends on the observed system behavior. Normally, an observation architecture consists of a system itself, an observation site that observes the system, and a computational unit that analyzes the data provided by the observation site. However, emerging complex and large-scale systems have given rise to decentralized observation structures [6], where there may not exist a monolithic observation site that is able to record all accessible information generated by the system. In this paper, we concentrate on initial- and current-state estimation (and corresponding property verification problems) under a decentralized observation structure, where the infor- mation received by the coordinator is a set of partially ordered sequences of observations recorded at local sites. State estimation serves as the basis for various so-called state isolation properties, such as diagnosability [7]\u2013[9], de- tectability [10], [11], and opacity [12], [13]. In the absence of a monolithic observer, two main architectures\u2014decentralized and distributed\u2014are used to describe property verification. Debouk et al. [6] focus on the case of two observation sites and propose three protocols for coordinated decentral- ized diagnosis, with the third protocol being directly linked to co-diagnosability. A polynomial time approach for the verification of co-diagnosability is proposed in [14]. Further- more, the co-diagnosability of a networked DES, considering communication delays and intermittent losses of observations, is addressed in [15]. The work in [16] studies a decentral- ized fault diagnosis problem modeled by Mealy automata under state-dependence and nondeterministic output functions. Additionally, co-diagnosability and K-co-diagnosability are explored within the framework of Petri nets [17]. The prob- lems of decentralized diagnosis under disjunctive and con- junctive decision-making processes are analyzed in [18], [19]. A general distributed protocol for fault diagnosis and state estimation, called DiSIR, is studied in [20] in the absence of a coordinator. In [21], the authors address the problem of robust decentralized diagnosis of DES against transient failures in the communication of the observations to the local diagnosers. Li et. al. [22] deal with decentralized fault diagnosis when the information received by the coordinator involves state estimates, possible corrupted due to attacks on the communication channels. For more details, readers are referred to survey papers [23]\u2013[25] and book [2] on this topic. The notion of opacity introduced in [26], [27] for transition systems ensures that an intruder cannot determine whether a arXiv:2502.10367v1 [eess.SY] 14 Feb 2025"
