  "abstract": "A graph G is a cover of a graph F if there exists an onto mapping \u03c0 : V (G) \u2192 V (F), called a (covering) projection, such that \u03c0 maps the neighbours of any ver- tex v in G bijectively onto the neighbours of \u03c0(v) in F. This paper is the \ufb01rst attempt to study the connection between domination parameters and graph cov- ers. We focus on the domination number, the total domination number, and the connected domination number. We prove tight upper bounds for the domination parameters of G. Moreover, we prove lower bounds for the domination parame- ters of G. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the lower bound for the domination number of G and provide evidence to support the conjecture.

For a graph F, let V (F) and E(F) respectively denote the vertex set and the edge set of F. A graph G is a cover of a graph F if there exists an onto mapping \u03c0 : V (G) \u2192V (F), called a (covering) projection, such that \u03c0 maps the neighbours of any vertex v in G bijectively onto the neighbours of \u03c0(v) in F. Note that every graph is a cover of itself via the identity projection. If F is connected, then |\u03c0\u22121(v)| = k is the same for all v \u2208V (F) and \u03c0 is called a k-fold cover. We often call a 2-fold cover a double cover. See Figure 1 for an example of a cover. Here, we can de\ufb01ne the vertex projection \u03c0 by \u00b6Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Australia (d.annor@latrobe.edu.au).
