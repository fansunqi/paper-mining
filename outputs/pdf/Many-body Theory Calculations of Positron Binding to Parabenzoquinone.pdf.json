(Dated: February 17, 2025) Positron binding in parabenzoquinone is studied using ab initio many-body theory. The effects of electron-positron correlations including polarization, virtual positronium formation and positron- hole repulsion, as well as those of \u03c0 bonds, aromaticity, and lone electron pairs, are considered. The binding energy is calculated as 60\u00b116 meV, considerably larger than the 0.0925 meV value inferred from recent scattering calculations of [G. Moreira and M. Bettega, Eur. Phys. J. D 78 (2024)], but substantially smaller than we find in benzene (148\u00b126 meV). The positron contact density (lifetime) is calculated as 8.0\u00d710\u22123 a.u. (2.48 ns), vs. 1.61\u00d710\u22122 a.u. (0.81 ns) in benzene. The decrease (increase) in binding (annihilation rate) in parabenzoquinone compared to benzene is ascribed to the loss of aromaticity: the electron density on the positive oxygen nuclei being relatively harder for the positron to probe compared to the aromatic rings in benzene. I. INTRODUCTION Positron interactions with molecules are characterized by strong many-body correlations between the molecular electrons and the positron, which makes these interac- tions challenging to accurately model. Positron binding has been measured for over 100 molecules [1\u20136] and re- cent progress in the theory of positron-molecule inter- actions has lead to the prediction of positron binding to a wide range of molecules, including alkanes, polar molecules, amino acids and ringed molecules [6\u201314]. Our many-body theory method provides an accurate ab initio approach to calculating positron-molecule binding ener- gies and facilitates the systematic inclusion of different types of correlation effects. The approach remains in its infancy, but has demonstrated considerable success in predicting positron-molecule bound state energies in good agreement with experiment [6, 12\u201314], and also has proven capability to describe positron-molecule scatter- ing [15] and positronic bonding [16]. In the present paper, we focus on the parabenzo- quinone (pBQ) molecule, C6H4O2. Scattering calcula- tions by Moreira and Bettega using the Schwinger multi- channel method inferred the presence of a positron-pBQ bound state with binding energy 0.0925 meV [17]. Here, we use many-body theory to calculate the energy of the positron bound state in pBQ, the corresponding positron wavefunction and the contact density (positron lifetime). Parabenzoquinone is a planar ringed molecule with a six- carbon ring: four of the carbon atoms have hydrogen atoms bonded to them and the remaining two, which are at opposite sides of the ring, are bonded to oxygen atoms. The structure of this molecule is shown in Figure 1. This molecule is similar in structure to benzene, for \u2217sgregg07@qub.ac.uk \u2020 d.green@qub.ac.uk which positron binding has been previously studied using our many-body theory [6], leading to a natural compar- ison between the two molecules. Notably, for benzene our ab initio approach highlighted quantitatively the en- hanced importance of \u03c0 bonds on the strength of the positron-molecule correlation potential and thus binding energies [6, 12], confirming previous speculation by ex- periment and model calculations [2, 11]. In contrast to benzene, pBQ is not aromatic; whilst there are \u03c0-bonded molecular orbitals (MOs), the electron density is localised on the lone electron pairs (non-bonding MOs) on the oxy- gen atoms. Here, we find that compared to benzene, the lack of aromaticity in pBQ leads to a reduced binding energy. FIG. 1. Structure diagram of the parabenzoquinone molecule. Single (double) lines represent single (double) bonds. Oxygen (O) atoms are labelled, and unlabelled vertices are carbon atoms with a number of hydrogen atoms attached such that each of the four valence electrons of the carbon atom is in- volved in a bond. The contents of this paper are as follows. Section II briefly outlines the many-body theory used in the binding calculation. Section III contains our calculated binding energies and positron wavefunction, discusses the effect of \u03c0 bonds and lone electron pairs on the positron bound state and compares the positron bound state of pBQ with that of benzene. Section IV contains a brief summary. arXiv:2502.10327v1 [physics.chem-ph] 14 Feb 2025"
