Speci\ufb01cally, we examine the analytic e\ufb00ects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on the classical \ufb01eld equations of the Szekeres system. Our \ufb01ndings show that the deformed algebra leads to a modi\ufb01ed Szekeres system capable of describing cosmic acceleration. Moreover, the spatial curvature of the spacetime is in\ufb02uenced by the presence of the minimum length. PACS numbers: Keywords: Inhomogeneous cosmology, minimum length, acceleration. 1. INTRODUCTION Scalar \ufb01eld in\ufb02ation is the main mechanism used to explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the present universe. The scalar \ufb01eld dominates in driving the dynamics and explaining the expansion era [1, 2]. Nevertheless, scalar \ufb01eld in\ufb02ationary models are primarily de\ufb01ned on homogeneous spacetimes or background spaces with small inhomogeneities [3, 4]. In [5], it was found that the presence of a positive cosmological constant in Bianchi cosmologies leads to expanding Bianchi spacetimes evolving toward the de Sitter universe. This was the \ufb01rst result supporting the cosmic \u201cno-hair\u201d conjecture [6, 7]. The conjecture posits that \u2217Electronic address: anpaliat@phys.uoa.gr"
