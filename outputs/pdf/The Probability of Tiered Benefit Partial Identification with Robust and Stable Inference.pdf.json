  "abstract": "We de\ufb01ne the probability of tiered bene\ufb01t in scenarios with a binary exposure and an outcome that is either ordered categorical with K \u22652 tiers or continuous partitioned by K \u22121 \ufb01xed thresholds into disjoint intervals. Similar to other pure counterfactual queries, this parameter is not g-identi\ufb01able without additional assumptions. We demonstrate that strong monotonicity does not suf\ufb01ce for point identi\ufb01cation when K \u22653 and provide sharp bounds both with and without this constraint. Infer- ence and uncertainty quanti\ufb01cation for these bounds are challenging due to potential nonregularity induced by ambiguities in the individualized optimization problems underlying the bounds. Such ambiguities can arise from immunities or null treatment effects in subpopulations with positive probability, affecting the lower bound estimate and hindering conservative inference. To address these issues, we extend the available stabilized one-step correction (S1S) procedure by incorpo- rating stratum-speci\ufb01c stabilizing matrices. Through simulations, we illustrate the bene\ufb01ts of this approach over existing alternatives. We apply our method to estimate bounds on the probability of tiered bene\ufb01t and harm from ADHD pharmacological treatment upon academic achievement, em- ploying observational data from Norwegian schoolchildren with ADHD. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that although girls and children with previously low numeracy scores experience moderate probabilities of both treatment bene\ufb01t and harm, in no group does the minimum bene\ufb01t surpass the maximum harm, complicating a clear-cut treatment recommendation.

Introduction Counterfactual inference involves probabilistic assessments of events for which certain causal an- tecedents or consequences are contrary to facts (Balke and Pearl, 1994a,b). An exemplar scenario is determining the probability that a given student would have passed a math quali\ufb01cation test had they taken ADHD medication, given that they did not actually take it and failed the test. The scope of application of counterfactual queries spans across diverse domains such as epidemiology, economics, legal deliberation, psychology, and AI (Pearl, 2009). Notably, it \ufb01nds high utility in explainability of machine learning (Beckers, 2022), event attribution (Hannart et al., 2016), impact assessment (Possebom and Riva, 2022), fairness analysis (Ple\u02c7cko and Bareinboim, 2024), and per- sonalized decision-making (Mueller and Pearl, 2023a), among other tasks. \u00a9 2025 J. de Aguas, S.
