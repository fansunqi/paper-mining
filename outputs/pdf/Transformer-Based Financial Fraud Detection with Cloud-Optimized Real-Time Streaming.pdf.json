  "abstract": ". As the financial industry becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital systems, fraud detection systems must evolve to meet growing threats. Cloud-enabled Transformer models present a transformative opportunity to address these challenges. By leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and advanced AI capabilities of cloud platforms, companies can deploy fraud detection solutions that adapt to real-time data patterns and proactively respond to evolving threats. Using the Graph self-attention Transformer neural network module, we can directly excavate gang fraud features from the transaction network without constructing complicated feature engineering. Finally, the fraud prediction network is combined to optimize the topological pattern and the temporal transaction pattern to realize the high- precision detection of fraudulent transactions. The results of anti-fraud experiments on credit card transaction data show that the proposed model outperforms the 7 baseline models on all evaluation indicators: In the transaction fraud detection task, the average accuracy (AP) increased by 20% and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased by 2.7% on average compared with the benchmark graph attention neural network (GAT), which verified the effectiveness of the proposed model in the detection of credit card fraud transactions.
