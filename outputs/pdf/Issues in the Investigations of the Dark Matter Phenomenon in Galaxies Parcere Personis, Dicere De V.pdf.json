  "abstract": "It is always more evident that the kinematics of galaxies provide us with unique information on the Nature of the dark particles and on the properties of the galaxy Dark Matter (DM) halos. However, in investigating this topic, we have to be very careful about certain issues related to the assumptions that we take or to the practices that we follow. Here, we critically discuss such issues, that, today, result of fundamental importance, in that we have realized that the Nature of the DM will be not provided by \u201cThe Theory\u201d but, has to be inferred by reverse engineering the observational scenario. Keywords: dark matter; galaxy kinematics; nature of the dark particle 1. Introduction In the late 70\u2019, the kinematics of galaxies started to make very evident the presence in them of a non-luminous mass component ([1]). In the following decades, these obser- vations have increased in number, quality and importance and have set the scene for the Phenomenon of Dark Matter (DMP) at galactic scales ( [2]). However, it is well known that, today, observations do not comply (a review in: [3]) with the properties of the DM halo density profiles predicted by preferred theoretical cosmological scenarios, headed by the WIMPs, but including also Ultra Light Axions, Sterile Neutrinos, Self Interacting DM (e.g., [4,5]). In this fundamental cosmological field we are now witnessing a change of paradigm: the strategy of solving the DMP mystery does not imply anymore to adopt a theoretical scenario for the dark particle and then to verify its predictions vs. observa- tions score [6,7] but, instead, to exploit the observed properties of the DM in galaxies as a portal to the underlying theoretical scenario. Therefore, the galaxy kinematics takes a role much more relevant than that of a simple validation of some assumed physics, an then we must make sure that the process of study, analysis and interpretation of relevant data be extremely accurate and scenario-independent. Contrary to these requirements, several beliefs, assumptions and practices, well present in literature over the past 30 years, result incorrect/unjustified and jeopardize the investigation of the DMP. While the properties of the dark and luminous matter com- ponents in Galaxies have been determined in a number of works (see: [3]), in the present one we aim to critically discuss such beliefs, assumptions and practices with the goal of clarifying the situation for the benefit of the scientific community. These issues are not \u201cniche topics\u201d, but they concern fundamental aspects of the investigation of the DMP in galaxies. Moreover, we expect that this work will be of widespread interest in that a very large number of published works are involved 1, at different levels, with the various issues that we will discuss in next sections. However, none of them will be cited in this work 2 , in that our aim is just to point out, in the issues 1\u20136, certain critical situations in which the taken approach prevents the body of evidence obtained about the galaxy Dark Matter from speaking out about its Nature. Let us also stress that this work concerns few specific aspects of the mass modeling of galaxies. A complete discussion of the pipeline required for the full investigation of the DMP in galaxies is beyond the scope of this work.
