Diophantine approximation explores how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rationals, with foundational results by Dirichlet, Hurwitz, and Liouville culminating in Roth\u2019s theorem. Schmidt\u2019s subspace theorem extends Roth\u2019s result to higher dimensions, with profound implications for Diophantine equations and transcendence theory. This article provides a self- contained and accessible exposition of Roth\u2019s theorem and Schlickewei\u2019s re\ufb01nement of Schmidt\u2019s subspace theorem, with an emphasis on proofs. The arguments presented are classical and ap- proachable for readers with a background in algebraic number theory, serving as a streamlined, yet condensed reference for these fundamental results. 1. Introduction Diophantine approximation originates from the study of how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers. The \ufb01rst result in this direction was due to Dirichlet, who showed that if \u03b1 \u2208R is an irrational number, then there are in\ufb01nitely many rational numbers p q (with p, q coprime) such that |\u03b1 \u2212p q | < 1 q2 . Note that this result is clearly false when \u03b1 \u2208Q. Dirichlet\u2019s result motivates further questions about how well an irrational number may be approximated by rationals. Indeed, one would like to know if better approximations than those given by Dirichlet\u2019s theorem do exist. Hurwitz improved upon Dirichlet\u2019s result, by showing that the bound 1 q2 can be improved to 1 \u221a 5q2 . The constant 1 \u221a 5 is optimal in the sense that replacing 1 \u221a 5 with a smaller constant makes the result false for certain quadratic irrationals \u03b1. Liouville [Lio44] was the \ufb01rst to provide a signi\ufb01cant result in this direction by proving that algebraic numbers of degree greater than 1 cannot be approximated \"too well\" by rationals. Speci\ufb01cally, he showed that if \u03b1 is an algebraic number of degree d \u22652, then there exists a constant C > 0 such that |\u03b1 \u2212p q | > C qd for all rational numbers p q . However, Liouville\u2019s bound is not sharp for algebraic numbers of degree greater than 2, and this led to the eventual development of sharper results due to Thue [Thu09], Siegel [Sie21], Dyson [Dys47] and Gelfond [Gel52], \ufb01nally culminating in Roth\u2019s theorem. Roth\u2019s theorem states that for any \u03b5 > 0, there are only \ufb01nitely many rational approximations p q such that |\u03b1 \u2212p q | < 1 q2+\u03b5 . Unlike Liouville\u2019s theorem, this does not depend on the degree of \u03b1. Lang [Lan60] and Leveque [LeV61] generalized Roth\u2019s theorem to include approximations involving valuations at places in any number \ufb01eld K. In earlier work Ridout [Rid58] had obtain such results over Q. Schmidt [Sch71, Sch80, Sch89] further extended the ideas and introduced the subspace theorem, which generalizes Roth\u2019s result to higher-dimensional settings. The subspace theorem states that if a set of linear forms satis\ufb01es certain non-degeneracy conditions, then the solutions to an inequality involving these forms lie in a \ufb01nite union of proper subspaces. Schmidt\u2019s subspace theorem has had profound implications in Diophantine equations, transcendence theory, and the distribution of rational and integral points on varieties. For further details, we refer to [CZ02, BG06, CZ18]. An extension of Schmidt\u2019s theorem allowing for completions over a \ufb01nite set of places, entirely analogous to Ridout\u2019s and Lang\u2019s generalizations of Roth\u2019s theorem, was later obtained by Schlickewei [Sch77]. Faltings [Fal91] subsequently introduced powerful geometric techniques that complemented and extended Schmidt\u2019s work, leading to a signi\ufb01cant generalization now known as 2010 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 11J87.
