Llu\u00b4\u0131s Companys 23, 08010 Barcelona, Spain (Dated: February 11, 2025) We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional. The problem of two interacting bodies has a central importance in diverse areas of physics ranging from ce- lestial mechanics and general relativity [1\u20133] to classical electrodynamics [4]. In quantum mechanics, it under- lies the solution of the hydrogen atom and the theory of scattering [5]. Two-body physics also rules the ther- modynamic description of ultracold atomic gases [6, 7] since their interaction range is much smaller than their de Broglie wave lengths and average interparticle distances. In particular, the zero-range scattering problem has been solved in three-dimensional free space [5], in quasi-one- dimensional [9] and in quasi-two-dimensional [8] geome- tries. The spectrum of a harmonically-confined pair of atoms was obtained in any spatial dimension [10]. In these cases, the solution of the two-body problem is sim- plified by its separability into two independent single- particle problems: one for the center-of-mass free dy- namics, another for the relative motion of the particles. The separability is however not assured if the parti- cles are constrained to move in optical lattices [11, 12], in mixed dimensional setups [13\u201316], in anharmonic [17, 18] or species-dependent harmonic [19, 20] potentials, or in spatial domains which are compact or curved. In par- ticular, solving the two-body problem in curved setups is more difficult than in flat counterparts, but funda- mentally valuable for discovering new quantum mechan- ical behaviors induced by the curved geometry [21]. In- deed, the solution of one and two-body problems on a spherical surface evidenced interesting consequences as- sociated to curvature and to non-separability. For in- stance, there were studies of p-wave dimers moving un- der a geometrically-induced gauge field [22], of s-wave scattering of one body [23] and of two-bodies on a large sphere [24], of the gas-to-soliton crossover [25], and of the anyonic spectrum on the sphere [26, 27]. These develop- ments address the fundamental theoretical issue of under- standing few-body physics in curved geometries, and are potentially interesting for experiments with shell-shaped gases [29, 30] and with other low-dimensional curved ge- ometries [31]. In this Letter, we calculate the ground state energy and wave function of two atoms confined to a sphere varying the scattering length a and the total angular momentum j. Technically, at fixed j the problem is reduced to a finite set of coupled differential equations for the relative wave function. We derive these equations by adapting to our case the rigid-rotor formalism of Ref. [22]. We find that for a small dimer, when a is much smaller than R/\u221aj (R is the sphere radius), the wave function is well ap- proximated by the product of the isotropic relative wave function, the same as in the flat case, and the wave func- tion of the center-of-mass motion with angular momen- tum j. However, upon increasing a (or j) the dimer be- comes anisotropic; the relative wave function gets more and more squeezed in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the center-of-mass motion. We argue that this squeezing is due to an effective harmonic confine- ment with oscillator length \u223cR/\u221aj acting on the rela- tive degree of freedom. For large j our two-body problem on a sphere can be reduced to a flat-space quasi-one- dimensional problem in this effective harmonic confine- ment. The two-body ground state can be of localized or delocalized character and it can be two dimensional or quasi one dimensional depending on the relationships among the three relevant length scales, a, R, and R/\u221aj. In the rest of the Letter we use the sphere radius as the unit of length, i.e., we set R = 1. Our findings have implications for ongoing experiments with shell-shaped magnetic [28, 29, 32] and optical [30] traps. In these setups one can be able to create rapidly- rotating gases by combining gravity-compensation mech- anisms with phase-imprinting techniques for transferring angular momentum to the gas [33, 34]. Our two-body system on a sphere has four angular degrees of freedom, which admit different parametriza- tions. We will first work with the center-of-mass and relative angles \u20d7u = (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8). Figure 1 shows how the set \u20d7u is related to the single-particle vectors \u20d7r1 and \u20d7r2 (see Appendix A for explicit expressions). The spherical coordinates \u03b1 \u2208[0, 2\u03c0] and \u03b2 \u2208[0, \u03c0] parametrize the center-of-mass vector \u20d7nc = (\u20d7r1 + \u20d7r2)/|\u20d7r1 + \u20d7r2|. The rel- ative vector \u20d7nr = (\u20d7r1 \u2212\u20d7r2)/|\u20d7r1 \u2212\u20d7r2| is parametrized by \u03b1, \u03b2, and by the angle \u03b3 \u2208[0, 2\u03c0] between the geodesic passing by the center of mass and the great circle pass- ing by the north pole. Finally, \u03b8 \u2208[0, \u03c0] is the relative angular distance between the atoms. arXiv:2502.06724v1 [cond-mat.quant-gas] 10 Feb 2025"
