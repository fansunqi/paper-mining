  "abstract": "CHILTON, Columbia University, USA Humor is a social binding agent. It is an act of creativity that can provoke emotional reactions on a broad range of topics. Humor has long been thought to be \u201ctoo human\u201d for AI to generate. However, humans are complex, and humor requires our complex set of skills: cognitive reasoning, social understanding, a broad base of knowledge, creative thinking, and audience understanding. We explore whether giving AI such skills enables it to write humor. We target one audience: Gen Z humor fans. We ask people to rate meme caption humor from three sources: highly upvoted human captions, 2) basic LLMs, and 3) LLMs captions with humor skills. We find that users like LLMs captions with humor skills more than basic LLMs and almost on par with top-rated humor written by people. We discuss how giving AI human-like skills can help it generate communication that resonates with people. 1 Introduction Producing humor is a difficult yet quintessential endeavor that underpins the everyday human experience. Whether it is cracking a joke with coworkers, sending memes to friends, or playfully flirting with a romantic interest on a date, most people interface with humor every day in some capacity. We use humor to connect with people, to impress people, to point out absurdities, to make light of a bad situation, and to recognize universal struggles - big and small. Humor has long been thought to be \u201ctoo difficult\" or \"too human\u201d for AI to generate. Humor is complex, and there is no single formula for it. Different people find different things funny at different times. Humor seems to require social skills to know one\u2019s audience\u2019s point of view, understand human relationships, see things from multiple points of view, and judge what is socially appropriate to make fun of. Humor requires cognitive and reasoning skills because most jokes are clever in some way - they don\u2019t just say the obvious, they construct facts in ways that bring out absurdities, contradictions, and surprises. Humor is a creative act, and it benefits from making keen observations, trying multiple angles, and multiple wordings. Getting a person to do all these things is hard enough. Asking AI to do it is even harder. However, generative AI has created new possibilities for computational humor. From training on large corpora of text, large language models have a broad base of knowledge and an implicit understanding of what humor is. However, even state-of-the-art models are known for being disappointing in their humor abilities [17]. Theories of humor indicate that there are patterns to humor [26], which makes it theoretically possible for generative AI to implicitly learn these patterns, and its attempts at humor show that it generally understands the structure. And yet humor is complex enough that knowing the structure is not enough - it also requires human-like skills such as understanding people, culture, and the human experience. We test whether AI-generated humor that uses creative, social, and cognitive skills can come close to human performance. As a research context, we study the specific problem of generating humorous captions for images posted to Instagram. This is a popular humor type within Gen Z that is widely made and widely appreciated by a well-defined audience. There is ground truth (in the form of upvotes) for what captions the audience finds funny. It is a fairly complex form of humor that uses both visual and language skills to generate, it applies to a wide variety of input images and requires implicit Gen Z cultural knowledge to generate. Our method of generating humor uses three steps, following the divergent and convergent stages often used in cognitive models of creativity. First is an observation phase where AI takes in the image and makes careful observations Authors\u2019 Contact Information: Sean Kim, ssk2245@columbia.edu, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Lydia B.
