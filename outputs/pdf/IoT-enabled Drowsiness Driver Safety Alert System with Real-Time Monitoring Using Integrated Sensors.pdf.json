  "abstract": "\u2014Significant losses in terms of life and property occur from road traffic accidents, which are often caused by drunk and drowsy drivers. Reducing accidents requires effective detection of alcohol impairment and drowsiness as well as real-time driver monitoring. This paper aims to create an Internet of Things (IoT)\u2013enabled Drowsiness Driver Safety Alert System with Real-Time Monitoring Using Integrated Sensors Technology. The system features an alcohol sensor and an IR sensor for detecting alcohol presence and monitoring driver eye movements, respectively. Upon detecting alcohol, alarms and warning lights are activated, the vehicle speed is progressively reduced, and the motor stops within ten to fifteen seconds if the alcohol presence persists. The IR sensor monitors prolonged eye closure, triggering alerts, or automatic vehicle stoppage to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. Data from the IR sensor is transmitted to a mobile phone via Bluetooth for real-time monitoring and alerts. By identifying driver alcoholism and drowsiness, this system seeks to reduce accidents and save lives by providing safer transportation.

INTRODUCTION 1.35 million people worldwide lose their lives in traffic accidents each year [1]. This number is 3,700 for a day only. Many of these are due to driver drowsiness and drunk driven, leading to loss of control at high speeds, for that reason accidents happened. Many rely on alarms to wake up, similar to the need for drowsiness driver safety systems during long journeys. Driver fatigue leads to many fatal accidents due to loss of control at high speeds, causing deaths and severe road damage. For safe transportation, addressing human drowsiness is essential since the number of road accidents caused by sleepy drivers is rising and surpassing other reasons. There are financial, health, and environmental consequences [2]. 93% of road accident deaths worldwide take place in low- and middle-income nations. Most nations lose 3% of their GDP to road accidents [3]. Bangladesh ranks 106th out of 183 nations in terms of the highest number of road accident-related deaths, according to World Health Organization data. Drivers falling asleep is one of the major causes of these accidents. The system assists the driver in receiving an alert for drowsiness. Drunk driving is one of the major causes of accidents as well. Drunk driving is a serious problem that causes many tragic events worldwide. Alcohol and drug use are common among drivers [4]. Drug use is common among drivers involved in accidents. Young drivers are often more closely linked to drug-related driving when they are under 35 [5]. Drug consumption reduces alertness. The purpose of our proposed system also includes \u201cDrunk Driving Detection\u201d. Drivers must ensure they are sober and capable of driving to avoid endangering lives. Drinking may seem harmless, but it becomes dangerous when operating a large vehicle, potentially causing tragic accidents involving innocent people. A drunk driver may operate a vehicle four times in forty-eight minutes on a median before being pulled over. Moreover, the consequences of drunk driving affect a larger number of people than one may think, as it costs each adult in our nation around $500 annually [6]. While many studies detect drowsiness and alcohol impairment, none combine eye blink monitoring, alcohol detection, Bluetooth alerts, vibration notifications, and automatic vehicle stoppage. For example, [7] integrates eye blink detection but lacks full integration of Bluetooth and vehicle stoppage. This research uniquely combines all these elements, making it a valuable contribution to driver safety. This study, \u201cIoT-enabled Drowsiness Driver Safety Alert System with Real-Time Monitoring\u201d can stop these problems and save a lot of lives as well as prevent accidents. This proposed system has two main sections: driver alertness monitoring and alcohol detection, integrated with mobile communication via Bluetooth. When the IR sensor detects closed eyes, it activates vibration, an alarm, and a red warning light after two seconds. If the eyes remain closed, the vehicle slows and stops within 10-15 seconds, controlled 979-8-3503-9431-3/23/$31.00 \u00a92024 IEEE arXiv:2502.00347v1 [cs.CR] 1 Feb 2025"
