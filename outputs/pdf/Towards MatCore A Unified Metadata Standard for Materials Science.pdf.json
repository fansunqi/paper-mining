  "title": "Towards MatCore A Unified Metadata Standard for Materials Science.pdf",
  "abstract": ". The materials science community seeks to support the FAIR principles for computational simulation research. The MatCore Project was recently launched to address this need, with the goal of develop- ing an overall metadata framework and accompanying guidelines. This paper reports on the MatCore goals and overall progress. Historical back- ground context is provided, including a review of the principles underly- ing successful core metadata standards. The paper also presents selected MatCore examples and discusses future plans.
