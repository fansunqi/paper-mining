  "title": "On the Q-Factorization of Power Series.pdf",
  "abstract": ". Any power series with unit constant term can be factored into an in\ufb01nite product of the form Q n\u22651(1 \u2212qn)\u2212an. We give direct formulas for the exponents an in terms of the coe\ufb03cients of the power series, and vice versa, as sums over partitions. As examples, we prove identities for certain partition enumeration functions. Finally, we note q-analogues of our enumeration formulas. In honor of George Andrews and Bruce Berndt for their 85th birthdays 1. Introduction and main results Many major results in number theory, analysis, and combinatorics take the form of \u201ca series equals a product\u201d; in particular, the use of product-sum generating functions is a prevalent method in partition theory. In [1, p. 98, Ex. 2], George E. Andrews considers the factorization of an ordinary power series with unit constant term into a q-product: (1) 1 + \u221e X n=1 r(n)qn = \u221e Y n=1 1 (1 \u2212qn)an . Andrews suggests a recursion by which the r(n) can be calculated from a given sequence an, namely (2) nr(n) = n X j=1 r(n \u2212j) X d|j dad. The reverse problem, where the r(n) are given and the an are calculated recursively, is given by David Bressoud [3, p. 61, Ex. 2.3.10]: (3) nan = Dn \u2212 X d|n d<n dad, where Dm = mr(m) \u2212 m\u22121 X j=1 Djr(m \u2212j).
