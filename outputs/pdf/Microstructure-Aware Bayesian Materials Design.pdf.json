  "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel microstructure-sensitive Bayesian optimization (BO) framework designed to enhance the efficiency of materials discovery by explicitly incorporating microstructural information. Traditional materials de- sign approaches often focus exclusively on direct chemistry-process-property relationships, overlooking the critical role of microstructures. To address this limitation, our framework integrates microstructural descriptors as latent vari- ables, enabling the construction of a comprehensive process-structure-property mapping that improves both predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes. By employing the active subspace method for dimensionality reduction, we identify the most influential microstructural features, thereby reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy in the design process. This approach also enhances the probabilistic modeling capabilities of Gaus- sian processes, accelerating convergence to optimal material configurations with fewer iterations and experimental observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through synthetic and real-world case studies, including the design of Mg2SnxSi1\u2212x thermoelectric materials for energy conversion. Our results underscore the critical role of microstructures in linking processing conditions to material properties, highlighting the potential of a microstructure- aware design paradigm to revolutionize materials discovery. Furthermore, this work suggests that since incorporating microstructure awareness improves the efficiency of Bayesian materials discovery, microstructure characterization stages should be integral to automated\u2014and eventually autonomous\u2014platforms for materials development.

Introduction Materials development has been central to societal progress, marking key historical transitions such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and the Industrial Revolution. The names of these eras highlight the trans- formative impact of new materials on human history. It took nearly hundreds of thousands of years to transi- tion from hunting and gathering to farming [1], about 10,000 years to industrialize, and only 180 years to har- ness atomic power [2, 3]. The computer age began within the last century, with rapid advancements over the past 50 years, and the development of artificial in- telligence has arguably accelerated the rate of accelera- tion in innovation further in the past two decades [4, 5]. Each of these inflections in technology development\u2014 see Fig. 1\u2014have come accompanied by an enhanced ability to control the structure of matter at increasingly finer scales, transforming society along the way [6]. Today, the urgent need for novel materials to address critical challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and sustainable energy [7] requires a funda- mental shift in how materials are discovered and opti- mized. The traditional trial-and-error approach to mate- rial development, while effective in the past, is increas- ingly inadequate for meeting the accelerated pace of in- novation demanded by these global challenges [8, 9]. A key limitation of current methods lies in their treatment of microstructural information. Although advanced techniques now allow microstructures to be character- ized across many length scales, the materials develop- ment process remains largely microstructure-agnostic. Microstructures are rarely treated as direct design tar- gets; instead, they are viewed as emergent by-products of composition and processing choices. For example, in the design of advanced alloys, engineers typically opti- mize elemental compositions and heat-treatment param- eters to achieve specific properties, such as strength or Preprint submitted to Science Advances February 7, 2025 arXiv:2502.03727v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 6 Feb 2025"
