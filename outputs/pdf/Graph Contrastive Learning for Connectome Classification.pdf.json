  "abstract": "\u2014 With recent advancements in non-invasive tech- niques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain\u2019s function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest\u2014referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leverag- ing data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis. I. INTRODUCTION The study of human brain connectivity, both structural and functional, is essential to decipher the brain\u2019s pivotal role in regulating behavior and cognitive processes. Neuroimaging advances, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), enable real-time visualization of brain activity, offering valuable insights into functional connectivity (FC) [1]. Furthermore, structural mapping through techniques such as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) facilitates the construc- tion of macroscopic maps of the physical connections of the brain [2]. These tools have been instrumental in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia [3, 4, 5]. This work focuses on Contrastive Learning (CL) tech- niques applied to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which excel in processing data structured as graphs; see e.g., [6]. CL is a widely used machine learning technique that learns ro- bust representations by enforcing similarity between related *This work was partially funded by CSIC (I+D project 22520220100076UD) and ANII (FCE-1-2023-1-176172) 1Mart\u00b4\u0131n Schmidt, Sara Silva, Federico Larroca and Pablo Mus\u00b4e are with the Facultad de Ingenier\u00b4\u0131a, Universidad de la Rep\u00b4ublica, Montevideo 11300, Uruguay (e-mail: mschmidt@fing.edu.uy; ssilva@fing.edu.uy; flarroca@fing.edu.uy; pmuse@fing.edu.uy).

CL approaches, e.g., the SimCLR framework [7], have achieved significant success in fields such as computer vision. However, only a few CL studies including [8, 9, 10] have focused on graph-structured data, leaving this area underexplored in the literature. In particular, we employ these techniques for subject-level (gender) classification using FC and structural connectomes (SC) extracted from fMRI and dMRI data, respectively. Connectomes are naturally modeled as graphs, where each node corresponds to a region of interest (ROI) and each edge represents the neural connections between ROIs, thereby capturing their intricate and complex rela- tionships [11]. Beyond the specific gender classification task, we aim to contribute in the pathway to advance our understanding of brain networks and develop tools with broader applications in neuroscience. Methodological innovation. A GNN may be understood as a concatenation of several layers, each consisting of a graph convolution followed by a point-wise non-linearity [6]. Graph convolutions are fundamental tools of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) [12], a framework that has recently gained prominence for the analysis of brain networks and associated signals [13, 14]. The rationale behind applying the CL technique to our problem is inspired by Li et al. [15], who initially implemented the GNN architecture used in this study for connectome classification and later proposed a framework incorporating concepts akin to CL [16]. Building on this foundation, our aim is to structure the latent space such that learned representations capture meaningful rela- tionships within the data, ultimately enhancing classification performance. Different from [15, 16], we propose a novel two-stage GNN training scheme. In the first stage, the pre- training phase, the model learns to minimize a supervised similarity-preserving loss, whereas in the fine-tuning phase, a classifier is incorporated into the pipeline for an additional training step. Furthermore, we integrate data augmentation techniques to generate diverse views of the same subject, ensuring that the model achieves a closer alignment between these augmented versions during the pre-training phase. Evaluation protocol. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we compare against a more conventional graph classification framework, where a GNN is trained directly for the task without the additional CL step. This comparison pro- vides insights into the potential advantages of CL in graph- based modeling and its impact on connectome classification performance. Through this study, our work contributes to the growing exploration of advanced representation learning techniques in network neuroscience [17, 18, 19]. arXiv:2502.05109v1 [cs.LG] 7 Feb 2025"
