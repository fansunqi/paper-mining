  "abstract": "Hierarchically organized patterns are ubiquitously found in complex systems. However, this point is frequently misrep- resented in many Sociophysics models, mainly because random initial conditions are by far the most assumed in the literature. In this article, we studied a simple and quasi-aparametric Axelrod model of culture dynamics assuming structured (hi- erarchically organized) initial conditions. As a \ufb01rst remarkable point, the maximum \ufb01nal culture branching is observed to correspond to a highest uncontrollability regime of an entropy based framework described before. Also, this model shows a quantization of culture patterns that can be explained with the aid of that formalism. Keywords: entropy, hierarchical patterns, fractal dimensions, Axelrod model, quantization 1. Introduction. It is a well established fact that both nature and social systems have organized structures [1]. Complex system models often attempt to reproduce those structures. In other words, hierarchically organized structures are usually unveiled through the model features, supposing either random initial con\ufb01gurations or random boundary conditions. However, it should not be the general case. There are many situations where structures determine the evolution of the systems. So hierarchically structured conditions must be taken into account as part of the integral descrip- tion of the dynamics. This fact implies that structures should have a more predominant role in many models. In recent years, some models incorporated the structure in a novel way. For instance, Encarna\u00b8c\u02dcao et al. [2] carried out a 2-D study of Lisbon metropolitan area by using an entropy function, dependent of the built-up area fractal dimension [3]. This quantity rise, acceleration, etc. de\ufb01ne entropic regimes that allow to study local hierarchically organized urban layouts. It provides a natural partition of the city consisting of di\ufb00erent urban dynamics zones, which would eventually requiry particular planning and/or policies. This methodology was also applied by Sun et al. [4] for classifying the structure of deforestation areas in the Amazon rainforest. In addition, a 1-D version of this framework was implemented to characterize temporal Email address: marcosgaudiano@gmail.com (Marcos E. Gaudiano) patterns of public transport strikes [5]. Remarkably, the intrinsic meaning of the entropic regimes used in [2], [4] and [5] turn out to be basically invariant, regardless the fact these works deal with clearly di\ufb00erent systems. Actually, the just above commented works can be seen as particular cases of the general framework described in [6]. In that article, the author explores hierarchically organized patterns in multidimensional complex systems, together with the notion of uncontrollability. It is provided a classi\ufb01cation of system components, which is based on a (generalized) entropy function. We will call it entropic formalism from now on. So far, we have cited three real world examples. However, the entropic formalism has also interesting applications on widely-known theoretical sociophysics 2-D models, when hierarchically organized initial conditions are considered. For example, Sznajd\u2019s model opinion dy- namics was studied in [7]-[8]. One of the main conclusions of these articles is that even under high political apathy, a third emergent party victory is clearly possible. Another example is the segregation Schelling\u2019s model studied in [9]. That article showed how the structure of a social minority clearly determines either the coexistence with the rest or the ocurrence of segregation. Remarkably, it turns out that system\u2019s fate characteriza- tion by using the entropic regimes made the three latter works to be minimalistic in terms of parameters. It also allowed the authors to unveil many morals and observable facts (with highly correspondence to reality) that cannot Preprint submitted to arXiv February 6, 2025"
