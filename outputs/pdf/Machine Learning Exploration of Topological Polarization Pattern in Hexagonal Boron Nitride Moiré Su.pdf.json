  "abstract": "Twisted moir\u00e9 supercell s, which can be approximated as a combination of slid bilayers and constit e vario us topologically nontrivial polarization patte , attract extensive attention recently . However, because of the excessive size of the moir\u00e9 supercell , most studies are based on effe and lack the results first -principles calculation. In this work , we use machine learning to determine the topological structure the polarization pattern in twist ed and strained bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) . We further confirm tha t the topological pattern can be effectively modulated by the vertical electric fie . Finall local polarization also exists in the antiparal h-BN twisted and strained bilayers. Our work pr a detailed study of the polarization pattern in the moir\u00e9 superlattice, which we b research in moir\u00e9 ferroelectricity, topological physics, a Twisted bilayer systems can generate long -wavelength moir\u00e9 patterns , and the resulting band flatten can suppress band dispersion, thereby leading to significant man -body interactions th physical phenomena 1-8. Numerous primitive cells with varying interlayer sli ding can form huge moir\u00e9 pattern , and the corresponding physical quantities , including excitons, magnetization, polariz , and interlayer potential also show a long -wavelength distribution 9-20. Recent studies have the spatia modulation of interlayer sliding can carry sliding ferroelectricity 16, 21 -24.
