Frieman\u2020 Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA (Dated: February 12, 2025) Recent results from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), in com- bination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, have focused renewed attention on dark energy models with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, w(z). In this paper, we describe the simplest, physically motivated models of evolving dark energy that are consistent with the recent data, a broad subclass of the so-called thawing scalar field models. We provide a quasi- universal, quasi-one-parameter functional fit to the scalar-field w\u03d5(z) that captures the behavior of these models more informatively than the standard w0wa phenomenological parametrization; their behavior is completely described by the current value of the equation-of-state parameter, w0 = w(z = 0). Combining current data from SNe Ia (DES-SN5YR), BAO (SDSS + DESI Year 1), the CMB (Planck and ACT), large-scale structure (DES Year-3 3 \u00d7 2pt), and strong lensing (TD- COSMO + SLACS), we obtain w0 = \u22120.908 \u00b1 0.035, 2.6\u03c3 discrepant from the \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) model. The Bayesian evidence ratio substantially favors this w\u03d5CDM model over \u039bCDM. The data combination that yields the strongest discrepancy with \u039bCDM is SNe Ia+BAO, for which w0 = \u22120.840+0.048 \u22120.050, 3.2\u03c3 discrepant from \u039bCDM and with a Bayesian evidence ratio strongly in favor. We find that the so-called S8 tension between the CMB and large-scale structure is slightly reduced in these models, while the Hubble tension is slightly increased. We forecast constraints on these models from near-future surveys (DESI-extension and the Vera Rubin Observatory LSST), showing that the current best-fit w\u03d5CDM model will be distinguishable from \u039bCDM at over 9\u03c3. I. INTRODUCTION Over the last quarter century, the \u039b cold dark mat- ter (\u039bCDM) model, with 70% vacuum energy (equiv- alently the cosmological constant \u039b) and 30% matter (CDM plus baryons), has become the standard cosmo- logical paradigm [e.g., 1]. Until recently, it has proven consistent with an array of increasingly precise measure- ments of cosmic structure and expansion history [e.g., 2\u20134]. Yet it has long been recognized that \u039bCDM is just the simplest version of a broader class of models that can include more complex behaviors in the dark matter or dark energy sectors. Interest in dynamical dark energy models [5] arose in the mid-1990s from what appeared to be observational challenges to the emerging \u039bCDM paradigm from strong lensing statistics [6], the high cosmic microwave back- ground (CMB) normalization of the matter power spec- trum [7], and early Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) results [8]. While those challenges were subsequently resolved by new data [9, 10] or improved data modeling [11\u2013 13], or both, the most recent results from large SN Ia samples such as Pantheon+ [14], Union [15], and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [16], and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Sloan Digi- tal Sky Survey (SDSS) [3] and the Dark Energy Spec- troscopic Instrument (DESI) [17], in combination with Planck CMB anisotropy constraints [2], are again sug- gesting that evolving dark energy models may provide a \u2217ajshajib@uchicago.edu; NHFP Einstein Fellow \u2020 jfrieman@uchicago.edu better fit to the data than \u039bCDM. Neglecting spatial fluctuations, in the fluid approxi- mation, the impact of dark energy on cosmological ob- servables can be quantified in terms of its equation-of- state parameter, the ratio of its energy density to its pressure, w = p/\u03c1. An often-used, two-parameter phe- nomenological prescription for the redshift evolution of w is given by w(z) = w0 + waz/(1 + z) [18, 19], where w0 is the current value, wa characterizes its time evolu- tion, and z is redshift; \u039bCDM corresponds to the par- ticular case w0 = \u22121 and wa = 0. The Pantheon+ SN compilation [14], in combination with the SDSS BAO and Planck CMB results, yielded w0 = \u22120.841+0.066 \u22120.061, wa = \u22120.65+0.28 \u22120.32 for a spatially flat Universe (which we assume throughout), consistent with \u039bCDM at 2\u03c3. The DES 5-year SN survey data (DES-SN5YR) [16], a much larger high-redshift SN sample than previous ones, when combined with the SDSS BAO and Planck CMB results and DES Year-3 weak lensing and galaxy clustering [4], yielded w0 = \u22120.773+0.075 \u22120.067, wa = \u22120.83+0.33 \u22120.42, roughly 3\u03c3 from \u039bCDM. Subsequently, the DESI collaboration [17] put out its first-year BAO results and combined them with Planck CMB and with three separate SN samples. Using the DES-SN5YR sample, they found the great- est (3.9\u03c3) tension with \u039bCDM, w0 = \u22120.727 \u00b1 0.067, wa = \u22121.05+0.31 \u22120.27. When using a combination of DESI and SDSS BAO data with the most precise BAO distance measurement in each redshift bin, they obtained a com- bined constraint w0 = \u22120.761 \u00b1 0.064, wa = \u22120.88+0.29 \u22120.25, 3.5\u03c3 from \u039bCDM and quite close to the DES-SN5YR results in Ref. [16]. While convenient for separating \u201cthawing\u201d (wa < 0) [5, 7] from \u201cfreezing\u201d (wa > 0) [20, 21] dark energy mod- arXiv:2502.06929v1 [astro-ph.CO] 10 Feb 2025"
