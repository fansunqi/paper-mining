  "abstract": "\u2014This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic- Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while re- maining unaffected by the SMIB system\u2019s internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR pro- cedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi- machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models\u2019 control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear\u2013quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, fre- quency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.

INTRODUCTION T HE modern power system, also known as the smart grid, is a highly complex, widely interconnected, large- scale nonlinear system. The stable and reliable operation of power systems has become increasingly challenging with the rapid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines, distributed generation, energy storage systems, complex load profiles like plug-in electric vehicles, and advanced communication technologies into the smart grid. The overall stability of the power grid can be decomposed into the following objectives: a) automatic voltage regulation via excitation control; b) rotor angle stability and load frequency control (LFC) via turbine-governor control; and P.

In addition to multi-machine benchmark models like the IEEE 10-machine 39-bus New England test system [1], the single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system is often used to develop robust control strategies and conduct stability studies on the power grid because it captures the essential dynamics of the generator, turbine-governor system, and power network. Many classical and advanced control strategies have been developed so far for the effective control and stability en- hancement of SMIB and multi-machine power systems. Power system stabilizers have been widely used to enhance the power system\u2019s transient stability in response to minor disturbances by adding damping via excitation control modulation [2]. Novel control approaches using sliding mode control (SMC) [3]\u2013[6] are used for the LFC design in power systems. The control methods in [2]\u2013[6] are based on reduced-order power system models linearized around specific operating points. Therefore, these techniques cannot provide adequate damping and preserve transient stability over a wide range of operating conditions, particularly when power systems experience severe disturbances like three-phase short-circuit faults or sudden fluctuations in load demands. Also, the control approaches in [2]\u2013[6] are not validated on high-fidelity plant models with uncertainties, which are closer reflections of practical multi- machine power systems. Furthermore, the control input chat- tering, saturation, and singularity problems in SMC-based LFC approaches [3]\u2013[6] make them unfeasible for implementation on higher-order nonlinear power system models. Nonlinear controllers, conversely, are unaffected by operat- ing conditions and significantly enhance power system stability and transient performance across a broad spectrum of operat- ing points, even amid severe disturbances or faults [7]\u2013[22]. The feedback linearization technique, which can be broadly classified into three distinct forms, namely, direct feedback linearization (DFL), partial feedback linearization (PFL), and exact feedback linearization (EFL), has been widely used to design excitation controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems [7]\u2013[18]. The DFL methods proposed in [7]\u2013 [10] necessitate the measurement of rotor angle, real and reactive power, real-time calculation of higher-order deriva- tives, and virtual control input design to cancel the system nonlinearities, which reduces the controller\u2019s robustness in the presence of measurement noise and external perturbations. Several PFL techniques for SMIB and multi-machine power systems have been presented to address the DFL limitations arXiv:2502.10889v1 [eess.SY] 15 Feb 2025"
