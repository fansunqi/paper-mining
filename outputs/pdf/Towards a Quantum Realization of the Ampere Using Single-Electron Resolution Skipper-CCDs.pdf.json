  "abstract": ". This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of the Skipper- CCD, a sensor with single-electron counting capability, as a promising technology for implementing an electron-pump-based current source. Relying on its single-electron resolution and built-in charge sensing, it allows self-calibration of the charge packets. This article presents an initial discussion of how low ppm and high current realizations can be achieved with this technology. We report experimental results that illustrate the key functionalities in manipulating both small and large electron charge packets, including a comparison of the charge generated, self-measured, and drained by the sensor against measurements from an electrometer. These results were obtained using a standard sensor and readout electronics without speci\ufb01c optimizations for this application. The objective is to explore the potential of Skipper-CCD for realizing an electron-based current source. 1. Introduction With the recent rede\ufb01nition of the unit of electric current, one ampere corresponds to the \ufb02ow of (1.602176634\u00d710\u221219)\u22121 elementary charges (electrons) per second, based on the fundamental de\ufb01ning constant of the elementary charge, e\u2212= 1.602176634 \u00d7 10\u221219 C [1]. This de\ufb01nition implies that a practical realization of the unit should control the number of electrons that are pumped or drained by a device within a given unit of time, and replaces the previous de\ufb01nition based on ampere\u2019s force law. Over the past 35 years, signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00orts in the \ufb01eld of metrology have focused on single-electron current sources, making possible the generation of currents I = fe\u2212by pumping single-electrons at a speci\ufb01ed frequency f. A variety of realization techniques, along with some of the di\ufb03culties they impose, have been reviewed in [2]."
