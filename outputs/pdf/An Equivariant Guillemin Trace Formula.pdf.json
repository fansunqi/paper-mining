  "title": "An Equivariant Guillemin Trace Formula.pdf",
  "abstract": "Guillemin\u2019s trace formula is an expression for the distributional trace of an operator de\ufb01ned by pulling back functions along a \ufb02ow on a compact manifold. We obtain an equivariant generalisation of this formula, for proper, cocompact group actions. This is motivated by the construction of an equivariant version of the Ruelle dynamical \u03b6- function in another paper by the same authors, which is based on the equivariant Guillemin trace formula. To obtain this formula, we \ufb01rst develop an equivariant version of the distributional trace that appears in Guillemin\u2019s formula and other places.
