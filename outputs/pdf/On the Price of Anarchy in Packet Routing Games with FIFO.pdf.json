  "title": "On the Price of Anarchy in Packet Routing Games with FIFO.pdf",
  "abstract": "We investigate packet routing games in which network users sel\ufb01shly route themselves through a network over discrete time, aiming to reach the destination as quickly as possible. Con\ufb02icts due to limited capac- ities are resolved by the \ufb01rst-in, \ufb01rst-out (FIFO) principle. Building upon the line of research on packet routing games initiated by Werth et al. [24], we derive the \ufb01rst non-trivial bounds for packet routing games with FIFO. Speci\ufb01cally, we show that the price of anarchy is at most 2 for the important and well-motivated class of uniformly fastest route equilibria introduced by Scarsini et al. [17] on any linear multi- graph. We complement our results with a series of instances on linear multigraphs, where the price of stability converges to at least e e\u22121. Furthermore, our instances provide a lower bound for the price of an- archy of continuous Nash \ufb02ows over time on linear multigraphs which establishes the \ufb01rst lower bound of e e\u22121 on a graph class where the monotonicity conjecture is proven by Correa et al. [5]. Keywords: Competitive Packet Routing, FIFO, Price of Anarchy, Price of Stability, Makespan Objective. 1"
