  "abstract": "The classification of seismic events has been crucial for monitoring underground nuclear explosions and unnatural seismic events as well as natural earthquakes. This research is an attempt to apply different machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify various types of seismic events into chemical explosions, collapses, nuclear explosions, damaging earthquakes, felt earthquakes, generic earthquakes and generic explosions for a dataset obtained from IRIS-DMC. One major objective of this research has been to identify some of the best ML algorithms for such seismic events classification. The ML algorithms we are implementing in this study include logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayes, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis. Our implementation of the above ML classifier algorithms required to prepare and preprocess the dataset we obtained so that it will be fit for the ML training and testing applications we sought. After the implementation of the ML algorithms, we were able to classify the seismic event types into seven classes in the dataset, and a comparison of each classifier is made to identify the best algorithm for the seismic data classification. Finally, we made predictions of the different event types using the different classifier algorithms, and evaluated each of the various classifier algorithms for seismic prediction using different evaluation metrics. These evaluation metrics helped us to measure the performance of each algorithm. After implementing the seven ML algorithms and a comparison among those various ML algorithms, it has been demonstrated that the best accuracy among these classifiers happened for the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, with an accuracy of 93.5%.

Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) has been playing an important role in the development of new approaches for seismic studies. Seismic studies include the study of earthquakes (natural and man-made shaking of the earth), seismic waves and what those waves tell us about the internal structure and composition of the Earth. Moreover, seismic signal processing has played an important role in the detection and monitoring of underground nuclear explosions. Both global and exploration seismology have been employing various ML algorithms over the last three decades at various levels [1- 4]. Exploration seismology in particular has been implementing all sorts of cutting-edge technologies including AI and ML [5-7] for the purpose of exploring the earth locally. In this study we will be making use of global seismology data analyzed at a regional level. Seismology is a data-driven science and its most important discoveries usually result from analysis of new data sets and/or development of new data analysis methods [8]. The classification of seismic events is crucial for monitoring underground nuclear explosions and detecting regional unnatural seismic events and also to classify tectonic earthquakes, explosions and mining induced earthquakes [9]. Seismic signal processing has been a data rich science. Application of machine learning for gaining new insights from such rich seismic data processing is a rapidly evolving sub-field in seismology [10]. The main objective of this research is to apply different machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify seismic event types such as chemical explosions, collapses, nuclear explosions, damaging earthquakes, felt earthquakes, generic earthquakes and generic explosions in a dataset obtained from IRIS-DMC the data is called Earth scope. In the past few years, different seismic event classification studies using ML algorithms have been published. However, most of those papers have two or three classes, and few of them have four classes. Moreover, many of those published works use very few ML algorithms for classification. In this research we implemented seven machine learning algorithms and also"
