  "abstract": "One of the main challenges in children\u2019s speaker verification (C- SV) is the significant change in children\u2019s voices as they grow. In this paper, we propose two approaches to improve age-related robustness in C-SV. We first introduce a Feature Transform Adapter (FTA) module that integrates local patterns into higher- level global representations, reducing overfitting to specific local features and improving the inter-year SV performance of the system. We then employ Synthetic Audio Augmentation (SAA) to increase data diversity and size, thereby improving robust- ness against age-related changes. Since the lack of longitudinal speech datasets makes it difficult to measure age-related robust- ness of C-SV systems, we introduce a longitudinal dataset to assess inter-year verification robustness of C-SV systems. By integrating both of our proposed methods, the average equal error rate was reduced by 19.4%, 13.0%, and 6.1% in the one- year, two-year, and three-year gap inter-year evaluation sets, respectively, compared to the baseline.

INTRODUCTION With the advent of online learning, the number of children us- ing online learning applications has increased exponentially. Speaker verification can enable personalized experiences for children in educational applications, virtual assistants, and in- teractive learning tools by recognizing individual voices. This can enhance engagement and tailor learning materials to each child. The current state of the art speaker verification sys- tems [1\u20134] have achieved significant success on various bench- mark datasets [5\u20138]. While speaker verification for adults has seen significant improvements in accuracy due to large datasets and optimized model architectures, speaker verification for chil- dren faces greater difficulties. The challenges in children speaker verification are more pronounced compared to adults in the following aspects. First, the limited availability of children\u2019s speech datasets makes it difficult for models to reach their full potential, particularly because insufficient data can lead to overfitting, which in turn reduces the model\u2019s robustness. Many studies have addressed * These authors contributed equally to this work. this issue in children\u2019s speaker verification by employing var- ious data augmentation techniques, including SpecAug [9], Speed Perturbation [10], Noise and RIR [11, 12], Voice Con- version [13\u201315], and a combination of several signal processing approaches [16]. Second, the anatomical changes in children\u2019s vocal tracts during growth lead to more pronounced variations in their voices [17\u201319], compared to the relatively stable vocal characteristics of adults [20]. Due to the scarcity of longitudinal speech datasets, research on the impact of age-related changes on the performance of speaker verification systems is limited [21], with a few studies addressing inter-year C-SV. However, un- derstanding and improving age robustness in children\u2019s speaker verification systems is crucial in practical applications because children\u2019s voices can change significantly over short periods, leading to potential degradation in verification accuracy over time. Addressing this issue is essential to ensure consistent and reliable performance of these systems in real-world scenarios where a child may use the verification system over several years. In this paper, we propose techniques to improve the inter- age C-SV through two approaches. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in feature adapters [22, 23], we first pro- pose the Feature Transform Adapter (FTA) which aggregates the original local features at different time scales and resolutions to eliminate disturbances caused by age-related changes in the speaker\u2019s audio characteristics, thereby forming more robust fea- tures. We then present a data augmentation method using HiFi- GAN [24] to generate in-domain synthetic audio from speech spectrograms. Although this approach has been previously ap- plied in other fields [25,26], we have adapted this data augmenta- tion technique for the children SV task. As a final step, we intro- duce a longitudinal children\u2019s speech dataset designed to support the evaluation of age-related speech changes and to advance the development and testing of robust speaker processing systems for children. A comprehensive set of ablation studies is conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. 2. METHOD 2.1. Feature Transform Adapter Different from inter-year speaker verification for adult speech [21] (referred to as cross-age in [21]), age significantly impacts the performance of C-SV systems. In this context, global fea- tures, such as formant distribution [27], refer to the stable and consistent aspects of a speaker\u2019s voice that remain relatively arXiv:2502.10511v1 [eess.AS] 14 Feb 2025"
