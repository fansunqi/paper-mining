  "abstract": "We test and simulate the mesoscopic cracking behavior of specimens made of a standard concrete mixture. To this end, we combine stable wedge-splitting fracture experiments performed during X-ray tomography, their analysis with digital volume correlation providing the full three-dimensional displacement field, and phase-field cohesive fracture modeling. In our computations, we apply the measured boundary conditions and model the actual heterogeneous material structure at the mesoscopic scale. Within the phase-field model, we explicitly distinguish among (thus indi- vidually represent) the mesostructural features of distinct material phases with size above a threshold of 1 mm, while we homogenize pores and finer aggregates below this threshold within the cementitious mortar matrix, with material parameters characterized accordingly. We compare experimental and numerical results in terms of both local and global quantities.

Introduction The macroscopic behavior of concrete is significantly influenced by its highly heterogeneous structure, which is composed of a random distribution of air voids/porous patches and aggregates with varying shapes and sizes, ranging from few tens of microns to few centimeters, embedded in a cementitious mortar matrix [1\u20134]. In this work, we focus on the mesoscale, which we define as the scale at which the aggregates and voids with size above an appropriate threshold are explicitly resolved, while those with size below the threshold are homogenized within the cementitious mortar matrix. Clearly, the choice of the size threshold is to some extent arbitrary and depends on the characteristic length(s) involved in the phenomena of interest. Fracture of concrete is heavily influenced by mesoscopic details, such as the shape and location of aggregates and pores, and its comprehensive prediction at the mesoscale requires the accurate and robust description of complex processes such as crack initiation, propagation, branching, and merging in 3D. For calibration and validation of fracture models, accurate experimental data are of crucial importance [5\u20137]. The most common experimental setups used to study concrete fracture include notched and un-notched three- point bending [8], unconfined uniaxial compression, Brazilian [9], L-shaped panel [10] and double notch tests [11] among others (see [6, 12] and references therein). Traditionally, in such tests pointwise displacements are measured using linear variable displacement transducers and/or extensometers, while force values are delivered by load cells. More recently, these measuring techniques have been increasingly complemented by full-field, non-contact ones such as digital image correlation (DIC), which delivers the full displacement field on a portion of the specimen\u2019s free surface, conveniently treated to create a high-contrast speckle pattern [13\u201315]. During a DIC measurement, digital cameras record images of the region of interest during a mechanical test, then a suitably parameterized transformation is applied to the image of the deformed surface with the aim of recovering the reference image, i.e., that of the undeformed surface. The maximization of a cross-correlation score between reference and deformed images enables \u2217Corresponding author Email address: pcarrara@ethz.ch (P.
