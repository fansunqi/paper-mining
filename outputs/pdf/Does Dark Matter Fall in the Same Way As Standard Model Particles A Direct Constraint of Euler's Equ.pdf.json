Edouard Belin, 31400 Toulouse, France (Dated: February 19, 2025) Since dark matter particles have never been directly detected, we do not know how they move, and in particular we do not know how they fall inside gravitational potential wells. Usually it is assumed that dark matter only interacts gravitationally with itself and with particles of the standard model, and therefore that its motion is governed by Euler\u2019s equation. In this paper, we test this assumption for the first time at cosmological scales, by combining measurements of galaxy velocities with measurements of gravitational potential wells, encoded in the Weyl potential. We find that current data are consistent with Euler\u2019s equation at redshifts z \u2208[0.3, 0.8], and we place constraints on the strength of a potential fifth force, which would alter the way dark matter particles fall. We find that a positive fifth force cannot exceed 7% of the gravitational interaction strength, while a negative fifth force is limited to 21%. The coming generation of surveys, including the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will drastically improve the constraints, allowing to constrain a departure from pure gravitational interaction at the level of 2%. I. INTRODUCTION One of the current main challenges of cosmology and of particle physics is to understand the nature and properties of dark matter. In the simplest model, dark matter is made of cold collisionless particles, which interact only gravitationally with particles of the standard model. This so-called \u201ccold dark matter\u201d feels gravity in the same way as standard matter, i.e., it moves along the same geodesics and obeys Euler\u2019s equation. The existence of such cold dark matter particles is supported by cosmological observations over a wide range of scales, from the motion of stars in galaxies, and that of galaxies in clusters [1], to the large-scale structure of the Universe [2, 3] and the temperature fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [4\u20136]. However, since no direct observation of such a particle has been made yet, it is legitimate to question these assumptions and explore models beyond the cold dark matter paradigm. In particular, it is important to test the validity of Euler\u2019s equation for dark matter to determine if it falls indeed in the same way inside a gravitational potential well as standard matter. A violation of Euler\u2019s equation for dark matter can either be gravitational, i.e., due to a breaking of the weak equivalence principle within gravity, which could couple differently to different types of matter, see e.g., [7]. Or it can be due to non-gravitational dark matter interactions, either with particles of the standard model [8\u201310], with a dark sector, e.g., dark radiation [11, 12] or dark energy [13\u201315], or with themselves [16\u201318]. Such interactions would directly alter the way dark matter particles fall in a gravitational potential and break the validity of Euler\u2019s equation. In this work we focus on the second scenario: we assume that gravity is described by general relativity, which obeys the weak equivalence principle, and we search for deviations in Euler\u2019s equation due to non-gravitational dark matter interactions. Extensive searches for dark matter particles and their (non-gravitational) interactions have been performed via various methods: searches for dark matter collisions with particles of the standard model in Earth-based detectors, called direct search experiments, e.g., [19\u201322]; searches of products of dark matter decays by looking for new signals from the cosmos, called indirect search experiments, e.g., [23, 24]; and searches of dark matter particles in colliders, in particular at the Large Hadron Collider, see [25\u201329]. Since non-gravitational dark matter interactions (if they exist) are believed to be mediated by new particles, colliders are also searching for traces of these new particles, \u2217nastassia.grimm@unige.ch \u2020 camille.bonvin@unige.ch \u2021 isaac.tutusaus@irap.omp.eu arXiv:2502.12843v1 [astro-ph.CO] 18 Feb 2025"
