  "abstract": ". We prove the rationality and irreducibility of the moduli space of mathematical instanton vector bundles of arbitrary rank and charge on P3. In particular, the result applies to the rank-2 case. This problem was \ufb01rst studied by Barth, Hartshorne, Hirschowitz- Narasimhan in the late 1970s. We also show that the mathematical instantons of variable rank and charge form a monoidal category. The proof is based on an in-depth analysis of the Barth-Hulek monad-construction and on a detailed description of the moduli space of (framed and unframed) stable bundles on Hirzebruch surfaces. Introduction The interest in rank-2 instanton bundles on the three-dimensional projective space (with Chern classes c1 \u201c 0, c2 \u201c n) has its origins in the articles of Atiyah et al. [1, 2, 3], Barth- Hulek [4], Drinfel\u2019d-Manin [19], and Hartshorne [25, 27], which in turn were motivated by work of \u2019t Hooft [29] and Polyakov [37]. The geometry of their moduli spaces, such as smoothness and irreducibility, has been intensively investigated: see [26, 5, 18, 38, 13, 32, 40] for the rank-2 case and [11, 12, 23, 33, 34] for generalizations to higher rank bundles on P3. The issue regarding the rationality of the moduli spaces of instanton bundles was raised by Hartshorne [25], and turned out to be a di\ufb03cult problem. So far, it\u2019s known that these varieties are rational for rank-2 and charge n \u201c 2, 4, 5, due to works of Hirschowitz-Narasimhan [28], Ellingsrud-Str\u00f8mme [21], and Katsylo [35]; for n\u011b6, the issue remained open, in spite of recent e\ufb00orts [41, 42]. Beorchia-Franco [8] proved that the moduli space of \u2019tHooft instantons \u2013those which possess a section at the \ufb01rst twist\u2013 is irreducible and rational. Let us emphasize that the techniques are speci\ufb01c to the rank-two case. The goal in here is to address the rationality issue mentioned above in arbitrary rank. Most of the literature is dedicated to the rank-2 case, but non-abelian gauge theories for SUprq are frequent in physics. Also, the ADHM-construction and the Penrose transform relating Hermitian vector bundles with self-dual connections over the sphere S4, on one hand, to certain holomorphic vector bundles on P3, on the other hand, applies in this general setting [1, 2]. For this reason we believe that our uni\ufb01ed treatment of the arbitrary rank case yields additional interest to this article. Let us precise that our de\ufb01nition of mathematical instantons assumes the existence of a trivializing line; rank-2, semi-stable vector bundles with c1 \u201c 0 automatically satisfy this condition. The \ufb01rst, possibly unexpected, result is that the instanton-property of vector bundles (of variable rank and charge) is closed under tensor product. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 14M20, 14D20, 14J60, 14D21.
