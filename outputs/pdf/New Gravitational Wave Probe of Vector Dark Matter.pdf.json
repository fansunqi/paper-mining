  "title": "New Gravitational Wave Probe of Vector Dark Matter.pdf",
  "abstract": "The longitudinal components of massive vector fields generated during inflation constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, with interesting phenomenological implications. Dur- ing the epoch of radiation domination following inflation, their spectrum exhibits a peak at small scales, whose amplitude and position are governed by the parameters of the dark matter model. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum induced at second order in fluctuations by such a longitudinal vector peak. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum can, in principle, reach significant values at nano-Hertz frequen- cies or lower. This result suggests a novel gravitational wave probe to test inflationary vector dark matter scenarios, independent from assumptions on the coupling of dark vectors to the Standard Model. Additionally, we derive new analytical formulas for the longitudinal vector transfer functions during radiation domination, offering a valuable tool for characterising the convolution integrals that govern the properties of the induced gravitational waves. 1 Introduction Determining the nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the most pressing open questions in physics. If DM is a particle, it should couple very feebly to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, as only its gravitational interactions with normal matter have been observed so far [1,2]. It is possible for DM particles to have no gauge interactions at all with the SM; at most, they may have kinetic mixings or interactions with gauge singlets. In this case, we can reveal its presence through so-called DM portals, see e.g. [3,4] for reviews. In this work we discuss a new gravitational wave probe of certain well-motivated models of particle DM. We consider the framework developed in [5] where DM consists of the longitudinal components of a massive dark photon and is produced via gravitational effects during the inflationary epoch. Gravitational production of scalar fields in the context of inflationary scenarios has previously been investigated (see [6\u20138]). Ref. [5] extended these analyses to the spin-1 case, establishing a connection to DM. Specifically, it highlighted the role of the longitudinal component induced by the mass term, whose Lagrangian in a Friedmann\u2013Lema\u02c6\u0131tre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) back- ground was first provided and analysed in [9]. The scenario proposed in [5] has been further 12347066.at.swansea.ac.uk 2marco.peloso.at.infn.it 3g.tasinato2208.at.gmail.com 1 arXiv:2502.13116v1 [astro-ph.CO] 18 Feb 2025"
