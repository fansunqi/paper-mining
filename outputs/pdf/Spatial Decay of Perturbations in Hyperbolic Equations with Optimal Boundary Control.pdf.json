Recently, domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability has been the central as- sumption to ensure robustness in the sense of exponential decay of spatially localized pertur- bations in optimally controlled evolution equations. In the present paper we analyze a chain of transport equations with boundary and point controls with regard to this property. Both for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary and coupling conditions, we show a necessary and sufficient criterion on control domains which allow for the domain-uniform stabilization of this equation. We illustrate the results by means of a numerical example. 1. Introduction Robustness with regard to perturbations is a key issue in finding practicable solutions for the design of controllers which can be applied to real-world systems. In recent years robustness of optimal trajectories has therefore been a major research topic in the context of optimal control for partial differential equations. A manifestation of robustness with respect to perturbation of initial values is the turnpike property, which states that optimal trajectories stay near an optimal steady state for most of the time, see e.g. [2, 10] for nonlinear problems, [1, 7] for PDEs or the overview articles [3, 4]. In [7] it was shown that stabilizability and detectability imply localized sensitivities in time w.r.t. perturbations of the dynamics: temporally localized source terms only have a local effect on the optimal solution. In [9], spatially localized robustness was analyzed for the case of graph-structured NLPs using first- and second-order optimality conditions uniform in the size of the graph. PDEs were considered only recently in [5, 6], where the assumption of domain-uniform stabilizability (and its dual notion of detectability) has been paramount in proving that spatially localized perturbations only cause spatially localized deviations in the behaviour of optimally controlled hyperbolic equations. Loosely speaking, and considering an evolution equation on L2(\u2126), \u2126\u2282Rn with n \u2208N, domain-uniform stabilizability means that for any initial value there is a control such that the resulting state satisfies \u2225x(t)\u2225L2(\u2126) \u2264Me\u2212\u03c9t\u2225x0\u2225L2(\u2126) (1) for constants M \u22651 and \u03c9 > 0 uniform in the size of the spatial domain \u2126. Here, the uniformity of the constants in the domain size is crucial to obtain the exponential spatial decay in optimal solutions by a scaling argument. Domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability was characterized for distributed control of transport equations in [5]. In this paper we extend these results to the case of boundary and point control. We show that the transport equation with boundary control is domain uniformly 1Optimization-based Control Group, Institute of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00a8at Ilmenau (e-mail: {benedikt-florian.oppeneiger, karl.worthmann}@tu-ilmenau.de). 2Faculty of Mathematics, Chemnitz University of Technology (e-mail: manuel.schaller@math.tu-chemnitz.de).
