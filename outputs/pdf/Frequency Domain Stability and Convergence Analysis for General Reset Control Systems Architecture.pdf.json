  "abstract": "\u2014 A key factor that generates significant in- terest in reset control systems, especially within indus- trial contexts, is their potential to be designed using a frequency-domain loop-shaping procedure. On the other hand, formulating and assessing stability analysis for these nonlinear elements often depends on access to parametric models and numerically solving linear matrix inequalities. These specific factors could present challenges to the successful implementation of reset control within industrial settings. Moreover, one of the most effective structures for implementing reset elements is to use them in parallel with a linear element. Therefore, this article presents the development of the frequency domain-based H\u03b2 stability method from a series to a more general structure of reset control systems. Additionally, it investigates the behavior of different reset elements in terms of the feasibility of stability in the presence of time delay. To illustrate the research findings, two examples are provided, including one from an industrial application.

INTRODUCTION R ESET elements are nonlinear filters used to overcome the fundamental performance limitations of linear time- invariant (LTI) control systems [1]. The increasing demand for extremely fast and accurate performance in fields such as precision motion control is pushing linear controllers to their limits [2]. The concept of reset control was initially introduced in [3] as a nonlinear integrator, later known as the Clegg integrator (CI). It demonstrated promising behavior in overcoming the limitations inherent in linear feedback control caused by Bode\u2019s gain-phase relationship [4]. Over time, more advanced reset components were created, including the first- order reset element (FORE) [5], the generalized first-order reset element (GFORE) [6], and the second-order reset element (SORE) [7]. By using the sinusoidal-input describing function (SIDF) method [8], a reset element can be represented in the frequency domain. This allows us to perform frequency domain analysis when a reset element is incorporated with LTI elements in a control loop. Frequency response analysis is a technique This work was supported by ASMPT, 6641 TL Beuningen, The Netherlands. S. Ali Hosseini and S. Hassan HosseinNia are with the Department of Precision and Microsystems Engineering, Delft University of Technol- ogy, 2628 CD Delft, The Netherlands (e-mail: S.A.Hosseini@tudelft.nl; S.H.HosseinNiaKani@tudelft.nl). that is used to assess the magnitude and phase properties of a control system. Thus, a designer can shape and tune the performance of closed-loop systems based on their open-loop analysis, a process known as loop shaping [9]. This design approach enables us to evaluate the closed-loop performance of the control system without developing a parametric model of the plant. Instead, we can use a frequency response function (FRF), which can be derived solely from measurement data [10]. The stability analysis of a reset control system (RCS) is as important as the performance analysis to ensure reliable and predictable operation. To assess the stability of a closed- loop RCS, several methods have been proposed [11]\u2013[17]. These include the reset instants dependent method [11], [12], the quadratic Lyapunov functions method [13]\u2013[15], the small gain, passivity, and IQC approaches [16], [17]. Utilizing these approaches typically requires solving LMIs and deriving a parametric approximation of the plant, both of which are time- consuming processes and introduce uncertainties. Therefore, similar to frequency domain-based performance analysis, a frequency domain-based stability analysis is desired for RCSs. To this respect, some frequency domain-based stability methods are introduced [9], [14], [18]\u2013[21]. In [9], a frequency domain-based stability method was developed for reset control systems, focusing on their input/output behavior. However, this method can be applied when the output is confined to a certain sector bound, as well as when the reset action is only triggered by the zero crossing of the reset element input. In [20], they approximate the scale graph [22] of reset controllers, resulting in a graphical tool to assess the stability of an RCS. However, it is not applicable to the zero-crossing triggered reset elements, which are the most common reset controllers. In [18], [19], the H\u03b2 method was introduced, which includes a strictly positive real condition to guarantee closed-loop stability. It has been proven that an RCS can be quadratically stable if and only if the H\u03b2 condition is satisfied. In fact, the H\u03b2 condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov function [11], [18]. However, in general, this approach still relies on a parametric model to identify both a positive definite matrix and a vector that define the output of a transfer matrix, which must be strictly positive real. Additionally, the method discussed in [18] is limited to RCSs where the error is forced to be the reset-triggered signal, and no pre-filtering of the reset element is possible.
