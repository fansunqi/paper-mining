  "title": "A Variant of \u0160emrl's Preserver Theorem for Singular Matrices.pdf",
  "abstract": ". For positive integers 1 \u010f k \u010f n let Mn be the algebra of all n \u02c6 n complex matrices and M \u010fk n its subset consisting of all matrices of rank at most k. We \ufb01rst show that whenever k \u0105 n 2 , any continuous spectrum-shrinking map \u03c6 : M \u010fk n \u00d1 Mn (i.e. spp\u03c6pXqq \u010e sppXq for all X P M \u010fk n ) either preserves characteristic polynomials or takes only nilpotent values. Moreover, for any k there exists a real analytic embedding of M \u010fk n into the space of n \u02c6 n nilpotent matrices for all su\ufb03ciently large n. This phenomenon cannot occur when \u03c6 is injective and either k \u0105 n \u00b4 ?n or the image of \u03c6 is contained in M \u010fk n . We then establish a main result of the paper \u2013 a variant of \u0160emrl\u2019s preserver theorem for M \u010fk n : if n \u011b 3, any injective continuous map \u03c6 : M \u010fk n \u00d1 M \u010fk n that preserves commutativity and shrinks spectrum is of the form \u03c6p\u00a8q \u201c T p\u00a8qT \u00b41 or \u03c6p\u00a8q \u201c T p\u00a8qtT \u00b41, for some invertible matrix T P Mn. Moreover, when k \u201c n \u00b4 1, which corresponds to the set of singular n \u02c6 n matrices, this result extends to maps \u03c6 which take values in Mn. Finally, we discuss the indispensability of assumptions in our main result. Introduction This is a follow-up on prior work ultimately motivated by the problem of characterizing Jordan morphisms [11, \u00a7I.1] between matrix algebras or more broadly, operator algebras: linear maps satisfying \u03c6pXY ` Y Xq \u201c \u03c6pXq\u03c6pY q ` \u03c6pY q\u03c6pXq, @X, Y. We remind the reader (e.g. [9, 18]) that such nonzero self-maps on the n \u02c6 n complex matrix algebra Mn are classi\ufb01ed as precisely those of the form (0-1) \u03c6p\u00a8q \u201c Tp\u00a8qT \u00b41 or \u03c6p\u00a8q \u201c Tp\u00a8qtT \u00b41, for some invertible matrix T P Mn. The vast literature on Jordan morphisms between operator algebras has branched out in numerous directions and spawned many variations on the theme of recognizing, characterizing and classifying such morphisms via various (linear and nonlinear) preservation properties. One notable example of such a result is the theorem alluded to in the present paper\u2019s title: Theorem A (\u0160emrl\u2019s preserver theorem [19, Theorem 1.1]). Let \u03c6 : Mn \u00d1 Mn, n \u011b 3, be a continuous map that preserves \u201a commutativity, in the sense that @X, Y P Mn : XY \u201c Y X \u00f9\u00f1 \u03c6pXq\u03c6pY q \u201c \u03c6pY q\u03c6pXq; \u201a and also spectra, i.e. spp\u03c6pXqq \u201c sppXq for all X P Mn. Then, there exists an invertible matrix T P Mn such that \u03c6 is as in (0-1). Date: February 3, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 47A10; 47B49; 15A27; 57N35.
