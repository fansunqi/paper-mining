Nondeterministic Behaviours in Double Categorical Systems Theory Paul Zhongpeng Wang Department of Mathematics and Applications \u00b4Ecole Normale Sup\u00b4erieure de Paris Paris, France paul.wang@ens.psl.eu In this paper, we build a double theory capturing the idea of nondeterministic behaviours and trajecto- ries. Following Jaz Myers\u2019 Double Categorical Systems Theory [9], we construct a monoidal double category of systems and interfaces, which then yields (co)representable behaviours. We use condi- tional products in Markov categories to get compositional trajectories and behaviours, and represent nondeterministic systems and lenses using parametric deterministic maps. The resulting theory can also represent imprecise probability via naming Knightian choices, `a la Liell-Cock and Staton [11]. 1 Introduction Compositional modelling is based on the principle that one can, to some extent, represent and understand systems by \ufb01rst decomposing them into subsystems, then aggregating knowledge on the subsystems and their interactions. It is expected to be a useful foundation for collaborative modelling; this principle underpins the projects ModelCollab [12] and CatColab [8]. A potential (still hypothetical at this stage) application of these modelling practices is the training and deployment of safer AI systems [1]. One active avenue of research in this area is based on double category theory. A key idea, as demon- strated in Jaz Myers\u2019 work [9], is that wiring systems together and comparing systems are distinct op- erations, each of which ought to be encoded in a speci\ufb01c category. However, these operations are not independent: some compatibility conditions naturally appear. These observations make double cate- gories relevant to systems theory. Another related motivation for the use of double category theory is categorical logics: as shown by Lambert and Patterson [10], it can be useful to view theories as cartesian double categories. An open question is adapting Double Categorical Systems Theory to nondeterministic settings: al- though [9] contains examples of \u201dnondeterministic systems theories\u201d, there are issues with the notions of trajectories in those. See the discussion in the last three paragraphs of [9, Section 3.5]. Our goal is to answer this question. As a matter of fact, there are already some results on nondeterministic behaviours, for instance in the probabilistic programming semantics literature (see [11] and [7]). Note that these results do not explicitly use the double categorical point of view mentioned above, and do not provide a complete answer. In this work, we construct theories of nondeterministic systems and behaviours that \ufb01t into a double categorical framework. We describe the requirements in 1.1, and give a high-level description of our contributions in 1.2."
