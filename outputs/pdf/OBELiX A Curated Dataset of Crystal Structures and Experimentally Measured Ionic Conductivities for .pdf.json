  "abstract": "Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to re- place liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical en- ergy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower ef- fective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional the- oretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to ex- pedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of \u223c600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room tempera- ture ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is described by their measured com- position, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystal- lographic information file (CIF) is provided for \u223c320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and fea- tures of the dataset and provide training and test- ing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facil- itate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery. *Equal contribution 1Mila, Montr\u00b4eal, Canada 2Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, Montr\u00b4eal, Canada 3Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada 4National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Canada 5D\u00b4epartement d\u2019informatique et de recherche op\u00b4erationnelle, Universit\u00b4e de Montr\u00b4eal, Montr\u00b4eal, Canada.

Introduction Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) used in most consumer elec- tronics and electric vehicles have seen immense progress in terms of energy density, power density, safety and dura- bility. However, their performance is reaching a plateau. Solid-state batteries are regarded as the next generation of batteries that may allow significant improvement over these characteristics (Janek & Zeier, 2016; 2023). The key difference between these two technologies is their elec- trolyte, the medium which allows the transport of ions dur- ing charge and discharge. A solid-state electrolyte (SSE)\u2014 as opposed to a liquid electrolyte in LIBs\u2014permits new de- sign choices that ultimately lead to better battery properties (Betz et al., 2019), let alone the fact that solid electrolytes are not flammable unlike their liquid counterparts. SSEs have a long research history, starting from Faraday\u2019s first discovery of fast ion transport in \u03b2-PbF2 and Ag2S about 200 years ago (Funke, 2013), until the relatively re- cent development of Li-based ionic conductors, such as Li10GeP2S12 (Kamaya et al., 2011). Ionic conductivity (\u03c3), expressed in siemens per centime- ter (S/cm), measures how easily ions can move through a medium or material. Ideal SSEs, also called \u201csuperi- onic\u201d or \u201cfast-ionic\u201d conductors, are electrolytes that ex- hibit ionic conductivity comparable to those observed in liquid electrolytes and molten solids (> 1 mS/cm). Only a limited number of room temperature ideal SSEs are known thus far within a small number of classes of ma- terials such as LISICON (e.g., Li14ZnGe4O16), NASICON (e.g., Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3), garnet (e.g., Li7Li3Zr2O12), perovskite (e.g., Li0.5La0.5TiO3), and argyrodite (e.g., Li6PS5Cl) (Janek & Zeier, 2023). Until now, the discovery of novel SSEs has largely relied on an incremental, experimental approach which consists, for example, of substituting atoms and elements in known compounds. This has allowed the discovery of some highly ion-conductive materials, but greatly limits the search space given that the experimental synthesis and characterization of a new, stable, inorganic solid-state electrolyte is a difficult and costly process that can take months to years (Zhao et al., 1 arXiv:2502.14234v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 20 Feb 2025"
