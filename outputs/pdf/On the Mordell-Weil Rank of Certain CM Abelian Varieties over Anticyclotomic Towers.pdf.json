  "abstract": ". Let K/Q be an imaginary quadratic extension, and let p be an odd prime. In this paper, we investigate the growth of Mordell-Weil ranks of CM abelian varieties associated with Hecke characters over K of in\ufb01nite type (1, 0) along the Zp-anticyclotomic tower of K. Our results cover all decomposition types of p in K. The analytic aspect of our proof is based on our computations of the local and global root numbers of Hecke characters, together with a recent generalization by H. Jia of D. Rohrlich\u2019s result concerning the relation between the vanishing orders of Hecke L-functions and their root numbers. The arithmetic conclusions then follow from the Gross-Zagier formula and the Koly- vagin machinery. Contents 1. Introduction 1 1.1. Previous works 2 1.2. Method of proof 2 1.3.

Introduction Let A be an abelian variety over Q, and let L/Q be a number \ufb01eld. The famous (generalized) Mordell-Weil theorem states that A(L) is a \ufb01nitely generated abelian group. The Z-rank of A(L), known as the Mordell-Weil rank of A over L, is a key invariant of the abelian variety A. In his 1983 ICM report [Maz84], Barry Mazur initiated the study of the growth of the Mordell-Weil rank as L varies along certain towers of number \ufb01elds over Q, focusing on the case where A is an elliptic curve. Let K/Q be an imaginary quadratic extension, and let \u03d5 : A\u00d7 K \u2192C\u00d7 be a unitary anticyclotomic Hecke character of in\ufb01nite type (1, 0). The term \u201canticyclotomic\u201d means \u03d5\u25e6c = \u00af\u03d5, where c denotes the complex conjugation of K. By the work of Hecke and Shimura, one can attach a modular form \u03b8\u03d5 to \u03d5. Furthermore, by the construction of Eichler and Shimura, one can canonically attach an Date: February 19, 2025. 1"
