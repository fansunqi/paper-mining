China (Dated: February 18, 2025) Cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe, unifying our knowledge of cosmology, and potentially unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an im- portant opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) generated by cosmic strings. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguish- ing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. Therefore, we attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji sig- nificantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%. Although our discussion is based solely on simulated data, the relevant methods can provide data-driven analytical capabilities for future observations of SGWB. I. INTRODUCTION The LIGO/Virgo collaboration made a groundbreak- ing announcement with the first direct detection of grav- itational waves, produced by the merger of binary black holes (BBHs) [1]. This discovery not only confirmed Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity but also marked the dawn of gravitational wave astronomy. With con- tinuous advancements in detector sensitivity, the num- ber of observed gravitational wave events has steadily increased. Since the first detection in 2015 (GW150914), ground-based detectors have successfully recorded over 100 events, primarily in the frequency range of tens to hundreds of hertz. However, a significant gap still exists in the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. To fill this gap, space-based gravitational wave detectors like LISA [2], the Taiji program [3], and the TianQin project [4] are being developed, offering new opportunities for low-frequency gravitational wave detection. Space-based detectors are not only capable of detecting a wide range of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events [5], but they also serve as powerful tools for investigat- ing stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) in the millihertz frequency band. The SGWB consists of a superposition of numerous independent gravitational wave signals from various directions in the sky, originat- ing from a variety of sources across the universe. These sources are classified into cosmological and astrophysical categories, spanning different epochs in the history of the universe. The cosmological sources of the SGWB include primor- dial processes in the early universe, such as inflation [6] \u2217cqujinli1983@cqu.edu.cn [7], cosmic strings [8\u201311], and phase transitions [12\u201315]. This paper primarily focuses on the SGWB generated by cosmic strings. The study of SGWB is crucial as it provides unique insights into the early universe, funda- mental physics, and astrophysical populations and pro- cesses. Detecting and characterizing the SGWB can help validate inflation models, explore the physics of the early universe, and illuminate the population and evolution of compact objects over cosmic time [16\u201318]. Due to the inherent noise characteristics of gravita- tional wave detectors [19] [20], particularly the preva- lent foreground noise in space-based detectors, identify- ing gravitational wave signals from the data is a signifi- cant challenge. Traditional signal identification methods, such as Bayesian inference [21] [22] and matched filter- ing [23] [24], have limitations when applied to the detec- tion of SGWB. For example, Bayesian inference requires sufficient prior information, which is difficult to obtain for SGWB, and it involves considerable offline process- ing time. Matched filtering relies on correlating the re- ceived signal with known target templates; however, the stochastic gravitational wave background lacks defined waveform templates. As an alternative, we employ ma- chine learning techniques to identify SGWB, offering a promising approach that complements traditional meth- ods. Machine learning has made significant progress in vari- ous gravitational wave (GW) data analysis tasks, includ- ing GW detection [25\u201328], parameter estimation [29] [30], glitch classification [31\u201333], noise reduction [34] [35], and signal extraction [36\u201339]. In Ref. [40], Zhoujian Cao et al. applied machine learning techniques to identify SGWB within a general model and achieved promising results. In contrast, this study focuses on the SGWB gen- erated by cosmic strings, considering a broader signal-to- arXiv:2502.11804v1 [gr-qc] 17 Feb 2025"
