  "abstract": "We study supersymmetric scale-separated AdS3 \ufb02ux vacua of massive IIA on G2 orbifolds with smeared orientifold planes. We consider two types of T 7/Z3 2 orbifolds which, with appro- priate \ufb02ux choices, yield integer dual dimensions for the operators corresponding to the closed string scalar \ufb01elds in the dual CFT."
