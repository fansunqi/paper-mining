  "abstract": "\u2014Adopting Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as a structured, semantic-oriented, data representation model has significantly improved data integration, reasoning, and querying capabilities across different domains. This is especially true in modern scenarios such as Industry 5.0, in which the integration of data produced by humans, smart devices, and production processes plays a crucial role. However, the management, retrieval, and visualization of data from a KG using formal query languages can be difficult for non-expert users due to their technical complexity, thus limiting their usage inside industrial environments. For this reason, we introduce SparqLLM, a framework that utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, to enhance the querying of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). SparqLLM executes the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to construct KGs from raw data. It also features a natural language interface powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable automatic SPARQL query generation. By integrating template-based meth- ods as retrieved-context for the LLM, SparqLLM enhances query reliability and reduces semantic errors, ensuring more accurate and efficient KG interactions. Moreover, to improve usability, the system incorporates a dynamic visualization dashboard that adapts to the structure of the retrieved data, presenting the query results in an intuitive format. Rigorous experimental evaluations demonstrate that SparqLLM achieves high query accuracy, improved robustness, and user-friendly interaction with KGs, establishing it as a scalable solution to access semantic data.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, the diffusion of digital technologies has led to exponential growth in the amount of data generated and stored worldwide. This is even more evident in the case of Industry 5.0, which shifts toward intelligent, human-centric, and eco-friendly industrial ecosystems. In this novel industrial paradigm, the Internet of Things (IoT) and its evolution, the Internet of Everything (IoE), play a crucial role by supporting the interaction between devices, data, processes, and people, through a highly interconnected environment. The exponential growth of produced data that such an environment can bring, combined with data diversity and heterogeneity, has made data management and integration increasingly complex and prone to errors. Traditional data storage and processing techniques often fall short when dealing with large-scale, unstructured, and multi- source datasets. In addition, the growing demand for real-time insight and decision-making based on integrated data further highlights the limitations of conventional approaches. Address- ing these challenges requires sophisticated methodologies and tools capable of handling the entire data lifecycle of integration and querying. One promising solution is using Knowledge Graphs (KGs, hereafter), which leverage semantic technologies to represent and interconnect data meaningfully. By providing a structured and machine-interpretable representation of information, KGs facilitate seamless data integration, interoperability, and ac- cessibility [1]. However, retrieving dynamic data from such complex models requires expertise in formal query languages, like SPARQL [7], thus heavily limiting their usability for non- technical employees. The integration of KGs with advanced tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs, hereafter) opens new avenues for Natural Language Processing and intelligent data querying. By enabling intuitive and human-friendly interfaces, these technologies fill the gap between raw data and actionable knowledge, allowing users to interact with datasets more effectively [5]. However, the use of KGs in this context presents additional challenges. Existing systems often do not generate precise and efficient SPARQL queries [7]. Another critical aspect when attempting to integrate advanced AI tools with semantic technologies is that such systems are often limited by query hallucination, semantic misalignment, and lack of adaptability to different data sets. Ultimately, this may lead to answers that fall short of user expectations. Moreover, as an additional key challenge, the results of a produced query must be transformed into intuitive, human-readable outputs, without requiring the intervention of technical experts and data analysts. This paper tackles the above issues by developing a com- arXiv:2502.01298v1 [cs.IR] 3 Feb 2025"
