Our analysis follows Lubin (2016) where a messenger civilization follows a beacon strategy we call \u201cintelligent targeting.\u201d We plot the required laser time to achieve an SNR of 10 and find the time for a blind transmission to target all stars in the Milky Way to be achievable for local galactic civilizations. As high cadence and sky coverage is the pathway to enable such a detection, we operate the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) targeting M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) via Las Cumbres Observa- tory\u2019s (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. We explore the ability of modest searches like the LGTS to detect directed pulses in optical and near-infrared wavelengths from Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) at these distances and conclude a civilization utilizing less powerful laser technology than we can construct in this century is readily detectable with the LGTS\u2019s observational capabilities. Data processing of 30,000 LGTS images spanning 5 years is in progress with the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP; Thomas et al. (2025)).

INTRODUCTION The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) seeks to discover extraterrestrial communications based on our understanding of terrestrial technologies and poten- tial future capabilities. Originally, this search focused on radio frequencies, which were well understood as means of communication when SETI efforts began in the 1960s (Tarter (2001)). However, within a year of the discov- ery of lasers, Schwartz & Townes (1961) proposed beam- like signals in optical wavelengths as a means of inter- stellar communication. Indeed, the continually growing power output of laser technology in recent decades sug- gests that lasers may be an effective means of interstellar communication (Howard et al. (2004); Townes (1983)). agthomas@ucsb.edu Thus, examining optical and near-infrared frequencies for laser communications, which few SETI searches have examined (Hippke (2018) and Price et al. (2020)) is a natural extension of SETI efforts. Optical SETI (OSETI) initially focused on systems designed to observe individual stars and detect transient phenomena, such as brief, nanosecond-scale laser pulses, which could indicate technosignals (Beskin et al. (1995); Wright et al. (2001); Howard et al. (2004); Maire et al. (2016)). However, as the likelihood of any given star hosting detectable ETI is small, and since technosignals may not originate from around stars, wide sky coverage is essential to boost the probability of a detection. The first wide-field OSETI survey was the Har- vard/Planetary Society all-sky search which used a 1.8 m optical telescope imaging a 1.6\u00b0 \u00d7 0.2\u00b0 field of view at Oak Ridge Observatory (Howard et al. (2007)). Since arXiv:2501.18903v1 [astro-ph.IM] 31 Jan 2025"
