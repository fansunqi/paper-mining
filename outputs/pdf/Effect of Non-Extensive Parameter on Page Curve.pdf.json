  "abstract": "This work employs the quantum extremal surface framework to compute the Page curve for black holes corrected by non-extensive entropy. The entropy of Hawking radia- tion increases linearly with time, leading to the persistence of the information paradox for non-extensive entropy-corrected black holes. At late time, we extremize the generalized entropy functional; incorporating contributions from both matter and the quantum ex- tremal island, we establish that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation saturates to the non-extensive extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally, we study the dependence of non-extensive parameters on the Page time. 1 ankitanandp94@gmail.com 2 kumar.dinesh@galgotiasuniversity.edu.in 3 24pr0148@iitism.ac.in All Authors Contributed Equally arXiv:2502.00723v1 [hep-th] 2 Feb 2025"
