  "abstract": "Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, es- pecially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks, such as identifying moral- ity frames, make relying solely on human annotators costly, time- consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explana- tions that connect examples to task principles. Our research ex- plores LLMs\u2019 potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a \"think-aloud\" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.

Can LLMs Assist Annotators in Identifying Morality Frames? - Case Study on Vaccination Debate on Social Media. In Proceedings of 17\ud835\udc61\u210eACM Web Science Conference (WebSci\u201925). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX 1 Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic marked an unprecedented moment in global history, not only as a public health crisis but also as a pivotal event in the use of digital platforms. Social media has significantly influenced public discourse, particularly in the context of highly polarized topics such as vaccinations [2, 9, 22, 27, 30, 38, 55, 61, 67, 68, 71] by playing a dual role in both disseminating vital informa- tion [28, 79\u201381] and spreading misinformation [20, 63, 74]. This WebSci\u201925, May 20\u201324,2025, New Brunswick, NJ, USA 2025. ACM ISBN 978-x-xxxx-xxxx-x/YY/MM https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX infodemic [71] has complicated public health efforts, particularly around contentious issues like vaccination, where moral and ethical concerns often influence individual and collective behaviors. Debates about vaccination are often influenced by diverse moral perspectives [3, 6, 30, 64, 76]. Understanding how these moral per- spectives shape public discourse is crucial for designing better tools and interventions in online environments. Morality frame analysis plays a key role in vaccine debates, as it helps to understand how moral beliefs influence individual and public opinions on vacci- nation. It provides a comprehensive framework for capturing the conveyed moral sentiments by identifying the relevant moral foun- dation (MF) [24\u201326] and at a fine-grained level, the moral sentiment expressed towards the entities involved [57, 66]. Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) [25, 26] suggests a theoretical framework for ana- lyzing six moral values (i.e., foundations, each with a positive and a negative polarity) central to human moral sentiment (Table 1). Let\u2019s look into the example text and morality frames: Example 1: Pfizer vaccine testing utilized cell lines from human fetus tissue. This makes it abhorrent, heretical and blasphemous to anyone calling themselves a Christian. Analysis: Morality frame analysis identifies the moral attitudes expressed in the text (degradation), and how different entities men- tioned in it are perceived (\u201cPfizer vaccine\u201d is degrading, \u201cChrist- ian\u201d feels disgusted). Our morality analysis is driven by social science research that highlights the connection between moral foundation preferences and COVID-19 vaccine-related health choices [13, 17, 60]. Pagliaro et al. [60] have demonstrated that the endorsement of moral princi- ples such as fairness and care, as opposed to loyalty and authority, was found to correlate positively with trust in science. For fine- grained morality frame analysis, we employ the recently proposed morality-frame formalism [57, 66] that identifies moral roles as- sociated with moral foundation expressions in text. These roles correspond to actor/target roles and positive or negative po- larity, which can be interpreted in the context of a specific moral foundation. In Example 1, \u201cPfizer vaccine\u201d is the negative actor in the context of degradation which causes disgust among \u201cChristian\u201d (negative target) and the reason stems from the \"use of fetal cell lines in vaccine development, framing this as a violation of sacred values, specifically within the Christian context\". Given the complexity and the psycholinguistic nuances embed- ded in contentious topics, analyzing morality frames poses a sub- stantial challenge, especially in the field of NLP. This challenge arises primarily from three factors. Firstly, the nuances can mani- fest in very different ways depending on context. For example, the concept of loyalty can be discussed in the context of the climate arXiv:2502.01991v2 [cs.CL] 5 Feb 2025"
