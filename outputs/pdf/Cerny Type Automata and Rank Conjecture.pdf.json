  "abstract": ". The aim of this paper is to prove the \u010cern\u00fd conjecture and the rank conjecture for \u010cern\u00fd type automata and monoids. A transformation monoid is said to be \u010cern\u00fd type if it is generated by a simple idempotent and a regular group of permutations. We prove \u010cern\u00fd conjecture for the \u010cern\u00fd type synchronizing automata and the rank conjecture for the \u010cern\u00fd type transformation monoids. In particular, we obtain the tight bound for the reset threshold of \u010cern\u00fd type synchronizing monoids. Keywords: \u010cern\u00fd conjecture, finite automata, transformation monoids. 1. Introduction A finite automaton can be regarded as a transformation monoid with a prescribed set of generators. A finite automaton is synchronizing if its monoid contains a constant map, whose action sends all states to one state. The reset threshold of a synchronizing automaton is the minimum length of its constant maps. Synchronizing automata are most famous due to the \u010cern\u00fd conjecture, according to which a synchronizing n-state automaton has a constant map of length at most (\ud835\udc5b\u22121)2 [1]. Here, we define the reset threshold of a finite transformation monoid, which does not depend from a particular set of generators. We generalize \u010cern\u00fd conjecture to the rank conjecture for transformation monoids and prove it for \u010cern\u00fd type monoids. A similar approach was proposed in [2], where was considered some varieties of monoids and, in fact, was proved the rank conjecture for their rank thresholds. The theory of transformation monoids was developed in [3]. 2. Preliminaries Let \ud835\udc46 be a finite set consisting of \ud835\udc5b states, where \ud835\udc5b> 2. The full transformation monoid End(\ud835\udc46) = {\ud835\udc53 | \ud835\udc53: \ud835\udc46\u27f6\ud835\udc46} on a set \ud835\udc46 is the monoid whose elements are all the mappings from \ud835\udc46 to itself and whose operation is composition."
