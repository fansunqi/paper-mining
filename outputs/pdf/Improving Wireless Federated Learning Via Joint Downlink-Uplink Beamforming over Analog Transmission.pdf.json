  "abstract": "\u2014Federated learning (FL) over wireless networks using analog transmission can ef\ufb01ciently utilize the communication resource but is susceptible to errors caused by noisy wireless links. In this paper, assuming a multi-antenna base station, we jointly design downlink-uplink beamforming to maximize FL training convergence over time-varying wireless channels. We derive the round-trip model updating equation and use it to analyze the FL training convergence to capture the effects of downlink and uplink beamforming and the local model training on the global model update. Aiming to maximize the FL training convergence rate, we propose a low-complexity joint downlink- uplink beamforming (JDUBF) algorithm, which adopts a greedy approach to decompose the multi-round joint optimization and convert it into per-round online joint optimization problems. The per-round problem is further decomposed into three subproblems over a block coordinate descent framework, where we show that each subproblem can be ef\ufb01ciently solved by projected gradient descent with fast closed-form updates. An ef\ufb01cient initialization method that leads to a closed-form initial point is also proposed to accelerate the convergence of JDUBF. Simulation demonstrates that JDUBF substantially outperforms the conventional separate- link beamforming design. I. INTRODUCTION Federated learning (FL) is a widely recognized method to train a machine learning model by multiple collaborating de- vices using their local training datasets [2]. A parameter server (PS) coordinates the devices for local model updates and ag- gregates these updates to perform a global model update. In the wireless environment, the PS is usually hosted by a base station (BS), and FL requires frequent exchange of a large amount of model parameters between the BS and many devices over the wireless links, stressing the limited communication resource, such as transmission bandwidth and power [3]. Furthermore, the \ufb02uctuation of the wireless links and noisy reception at the receivers introduce distortion, resulting in training errors that degrade the FL performance in both training accuracy and convergence rate. Thus, it is crucial to obtain ef\ufb01cient communication design for wireless FL. Many existing communication-ef\ufb01cient wireless FL solutions use digital transmission-then-aggregation schemes for uplink acquisition of local parameters from the devices to BS [4]\u2013 [8]. The transmission and aggregation are designed separately in these schemes. Conventional digital transmission via orthogonal channels is used, which can consume large bandwidth and incur high latency when the number of devices is large. To address this issue, analog transmission-and-aggregation schemes have been proposed and analyzed [9]\u2013[13]. In these schemes, devices simultaneously transmit their local models via analog modulation over the shared multiple access channel, Chong Zhang and Ben Liang are with the Department of ECE, University of Toronto, Canada (e-mail: {chongzhang, liang}@ece.utoronto.ca).

Part of this work was presented in [1]. achieving over-the-air aggregation of local models by superpo- sition. Compared with the digital schemes, such analog schemes can signi\ufb01cantly conserve the communication resource and reduce communication latency. The studies in [9]\u2013[11] focus on uplink aggregation while assuming an error-free downlink. However, it is shown that the downlink transmission can be more vulnerable to communication error than the uplink [12]. Noisy downlink transmission for wireless FL has been studied in [13] by assuming an error-free uplink, where it is shown that, since the gradient descent training method in FL is noise resilient, analog transmission can be more ef\ufb01cient than digital transmission even for the downlink. It is further recognized in [14]\u2013[17] that, especially with analog transmission, downlink and uplink communication for model parameter exchange are coupled during the iterative FL training process. The noise and distortion propagate over the FL communication and computation iterations. This suggests that a joint downlink-uplink design is needed. However, the inter- twined process brings signi\ufb01cant challenges to tractable analysis and design optimization. The literature on joint downlink-uplink communication design for wireless FL is limited. A recent work has studied the effect of noisy downlink and uplink channels on the convergence of FL with non-independent and identically distributed local datasets [14], where a simple generic signal- in-noise receiver model is used to facilitate the analysis. Analog designs have been proposed for noisy downlink and uplink in both single-cell [15], [16] and multi-cell [17] scenarios. However, these schemes only consider single-antenna BSs, and their solutions and convergence analysis cannot be applied to multi-antenna BSs, which are typical in practical wireless systems. For multi-antenna BSs, beamforming is an essential transmis- sion technique that can be applied to enhance communication quality and reduce noise in wireless FL. Receive beamform- ing for uplink analog over-the-air aggregation is considered in [18], [19]. Subsequently, various uplink beamforming de- signs have been proposed for analog schemes to improve the training performance of wireless FL [20]\u2013[25]. These studies consider joint device transmit beamforming and BS receive beamforming. It is shown that carefully designed transmit and receive beamforming schemes can improve uplink over-the-air aggregation. However, the existing literature mostly focus on uplink beamforming design for FL. Our recent work [26] studies downlink beamforming in the context of multi-model FL. As far as we are aware, there is no existing work on joint downlink- uplink beamforming design, which is essential to optimize the overall learning performance. Besides the analog over-the-air aggregation designs men- tioned above, a few recent works have considered digital over- the-air aggregation [27]\u2013[29], where coding schemes with scalar or vector quantization schemes are proposed. These studies focus on how to perform over-the-air computation using digital"
