  "abstract": "This study highlights the critical role of treatment- 16 pausing thresholds in AT for tumors composed of drug-sensit ive and resistant cells. Using a 17 Lotka-Volterra model, the research compares AT with maximu m tolerated dose therapy and inter- 18 mittent therapy, showing that AT\u2019s success largely depends on the threshold at which treatment 19 is paused and resumed, as well as the competition between sen sitive and resistant cells. Three 20 scenarios of comparison between AT and others are identi\u0002ed : uniform-decline, conditional- 21 improve, and uniform-improve, illustrating that optimizi ng the treatment-pausing threshold is cru- 22 cial for AT effectiveness. Tumor composition, including in itial tumor burden and the proportion of 23 resistant cells, in\u0003uences outcomes. Adjusting threshold values enables AT to suppress resis- 24 tant subclones, preserving sensitive cells, ultimately im proving progression-free survival. These 25 \u0002ndings underscore the importance of personalized strateg ies for cancer management and en- 26 hancing long-term therapeutic outcomes. 27 KEYWORDS 28 Adaptive therapy, treatment-holiday threshold, cancer dy namics, mathematical modeling, treat- 29 ment outcomes 30 INTRODUCTION 31 Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide 1, with its biological complexity 32 and heterogeneity posing signi\u0002cant challenges to convent ional therapies such as chemother- 33 apy, radiotherapy, and even immunotherapy 2\u00964 .
