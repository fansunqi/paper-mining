  "abstract": "When used as veri\ufb01ers in Arthur-Merlin systems, two-way quantum \ufb01nite automata can verify membership in all languages with bounded error with double-exponential expected running time, which cannot be achieved by their classical counterparts. We obtain the same result for a\ufb03ne automata with single- exponential expected time. We show that every binary (and r-ary) language is veri\ufb01ed by some two-way a\ufb03ne \ufb01nite automata veri\ufb01ers by presenting two pro- tocols: A weak veri\ufb01cation protocol uses a single a\ufb03ne register and the input is read once; and, a strong veri\ufb01cation protocol uses two a\ufb03ne registers. These results re\ufb02ects the remarkable veri\ufb01cation capabilities of a\ufb03ne \ufb01nite automata. Keywords: A\ufb03ne automata, Arthur-Merlin games, all languages, interactive proof systems 1 Introduction Quantum computation promises signi\ufb01cant computational advantages in many prac- tical tasks (Shor, 1994; Grover, 1997; Peruzzo et al., 2014). In the case of computation with constant memory, it was shown that two-way quantum \ufb01nite automata are more e\ufb03cient and more powerful than their classical counterparts (Freivalds, 1981; Kon- dacs and Watrous, 1997; Ambainis and Watrous, 2002); and, they can solve certain problems using exponentially less memory when reading the input in realtime mode 1"
