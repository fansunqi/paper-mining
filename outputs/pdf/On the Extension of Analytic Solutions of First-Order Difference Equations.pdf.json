  "abstract": ". We will consider first-order difference equations of the form y(z + 1) = \u03bby(z) + a2(z)y(z)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ap(z)y(z)p 1 + b1(z)y(z) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + bq(z)y(z)q , where \u03bb \u2208C \\ {0} and the coefficients aj(z) and bk(z) are meromorphic. When existence of an analytic solution can be proved for large negative values of \u211c(z), the equation determines a unique extension to a global meromorphic solution. In this paper we prove the existence of non-constant meromorphic solutions when the coefficients satisfy |aj(z)| \u2264\u03bd|z| and |bk(z)| \u2264\u03bd|z| for some \u03bd < |\u03bb| in a half-plane. Furthermore, when a solution exists that is analytic for large positive values of \u211c(z), the equation determines a unique extension to a global solution that will generically have algebraic branch points. We analyse a particular constant coefficient equation, y(z + 1) = \u03bby(z) + y(z)2, 0 < \u03bb < 1, and describe in detail the infinitely-sheeted Riemann surface for such a solution. We also describe solutions with natural boundaries found by Mahler. 1. Introduction In this paper we will study the existence of solutions in the complex domain of first-order difference equations of the form (1.1) y(z + 1) = F(z, y(z)), where F(z, y) is a rational function of y with coefficients that are meromorphic functions of z. The existence of meromorphic solutions of the constant coefficient first-order nonlinear difference equation (1.2) y(z + 1) = R(y(z)), where R is a rational function with constant coefficients, has a long history going back to Koenigs [10], Poincar\u00b4e [12], Fatou [3, 4, 5] and Julia [7]. Clearly if y(z) is a meromorphic solution of equation (1.1) then so is (1.3) y(z + p(z)), where p is any entire period one function. It is natural to try to eliminate some of this freedom by restricting the class of solutions of meromorphic solutions of equation (1.1), for example (1.4) y(z) \u2212\u2192\u03b3 as \u211c(z) \u2212\u2192\u2212\u221e. This is only possible if \u03b3 is a fixed point of R, i.e. R(\u03b3) = \u03b3. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 30D35.
