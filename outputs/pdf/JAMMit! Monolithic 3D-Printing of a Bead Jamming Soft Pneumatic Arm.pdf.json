  "title": "JAMMit! Monolithic 3D-Printing of a Bead Jamming Soft Pneumatic Arm.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014 3D-printed bellow soft pneumatic arms are widely adopted for their flexible design, ease of fabrication, and large deformation capabilities. However, their low stiffness limits their real-world applications. Although several methods exist to enhance the stiffness of soft actuators, many involve complex manufacturing processes not in line with modern goals of monolithic and automated additive manufacturing. With its simplicity, bead-jamming represents a simple and effective solution to these challenges. This work introduces a method for monolithic printing of a bellow soft pneumatic arm, integrating a tendon-driven central spine of bowl-shaped beads. We experimentally characterized the arm\u2019s range of motion in both unjammed and jammed states, as well as its stiffness under various actuation and jamming conditions. As a result, we provide an optimal jamming policy as a trade-off between preserving the range of motion and maximizing stiffness. The proposed design was further demonstrated in a switch-toggling task, showing its potential for practical applications. I. INTRODUCTION Soft robots offer a key advantage over traditional rigid robots - their inherent compliance allows safe interaction with unstructured environments and enables adaptation to complex tasks [1], [2]. Pneumatic actuators play a central role in this domain due to their lightweight construction, high power-to-weight ratio, and ease of manufacturing and actua- tion [3]. Recent advancements in 3D printing have enabled the automation of the fabrication of complex actuators and integrated systems, significantly reducing production time and cost while improving precision and repeatability [4]\u2013[7]. However, the selection of commercial soft materials remains limited [8], with elongation at break and actuation pressures significantly lower than traditional silicones, restricting load- bearing capacities and overall stiffness. To address these limitations, designs such as pleated or bellow actuators have been developed, using macroscopic geometric deformations rather than material strain to achieve desired performance [9]. While effective at enabling high deformations at low pressures, these actuators exhibit low stiffness, limiting their ability to exert significant forces or support heavier loads. This constraint restricts their applica- tion in tasks requiring both strength and flexibility. A promising approach to overcoming this challenge are variable stiffness mechanisms [10]. Existing methods, such as tendon-based or pneumatic antagonistic actuation, often *This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Re- search Council (EPSRC) Grant EP/V000748/1 1Yao Yao, Maximilian Westerman, Marco Pontin, Alessandro Albini and Perla Maiolino are with Oxford Robotics Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 2JD, United Kingdom; yao.yao/maximilian.westermann/marco.pontin/ alessandro.albini/perla.maiolino@eng.ox.ac.uk Chamber 1 Chamber 2 Chamber 3 Jamming tendon T Bellow actuator Rigid bead Top plate Bottom plate (a) (b) (c) 300g 300g 5mm 50mm CH1 CH2 CH3 patm p = 20 kPa T = 0 N CH1 CH2 CH3 patm p = 20 kPa T = 25 N 50mm Fig. 1.

Hybrid soft-rigid designs and jamming-based techniques (e.g., granular or fiber jamming) have also been explored [13]\u2013[17]. While these solutions enable stiffness modulation, they often involve complex assembly steps, which prevent monolithic fabrication, require airtight chambers for jamming media, and can lead to uneven stiffness distribution due to media settling under external forces [18]. In this paper, we propose a novel variable stiffness soft pneumatic arm design based on bead jamming.
