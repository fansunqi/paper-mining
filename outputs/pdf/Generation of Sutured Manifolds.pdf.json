  "abstract": "Given a compact, oriented, connected surface F, we show that the set of connected sutured manifolds (M, \u03b3) with R\u00b1(\u03b3) \u223c= F is generated by the product sutured manifold (F, \u2202F)\u00d7[0, 1] through surgery triads. This result has applications in Floer theories of 3\u2013manifolds. The special case when F = D2 or S2 has been a folklore theorem, which has already been used by experts before. 1 Introduction Surgery triad is an important concept in various Floer theories of 3\u2013manifolds. A surgery triad is often associated with exact triangles of Floer homologies, which have been extremely useful in many applications to low-dimensional topol- ogy. One strategy of proving certain isomorphism theorems in Floer theories of 3\u2013 manifolds is to use surgery exact triangles and functoriality to reduce the proof of the general case to checking the isomorphism for manifolds in a generating set. See [6] for an exposition.1 In order to apply this strategy, we often need certain \ufb01nite generation results of 3\u2013manifolds. To explain in detail, we need a few de\ufb01nitions. De\ufb01nition 1.1. A surgery triad is a triple (Y, Y0, Y1) of 3\u2013manifolds, such that there is a framed knot K \u2282Y such that Yi is the i\u2013surgery on K, i = 0, 1. De\ufb01nition 1.2. A set S of 3\u2013manifolds is closed under surgery triads, if when- ever two manifolds in a surgery triad belong to S the third manifold in the triad must also belong to S. De\ufb01nition 1.3. A set S of 3\u2013manifolds is generated by a subset G through surgery triads, if S is the minimal set containing G which is closed under surgery triads. In this case, we also say the elements in S are generated by G through surgery triads. 1The author \ufb01rst learned this strategy from Peter Ozsv\u00b4ath, who had learned it from Tom Mrowka. The \ufb01rst application of this strategy was contained in [2]. 1"
