  "abstract": "We explore the in\ufb02uence of framing on decision-making, where some products are framed (e.g., displayed, recommended, endorsed, or labeled). We introduce a novel choice function that captures observed variations in framed alternatives. Build- ing on this, we conduct a comprehensive revealed preference analysis, employing the concept of frame-dependent utility using both deterministic and probabilistic data. We demonstrate that simple and intuitive behavioral principles characterize our frame-dependent random utility model (FRUM), which o\ufb00ers testable condi- tions even with limited data. Finally, we introduce a parametric model to increase the tractability of FRUM. We also discuss how to recover the choice types in our framework.

Some framing techniques re- frame the same information in di\ufb00erent terms\u2014for instance, describing a product as \u201c25% fat\u201d versus \u201c75% lean\u201d directs consumer attention to distinct aspects, subtly in\ufb02uencing \u2217We thank Jose Apesteguia, Miguel Ballester, Peter Caradonna, Chris Chambers, Kyle Hyndman, Ryo Kambayashi, Kohei Kawaguchi, Jay Lu, Paola Manzini, Marco Mariotti, Francesca Molinari, Hiroki Nishimura, Kota Saito, Ke Shaowei, Chris Turansick, Ece Yegane for their comments. \u2020Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas.
