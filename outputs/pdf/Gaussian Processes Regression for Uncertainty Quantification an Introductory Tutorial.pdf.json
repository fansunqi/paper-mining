  "title": "Gaussian Processes Regression for Uncertainty Quantification an Introductory Tutorial.pdf",
  "abstract": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful method widely used in Uncer- tainty Quanti\ufb01cation (UQ). This tutorial serves as an introductory guide for beginners, aiming to o\ufb00er a structured and accessible overview of GPR\u2019s applications in UQ. We begin with an introduction to UQ and outline its key tasks, including uncertainty prop- agation, risk estimation, optimization under uncertainty, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis. We then introduce Gaussian Processes (GPs) as a surrogate model- ing technique, detailing their formulation, choice of covariance kernels, hyperparameter estimation, and active learning strategies for e\ufb03cient data acquisition. The tutorial further explores how GPR can be applied to di\ufb00erent UQ tasks, including Bayesian quadrature for uncertainty propagation, active learning-based risk estimation, Bayesian optimization for optimization under uncertainty, and surrogate-based sensitivity analy- sis. Throughout, we emphasize how to leverage the unique formulation of GP for these UQ tasks, rather than simply using it as a standard surrogate model. 1 Introduction and background We consider the applications of the Gaussian Process regression (GPR) in the \ufb01eld of uncertainty quanti\ufb01cation (UQ). This work is not meant to provide an exhaustive review of the subject; instead, our aim is to cover the foundational concepts, with a particular focus on beginners. \u2217School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom.
