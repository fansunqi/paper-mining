  "title": "TAP-CAM A Tunable Approximate Matching Engine Based on Ferroelectric Content Addressable Memory.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014Pattern search is crucial in numerous analytic ap- plications for retrieving data entries akin to the query. Content Addressable Memories (CAMs), an in-memory computing fabric, directly compare input queries with stored entries through em- bedded comparison logic, facilitating fast parallel pattern search in memory. While conventional CAM designs offer exact match functionality, they are inadequate for meeting the approximate search needs of emerging data-intensive applications. Some recent CAM designs propose approximate matching functions, but they face limitations such as excessively large cell area or the inability to precisely control the degree of approximation. In this paper, we propose TAP-CAM, a novel ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) based ternary CAM (TCAM) capable of both exact and tunable approximate matching. TAP-CAM employs a compact 2FeFET-2R cell structure as the entry storage unit, and similarities in Hamming distances between input queries and stored entries are measured using an evaluation transistor associated with the matchline of CAM array. The operation, robustness and performance of the proposed design at array level have been discussed and evaluated, respectively. We conduct a case study of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search to benchmark the proposed TAP-CAM at application level. Results demonstrate that compared to 16T CMOS CAM with exact match functional- ity, TAP-CAM achieves a 16.95\u00d7 energy improvement, along with a 3.06% accuracy enhancement. Compared to 2FeFET TCAM with approximate match functionality, TAP-CAM achieves a 6.78\u00d7 energy improvement. I. INTRODUCTION In the era of advancing artificial intelligence, the computa- tional demands on AI models are rapidly increasing. Training data volumes across various domains like computer vision (CV) [1], natural language processing (NLP) [2], and speech recognition [3] have surged, posing significant challenges to computing hardware and architectures, both at the edge and in data centers. The traditional von Neumann architecture, with its constant data movement between memory and pro- cessing units, exacerbates energy consumption and latency issues, intensifying the \u201cMemory Wall\u201d problem. To tackle this challenge, emerging computing paradigms, notably In- Memory Computing (IMC), have gained attention. IMC di- rectly employs parallel data operations within the memory, enhancing core performance and efficiency while alleviating the \u201cMemory Wall\u201d problem [4]\u2013[9]. Content Addressable Memory (CAM) emerges as a hard- ware solution of IMC, enabling parallel and efficient search- ing and similarity measurement within the memory. CAMs compare input data with all stored data simultaneously, and output the stored entry that matches with input or has the highest similarity to the input. Therefore, CAMs are viewed as a potential solution for accelerating various data-centric work- loads like bioinformatics [10], [11], machine learning [12]\u2013 [14], and neural language processing [2]. Specifically, CAMs significantly speed up Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), making this brain-inspired computing paradigm efficient for tasks like image classification and speech recognition [15]\u2013 [17]. This effectiveness arises from CAMs\u2019 ability to transform sequential pattern matching into highly parallelizable compu- tational tasks and simplify the complex distance measurements into Hamming distance [18]. The rapid search and matching capability of CAMs make them essential components in ap- plications requiring efficient data access and retrieval. Conventional CMOS based CAM design consists of 10-16 transistors per cell, which results in large area overhead and high energy consumption [19]. To tackle the area and energy challenges, researchers have proposed utilizing emerging non- volatile memory (NVM) devices to construct more compact and efficient CAM designs, as these CAMs merge the storage and logic within the NVM devices, thus offering significant area and energy saving. CAMs based on 2-terminal NVMs like resistive RAM (RRAM) [20], [21], magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) [22], [23], phase change memory (PCM) [24], and 3-terminal ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) [25]\u2013[33] have been explored. Among these devices, FeFETs stand out in constructing the compact and efficient CAM designs due to their unique hysteresis I-V characteristics, high current ON/OFF ratio, high off-state resistance, low write energy, and compatibility with CMOS technology [34]. While non-volatile storage can achieve high area efficiency and mitigate the high energy consumption caused by CMOS technology, these CAMs still encounter limitations for data- arXiv:2502.05787v1 [cs.ET] 9 Feb 2025"
