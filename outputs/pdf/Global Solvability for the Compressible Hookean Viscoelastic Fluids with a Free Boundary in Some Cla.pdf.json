  "abstract": "Recently Jiang\u2013Jiang established a global (in time) existence result for unique strong solutions of the two-dimensional (2D) free-boundary problem of an incompressible Hookean viscoelastic \ufb02uid, the rest state of which is de\ufb01ned in a slab, in some classes of large data [28]. In particular, Jiang\u2013 Jiang\u2019s mathematical result shows that, if the initial free boundary is \ufb02at, the way the elastic deformation under the large elasticity coe\ufb03cient \u03ba acts on the free boundary prevents the natural tendency of the \ufb02uid to form singularities, even when the initial velocity is properly large. However it is not clear whether their result can be extended to the corresponding 3D case. In this paper, we further \ufb01nd a similar result in the 3D strati\ufb01ed (immiscible) compressible Hookean viscoelastic \ufb02uids in an in\ufb01nite slab with two restrictive conditions: that the elasticity coe\ufb03cients of two \ufb02uids are equal, and that the initial density functions satisfy the asymptotic stability condition in Lagrangian coordinates. These two restrictive conditions in the compressible case contribute us to avoid the essential obstacles that would be faced in the extension of Jiang\u2013Jiang\u2019s result from two dimensions to our 3D case. In addition, we can further obtain a new result regarding the vanishing phenomena of the nonlinear interactions of solutions with the \ufb01xed initial velocity and the initial zero perturbation deformation. Such a new result roughly presents that the solutions of the problem considered by us can be approximated by the ones of a linear problem for su\ufb03ciently large \u03ba.

Introduction Viscoelastic materials include a wide range of \ufb02uids with elastic properties, as well as solids with \ufb02uid properties. The models of viscoelastic \ufb02uids formulated by Oldroyd, in particular the classical Oldroyd-B model, have been studied by many authors. In this paper, we consider the following incompressible Oldroyd model which includes a viscous stress component and a stress component for a neo-Hookean solid [13, 44]: \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u03c1vt + div (\u03c1v) = 0, \u03c1vt + \u03c1v \u00b7 \u2207v + divS(\u03c1, v, U) = 0, Ut + v \u00b7 \u2207U = \u2207vU, (1.1) \u2217Corresponding author.
