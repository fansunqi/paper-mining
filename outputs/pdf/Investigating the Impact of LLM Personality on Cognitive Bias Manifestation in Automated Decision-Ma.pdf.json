  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increas- ingly used in decision-making, yet their suscep- tibility to cognitive biases remains a pressing challenge. This study explores how personal- ity traits influence these biases and evaluates the effectiveness of mitigation strategies across various model architectures. Our findings iden- tify six prevalent cognitive biases, while the sunk cost and group attribution biases exhibit minimal impact. Personality traits play a cru- cial role in either amplifying or reducing biases, significantly affecting how LLMs respond to debiasing techniques. Notably, Conscientious- ness and Agreeableness may generally enhance the efficacy of bias mitigation strategies, sug- gesting that LLMs exhibiting these traits are more receptive to corrective measures. These findings address the importance of personality- driven bias dynamics and highlight the need for targeted mitigation approaches to improve fairness and reliability in AI-assisted decision- making. 1 Introduction The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed decision-making processes across di- verse domains, from education and finance to healthcare and policy. As these models increas- ingly take on roles traditionally held by human experts, concerns about their susceptibility to cog- nitive biases have grown (Hager et al., 2024; Li et al., 2022). While prior research has explored biases in AI-driven decision-making, a critical yet understudied factor is the role of LLM personality in shaping these biases. Emerging evidence sug- gests that LLMs, much like humans, can exhibit distinct personality traits that influence how they process information, assess uncertainty, and gener- ate recommendations (Chen et al., 2024a; Liu and He, 2024). This raises an urgent question: Do LLM personalities amplify or mitigate cognitive biases in decision-making? Addressing this question is es- sential for ensuring that AI-assisted tasks remains reliable and free from unintended distortions. This open challenge, illustrated in Figure 1, motivates our evaluation study on LLM reported here. 1.1 Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making Cognitive biases are systematic deviations from ra- tional judgment that significantly influence human judgments and decision-making outcomes (Kah- neman, 2003; Liu, 2023). Extensive research in Psychology and Behavioral Economics has identi- fied numerous such biases across varying decision settings, such as anchoring bias, confirmation bias, decoy effect, and framing effect, which affect how individuals process information, perceive available options, assess utility and make choices (Benartzi and Thaler, 2007; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). For instance, the anchoring bias leads people to rely heavily on the first piece of information en- countered when making decisions (Furnham and Boo, 2011), while the decoy effect occurs when the presence of an asymmetrically dominated option influences a person\u2019s preference between two other choices, often leading to irrational decisions (Chen et al., 2024b; Wedell and Pettibone, 1996). These biases can result in suboptimal decisions and biased judgments across critical contexts, from financial investments to healthcare choices. Beyond tradi- tional decision-making scenarios, researchers also found that users\u2019 cognitive biases affect their in- teractions with interactive information systems of varying modalities and shape their judgments on re- trieved and generated information (e.g. Liu, 2023; Ji et al., 2024; Azzopardi, 2021; Lin and Ng, 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Wang and Liu, 2023). 1.2 Personality Traits and Cognitive Biases Personality traits significantly affect the manifes- tation of cognitive biases in decision-making (Ish- faq et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2023).
