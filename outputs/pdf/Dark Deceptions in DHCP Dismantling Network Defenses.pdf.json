  "abstract": "\u2014This paper explores vulnerabilities in the Dynamic Host Con\ufb01guration Protocol (DHCP) and their implications on the Con\ufb01dentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. Through an analysis of various attacks, including DHCP Starvation, Rogue DHCP Servers, Replay Attacks, and TunnelVision exploits, the paper provides a taxonomic classi\ufb01cation of threats, assesses risks, and proposes appropriate controls. The discussion also highlights the dangers of VPN decloaking through DHCP exploits and under- scores the importance of safeguarding network infras- tructures. By bringing awareness to the TunnelVision exploit, this paper aims to mitigate risks associated with these prevalent vulnerabilities.

INTRODUCTION Dynamic Host Con\ufb01guration Protocol (DHCP) plays a pivotal role in modern network management by automating the allocation of IP addresses to devices. However, its simplicity also makes it a prime target for attackers seeking to disrupt network operations. This paper will explore the vulnerabili- ties inherent in DHCP, focusing speci\ufb01cally on the TunnelVision exploit (CVE-2024-3661) and its pro- found implications on VPN security. By detailing these attacks and classifying their risks, we aim to highlight how they affect the Con\ufb01dentiality, In- tegrity, and Availability (CIA) triad, a fundamental framework for assessing the security of information systems. With a clear understanding of the signi\ufb01cance and vulnerabilities of DHCP, it is crucial to delve deeper into the background of the protocol itself, particularly how it interacts with the core principles of network security. A. Thesis Despite its widespread adoption, DHCP remains vulnerable to several forms of attack, some of which can undermine even the most secure systems. The TunnelVision exploit, for instance, demonstrates how DHCP can be weaponized to bypass VPN se- curity protocols, exposing sensitive data. This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of such vulner- abilities, focusing on their potential to compromise the CIA triad and offering practical solutions for mitigation. Building on this perspective, it is important to explore why these vulnerabilities have far-reaching implications for network security, especially in rela- tion to the Con\ufb01dentiality, Integrity, and Availability of systems. B. Justi\ufb01cation The existence of DHCP vulnerabilities poses sig- ni\ufb01cant risks to network security. Attacks targeting DHCP often occur covertly, leaving networks dis- combobulated and users precariously exposed. By highlighting these vulnerabilities, this paper aims to obviate their impacts and promulgate awareness. Given the gravity of these threats, it becomes evident that a comprehensive analysis of speci\ufb01c DHCP attack types is necessary to fully grasp the risks and the corresponding solutions."
