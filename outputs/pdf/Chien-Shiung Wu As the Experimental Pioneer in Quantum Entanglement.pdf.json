  "abstract": "Chen Ning Yang, we review the early pioneering work by Chien-Shiung Wu on entangled photons created from the electron-positron annihilation. This paper formed a basis of the author\u2019s speech at International Symposium Commemorating 110th Birth Anniversary of Chien-Shiung Wu, and of a few articles on the subject in Chinese. 1. Early research experiences of C. S. Wu From 1930 to 1934, Chien-Shiung Wu received her undergraduate education in Central University (renamed Nanjing University in 1949), located at Nanjing, then capital of China. Her thesis was on testing the Bragg equation of x ray di\ufb00raction in a crystal, under the supervision of Shih-Yuana Sze (1908-2007), who in 1933 became a professor and the head of the physics department at this university, having obtained his D. Sci under the supervision of Madam Curie in 1933, working on nuclear spectroscopy. After graduation, Wu worked in Zhejiang University at Hangzhou for a year as a teaching assistant, before joining Institute for Physics, Academia Sinica, then at Shanghai, where she worked on spectroscopy of gases with Z. W. Ku, who had re- ceived her PhD under the supervision of D. M. Dennison at University of Michigan, supported by Levi Barbour Scholarship. In a year, likely with the recommendation of Ku, Wu prepared to go to University of Michigan for graduate study with self support provided by her uncle. En route, in visiting Physics Department of the University of California at Berkely, she was impressed by this department, espe- cially the cyclotron, invented by Ernest Lawrence. Besides, she also heard of some disadvantages in the University of Michigan, including the discrimination against women as well as the prospective of socializing mainly with fellow Chinese students as there are hundreds of Chinese students there, she decided to remain in Berkeley for her graduate study, and she succeeded.1 From 1936 to 1940, Chien-Shiung Wu did her PhD in Berkeley.1 Her research started in 1938, with Ernest Lawrence and Emilio Segre as her advisors. Wu was the \ufb01rst student of Segre in USA. Her \ufb01rst experiment, in 1938, supervised by Lawrence, was on the x rays excited by electrons from beta decay of the radioactive lead. Starting in 1939, supervised by Segre, Wu worked on the products of uranium 1"
