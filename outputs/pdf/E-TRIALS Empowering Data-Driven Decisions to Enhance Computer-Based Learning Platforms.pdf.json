  "abstract": "Heffernan Worcester Polytechnic Institute Worcester, MA, USA nth@wpi.edu Johann Gagnon-Bartsch University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI, USA johanngb@umich.edu Computer-based learning platforms (CBLPs) have become a common medium in schools, transferring how students learn and interact with education content. A recent report by the Institute of Education Sciences revealed that 94% of public schools now provide a computer for every student. The high percentage of students having their own computers highlights the need for researchers to investigate how students learn in CBLPs and identify instructional designs that can enhance their performance. In this paper, we introduce E- TRIALS, a tool by ASSISTments designed to conduct experiments and analyze student performance. Using data from three experiments, we propose a generalizable approach for analyzing experimental data and mod- eling results. We evaluate three Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators: Student\u2019s t-test \u02c6\u03c4t\u2212test, Ordi- nary Least Squares regression \u02c6\u03c4OLS, and Leave-One-Out Potential outcomes (LOOP) \u02c6\u03c4LOOP . Our approach can be used for future E-TRIALS experiments. Code used for this work is available at https://osf.io/xp6ch/.

INTRODUCTION In 1923, Thomas Edison predicted that motion pictures would revolutionize the education system within 20 years by replacing teachers and textbooks entirely (Salisbury, 1986).
