  "abstract": "Algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in large state spaces crucially rely on supervised learning subroutines to estimate objects such as value functions or transition probabilities. Since only the sim- plest supervised learning problems can be solved provably and e\ufb03ciently, practical performance of an RL algorithm depends on which of these supervised learning \u201coracles\u201d it assumes access to (and how they are implemented). But which oracles are better or worse? Is there a minimal oracle? In this work, we clarify the impact of the choice of supervised learning oracle on the computational complexity of RL, as quanti\ufb01ed by the oracle strength. First, for the task of reward-free exploration in Block MDPs in the standard episodic access model\u2014a ubiquitous setting for RL with function approximation\u2014we identify two-context regression as a minimal oracle, i.e. an oracle that is both neces- sary and su\ufb03cient (under a mild regularity assumption). Second, we identify one-context regression as a near-minimal oracle in the stronger reset access model, establishing a provable computational bene\ufb01t of resets in the process. Third, we broaden our focus to Low-Rank MDPs, where we give cryptographic evidence that the analogous oracle from the Block MDP setting is insu\ufb03cient. \u2217Email: drohatgi@mit.edu.
