  "abstract": "Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave exci- tation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomo- geneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the pres- ence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed. Keywords: Solar corona; Solar coronal radio emission; Radio bursts 1. INTRODUCTION Radio emissions from the Sun are not only produced by incoherent processes of energetic electrons, but also via coherent processes involving kinetic instabilities of wave-particle, wave-wave interactions (Melrose 1991, 2017). Solar radio emission is, hence, the most suitable object to diagnose the physical state, acceleration and propagation processes of high-energy electrons in plasmas of solar activity. The solar radio emission mechanism, especially the coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts (Dulk 1985), is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in the solar physics. There has been a constant controversy between the two types of coherent emission mechanisms, i.e., \u201dthe plasma emission\u201d (Ginzburg & Zhelezniakov 1958; Melrose 1970a,b; Zheleznyakov & Zaitsev 1970a,b) and \u201dthe electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission\u201d (Twiss 1958; Schneider 1959; Gaponov 1959), for the mechanism of solar radio bursts since a long time. For reviews, see, e.g., Aschwanden 2005; Melrose 2017. Due to the kinetic nature of coherent radio emissions, fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) numerical simulation has been widely applied to figure out mechanism of coherent radio emission from different space plasmas. For instance, Kasaba et al. 2001; Rhee et al. 2009; Umeda 2010; Thurgood & Tsiklauri 2015; Henri et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2022; Ni et al. 2020 investigated the excitation process of electromagnetic waves by the plasma emission mechanism in weakly magnetized plasmas with \u03c9ce < \u03c9pe, where \u03c9ce and \u03c9pe are the electron gyrofrequency and electron plasma frequency, respectively.
