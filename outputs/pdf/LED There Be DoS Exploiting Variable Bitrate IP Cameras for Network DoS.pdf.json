  "abstract": "Variable-bitrate video streaming is ubiquitous in video surveillance and CCTV, enabling high-quality video streaming while conserving network bandwidth. However, as the name suggests, variable- bitrate IP cameras can generate sharp traffic spikes depending on the dynamics of the visual input. In this paper, we show that the effectiveness of video compression can be reduced by up to 6\u00d7 using a simple laser LED pointing at a variable-bitrate IP camera, forcing the camera to generate excessive network traffic. Experiments with IP cameras connected to wired and wireless networks indicate that a laser attack on a single camera can cause significant packet loss in systems sharing the network with the camera and reduce the available bandwidth of a shared network link by 90%. This attack represents a new class of cyber-physical attacks that manipulate variable bitrate devices through changes in the physical environment without a digital presence on the device or on the network. We also analyze the broader view of multidimensional cyberattacks that involve both the physical and digital realms and present a taxonomy that categorizes attacks based on their direction of influence (physical-to-digital or digital-to-physical) and their method of operation (environment-driven or device-driven), highlighting multiple areas for future research. 1 Introduction Video streaming cameras are an integral part of modern life. Scattered across cities [1], office buildings [2], transportation hubs [3], and critical facilities [4], they monitor the environment for hazards, suspicious activities, quality control, etc. In the past, such cameras relied on dedicated CCTV infrastructure, using specialized equipment and coaxial cabling. However, modern surveillance cameras are network-connected, embracing IP-based technologies. While the adoption of IP-based technologies has increased efficiency and reduced costs by allowing cameras to connect to existing IP networks, it has also introduced security problems inherent to IP networks [5]. IP cameras first compress the raw video using codecs like H.264, AV1, or H.265 to reduce data size. The compressed video payload is then encapsulated with protocol headers, such as RTP (for streaming), and transport-layer headers (typically UDP), followed by IP headers [6]. Transmitting full high-resolution frames at high frequencies (e.g., 30 or 60 frames per second (FPS)) for a static scene is wasteful. In addition to compressing individual frames, video codecs in IP cameras reduce bandwidth usage by transmitting mainly the changes in the captured scene [7]. Modern surveillance cameras operate under the assumption that the scene they capture remains mostly static over time. A high-definition (HD) IP camera would typically produce 1.5-3.0 Mbps for effective surveillance and object detection [8, 9]. In a typical office environment, we observed around 2-2.5 Mbps of traffic generated by a full HD camera with a 60 FPS stream using H.265 encoding. The assumption of scene stationarity fundamentally shapes network architecture and bandwidth planning. An attack we investigate in this paper challenges this assumption. By introducing rapid changes to the scene viewed by the camera, an attacker can force the camera to generate excessive network traffic. We explore a setup where an attacker uses a flickering laser diode to generate rapid changes in the scene. We evaluate the attack in laboratory settings and show that it can increase the bandwidth consumption of a camera by a factor of 5 \u22126\u00d7 arXiv:2502.03177v1 [cs.CR] 5 Feb 2025"
