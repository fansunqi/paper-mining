  "abstract": "\u2014Laplacian dynamics on a signless graph char- acterize a class of linear interactions, where pairwise co- operative interactions between all agents lead to the con- vergence to a common state. On a structurally balanced signed graph, the agents converge to values of the same magnitude but opposite signs (bipartite consensus), as illustrated by the well-known Alta\ufb01ni model. These interac- tions have been modeled using traditional graphs, where the relationships between agents are always pairwise. In comparison, higher-order networks (such as hypergraphs), offer the possibility to capture more complex, group-wise interactions among agents. This raises a natural ques- tion: can collective behavior be analyzed by using hyper- graphs? The answer is af\ufb01rmative. In this paper, higher- order Laplacian dynamics on signless hypergraphs are \ufb01rst introduced and various collective convergence behaviors are investigated, in the framework of homogeneous and non-homogeneous polynomial systems. Furthermore, by employing gauge transformations and leveraging tensor similarities, we extend these dynamics to signed hyper- graphs, drawing parallels to the Alta\ufb01ni model. Moreover, we explore non-polynomial interaction functions within this framework. The theoretical results are demonstrated through several numerical examples.

In addition, Laplacian dynamics have attracted the attention of researchers among different disciplines due to their potential application in biology [2], [3], social sciences [4], [5] and con- trol engineering [6]\u2013[9]. Particularly relevant for this work are, for example, [10]\u2013[14] that have focused on the convergence of systems through cooperative interactions. Networks are generally represented using either signless or signed graphs. In a signless graph where the weight of each edge is nonnegative, Laplacian dynamics typically describe cooperative interactions, leading to a state where all agents converge to a common identical value. However, in a signed graph, where edges can have both positive and negative weights, Laplacian dynamics result in more complex collec- tive behaviors [15]\u2013[18]. Researchers have taken antagonistic interactions into account and showed convergence behavior on a signed network. One of the most well-known models in this context is Alta\ufb01ni\u2019s model [19], which shows that all agents reach bipartite consensus; to be more precise, all agents converge to a value the same in modulus but different in signs if and only if the underlying signed network is structurally balanced. Otherwise, all agents converge to zero. Developing upon Alta\ufb01ni\u2019s model, [20]\u2013[23], have further extended it, in discrete time and continuous time, respectively, into the time-varying digraph case. While Alta\ufb01ni\u2019s model adopts the de\ufb01nition of Laplacian L = [\u2113ik] as: \u2113ik = (P j\u2208adj(i) |aij| k = i \u2212aik k \u0338= i ; some other researchers let \u2113ii = P j\u2208adj(i) aij instead. It has been shown that the latter de\ufb01nition leads to more complicated system behaviors (convergence, clustering, divergence) [16]. So far, all the aforementioned works are based on a con- ventional network and all interactions between agents are pairwise. However, in reality, the interactions are not always pairwise. For example, in social networks, people commu- nicate with each other not only via one-on-one private chat but also via group chat [24]. In ecology, the in\ufb02uence of one species on another is usually correlated to a third species [25], [26]. All these facts lead to a need for higher-order interactions (HOIs), which can be captured by higher-order networks [27]"
