  "abstract": ". In this paper, we study the slow patterns of multilayer dislocation dynamics modeled by a multiscale parabolic equation in the half-plane coupled with a dynamic boundary condition on the interface. We focus on the in\ufb02uence of bulk dynamics with various relaxation time scales, on the slow motion pattern on the interface governed by an ODE system. Starting from a superposition of N stationary transition layers, at a speci\ufb01c time scale for the interface dynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N explicit transition pro\ufb01les whose centers solve the ODE system with a repulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in the slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen\u2013Cahn equation, where the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk and interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are constructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting behavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane. 1. Introduction In this paper, we study the slow patterns of dislocation dynamics modeled by a multiscale parabolic equation coupled with a dynamic boundary condition. Precisely, we aim to characterize the asymptotic behavior when \u03b5 \u21920+ of the solution u\u03b5 = u\u03b5(x, y, t), x \u2208R, y \u22650, t \u22650, to (1.1) \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u03b5a\u2202tu\u03b5 \u2212\u2206u\u03b5 = 0, y > 0, t > 0, \u03b5\u2202tu\u03b5 \u2212\u2202yu\u03b5 + 1 \u03b5W \u2032(u\u03b5) = 0, y = 0, t > 0, u\u03b5 = u0 \u03b5, t = 0, where a > 0 and W is a multi-well potential.
