  "abstract": ". When James Singer exhibited projective planes for all prime power orders in 1938, he realized these using the trace function of cubic extensions of a finite field and linked trace = 0 to perfect difference sets. In 1993, Cartwright, Mantero, Steger, and Zappa found that this trace function can be used to create a triangle presentation, which determines the structure of an \u02dc A2 building. We demonstrate a new, intrinsic connection between the perfect different sets of Singer and the triangle presentations of Cartwright et al. and show that this connection improves the efficiency of algorithms that generate these triangle presentations.

Subsequently in 1938, Singer realized these projective planes using the trace function of cubic extensions of a finite field and connected trace = 0 to perfect difference sets. Thus he proved one direction of the long-standing prime power conjecture: An integer is the order of a projective plane if and only if it is a prime power. An \u02dcA2 building is a simplicial complex whose vertex links are the incidence graph of a projective plane.
