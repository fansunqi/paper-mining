  "abstract": "\u2014 Koopman operator theory provides a powerful data-driven technique for modeling nonlinear dynamical sys- tems in a linear framework, in comparison to computationally expensive and highly nonlinear physics-based simulations. How- ever, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simula- tion accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magni- tude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.

INTRODUCTION Soft robots, owing to their continuous structure and com- pliant materials, can produce motions that closely mimic biological creatures. For example, a soft robotic arm can per- form dexterous tasks in complex environments and operate more safely alongside humans than their rigid counterparts [1]. As a result, soft robotic arms have been employed in a wide range of applications, including surgery [2], targeted drug delivery [3], industrial tasks [4, 5], and deep sea ex- ploration [6]. Despite of the advantages, it is challenging to model soft robotic arms due to the infinite degrees of freedom (DoFs) in their motions. In particular, the major difficulty is in predicting a soft robotic arm\u2019s dynamics with both high fidelity and high computation efficiency. Most accurate physics-based models for soft robotic arms have high computational costs or nonlinearities that make it difficult to design effective controllers. For example, general models based on continuum mechanics models such as Kirchhoff rod models [7] and Cosserat rod models [8]\u2013 [10] inherently represent the continuous configuration space of the robot, but result in a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that is computationally expensive to solve. Industrial finite element methods have also been employed in the case of control of the end-effector [11]. However, these methods often require high spatial and temporal resolution 1School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85281, USA 2School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85281, USA 3Corresponding author: jiefeng.sun@asu.edu Fig. 1.

Reduced order models are a popular alternative that greatly improves computational speed of forward simulation [12, 13] while preserving accuracy. However, nonlinearities in resulting dynamics pose difficulties for controller design. To improve computational efficiency, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to physics- based models. These methods minimize computational costs by using lightweight learnable operations to approximate the dynamical trajectories of a robot. Deep neural net- works have been shown to be effective [14]\u2013[16]. However, for control tasks, they cannot take advantage of explicit model-based control methods due to their black-box input- output mapping property. In contrast, Koopman operator- based methods attempt to construct globally linear models of nonlinear systems and thus can directly take advantage of well-understood linear control techniques while being computationally efficient[17, 18]. Especially in soft robotics, Koopman-based methods have been effectively used for soft continuum arms [19]\u2013[22]. Koopman operators are well-suited for modeling soft robots, but they require large amounts of data to converge. Although methods exist that identify Koopman operators in the low-data limit [23], in practice, tens of thousands of samples are still needed to construct an accurate model of a soft robot due to its high dimensionality, thus consum- ing a considerable amount of time for a physical robot to explore its configuration space [19]. To address this issue, physics-informed learning methods take advantage of arXiv:2502.00162v1 [cs.RO] 31 Jan 2025"
