  "title": "A Framework to Quantify Adaptation to Multiple Drivers.pdf",
  "abstract": "We develop an analytical framework to assess the adaptations in a coupled ecological-economic system and apply it to a bio-economic model. Our framework allows us to quantify the impact of multiple drivers on a coupled ecological-economic system, while distinguishing between adaptation and sensitivities to positive and negative expo- sures. This distinction allows us to di\ufb00erentiate between drivers that improve and decrease well-being. Our \ufb01ndings provide insight into how to focus resources to counteract negative or enhance positive im- pacts. We apply this framework to a bio-economic model calibrated to the North Sea \ufb02at\ufb01sh \ufb01shery. We quantify the adaptations, sen- sitivities and total impact of \ufb01shers\u2019 pro\ufb01ts to multiple drivers and identify among which of them \ufb01shers adapt the most. This work forms a bridge between the multidisciplinary area of adaptability and the bio-economic modelling domain,increasing the understanding and knowledge regarding the measure of adaptation. \u2217Corresponding author: emily.quiroga-gomez@uni-hamburg.de \u2020benjamin.blanz@uni-hamburg.de 1"
