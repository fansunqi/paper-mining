  "abstract": "Within this study, the influence of the German Information Retrieval community on the retrieval campaigns Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) between 2000 and 2022 was analyzed based on metadata provided by OpenAlex and further metadata extracted with the GRO- BID framework from the publication's full texts. The analysis was conducted at the institutional and researcher levels. It was found that the German IR community, both on the author and institution level, mainly contributed to CLEF. Furthermore, it was shown that productivity follows the assumptions made by Lotka\u2019s Law. Keywords: Scientometric Analysis, Information Retrieval, TREC, CLEF 1 Introduction The scientific field of information retrieval holds international relevance while exhibiting distinctive regional characteristics. This is particularly evident in various evaluation campaigns that have emerged alongside information re- trieval conferences, each regionally themed. Notable examples include TREC, which predominantly focuses on English texts, and CLEF, which emphasizes a multilingual approach to prominent European languages. The NII Testbeds and Community for Information Access Research (NTCIR)1, which specializes in East Asian languages and English, and the Forum for Information Retrieval 1 https://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html, [last accessed: 02.02.2025]"
