  "abstract": "This waveform-selective behavior is integrated with an antenna design to preferentially accept a predetermined incoming waveform while rejecting another waveform at the same frequency. In particular, we report how the waveform-selective antenna performance can be evaluated for diverse incident angles, which is enabled by a measurement method based on a reverberation chamber. This method facilitates variation of the electromagnetic \ufb01elds and modes inside the chamber and mimicking of complicated wireless communication environments through rotation of the internal stirrer. The experimental results verify that our antenna design concept based on waveform-selective metasurfaces can \ufb01lter different signals with a wide range of incident angles, opening the door to utilizing such pulse- width-dependent antennas to suppress electromagnetic noise in more realistic wireless communication environments. Metasurfaces are two-dimensional structures that enable control of electromagnetic waves and related phenomena at will via arti\ufb01cially engineered subwavelength composite unit cells.1\u20134 For instance, metasurfaces readily provide abrupt phase changes for wavefront shaping and beamforming3\u20135 and a high surface impedance for electromagnetic noise sup- pression and antenna performance enhancement.2,6 In partic- ular, superior metasurface performance is attained by using nonlinearity,7 which breaks the constraints imposed by classic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.8,9 For instance, metasur- faces designed with nonlinear circuit elements provide power- dependent beamforming10 and absorption capabilities11,12 and can be exploited as power limiters to prevent the prop- agation of high-power noises only while permitting the propagation of weak communication signals at the same frequency.13\u201315 More importantly, the time-harmonized re- sponse at a \ufb01xed frequency can be broken by using nonlinear- ity within metasurface unit cell design, which provides an ad- ditional degree of freedom to control electromagnetic waves and radio-frequency (RF) communication signals. A series of recent studies reported that metasurfaces, including diode bridges, successfully varied the time-domain response for sig- nals at the same frequency in accordance with the incoming waveform, speci\ufb01cally the incoming pulse width.9,16,17 This waveform-selective response (or pulse-width-dependent re- sponse) has thus far been exploited to address a wide range of issues, including those in signal processing,18 electromagnetic interference,17, sensing19, and limited frequency resources.9 In particular, these waveform-selective metasurfaces play an important role in antenna design19\u201323 to vary the radiation pat- tern and receiving performance without utilizing additional energy resources or frequency changes, thus expanding the design possibility of next-generation wireless communica- tions. However, their performance has thus far only been eval- uated at \ufb01xed incident angles, while the incident angle varies in realistic wireless communication environments. For this Pulse Width SP CW FIG. 1. Conceptual image of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface. The antenna is capable of dis- tinguishing short pulses (SPs) from continuous waves (CWs) even if they enter from various angles. reason, this study reports the performance of a pulse-width- dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasur- face for diverse incident angles (Fig. 1). To facilitate the eval- uation, we propose an experimental approach using a rever- beration chamber, which contains a stirrer to readily change the internal electromagnetic \ufb01eld distribution and mode as well as the angle of the impinging wave. However, unlike ordinary free-space wave measurements, within the reverber- ation chamber, the received signal duration becomes much longer than the pulse width of the generated signal, which requires adjustment of the energy calculation and pulse pe- riod durations in the time domain. By properly considering these two factors, we experimentally verify that the pulse- width-dependent time-varying receiving performance can be obtained for a wide range of incident angles. In this study, the periodic unit cell design shown in Fig. 2a was adopted.17 Our unit cell was composed of a 1.27-mm- thick dielectric substrate (Rogers 3010) and a planar conduct- ing layer with a rectangular slit (5 mm \u00d7 16 mm) and an 18-mm periodicity. Across the slit, a diode bridge (Avago, HSMS-286x series) was connected to fully rectify electric"
