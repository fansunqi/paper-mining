  "abstract": "Space layout design (SLD), occurring in the early stages of the design process, nonetheless influences both the functionality and aesthetics of the ultimate architectural outcome. The complexity of SLD necessitates innovative approaches to efficiently explore vast solution spaces. While image-based generative AI has emerged as a potential solution, they often rely on pixel-based space composition methods that lack intuitive representation of architectural processes. This paper leverages deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), as it offers a procedural approach that intuitively mimics the process of human designers. Effectively using RL for SLD requires an explorative space composing method to generate desirable design solutions. We introduce \"laser-wall\", a novel space partitioning method that conceptualizes walls as emitters of imaginary light beams to partition spaces. This approach bridges vector-based and pixel-based partitioning methods, offering both flexibility and exploratory power in generating diverse layouts. We present two planning strategies: one-shot planning, which generates entire layouts in a single pass, and dynamic planning, which allows for adaptive refinement by continuously transforming laser-walls. Additionally, we introduce on-light and off-light wall transformations for smooth and fast layout refinement, as well as identity-less and identity-full walls for versatile room assignment. We developed SpaceLayoutGym, an open-source OpenAI Gym compatible simulator for generating and evaluating space layouts. The RL agent processes the input design scenarios and generates solutions following a reward function that balances geometrical and topological requirements. Our results demonstrate that the RL-based laser-wall approach can generate diverse and functional space layouts that satisfy both geometric constraints and topological requirements and is architecturally intuitive. Keywords Deep Reinforcement Learning, Space Layout Design, Computational Design 1 Introduction SLD represents a complex optimization problem that permeates various domains of human endeavor. At its core, SLD involves the strategic arrangement of elements within a defined spatial boundary to achieve specific objectives from maximizing usability to ensuring aesthetic harmony. This process necessitates a delicate balance between functional requirements including geometrical constraints, and topological relationships, often leading to the exploration of vast solution spaces in search of optimal configurations (Michalek et al., 2002). SLD challenges span diverse applications, forming the foundation of efficient building design in architecture and influencing residential to complex commercial structures (Chen et al., 2021). Urban planners apply SLD principles to shape city layouts, impacting urban livability and sustainability (Mourshed et al., 2009), while interior designers use arXiv:2502.04407v1 [cs.LG] 6 Feb 2025"
