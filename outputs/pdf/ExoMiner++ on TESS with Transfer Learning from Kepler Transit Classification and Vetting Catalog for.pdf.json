  "title": "ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for.pdf",
  "abstract": "We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner (Val- izadegan et al. 2022) to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS\u2019s noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations Corresponding author: Hamed Valizadegan hamed.valizadegan@nasa.gov arXiv:2502.09790v1 [astro-ph.EP] 13 Feb 2025"
