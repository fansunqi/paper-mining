  "title": "A Fractal Dirac Eigenvalue Problem Spectral Properties and Numerical Examples.pdf",
  "abstract": ". In this paper, we study a Dirac boundary value problem where the operator is considered with a derivative of order \u03b1 \u2208(0, 1], known as the F \u03b1-derivative. We prove some spectral properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and we present numerical examples to demonstrate the practical implications of our approach. 1. Introduction The word fractal derives from the Latin word fractus which means cracked. Fractals exhibit unique geometric properties, showcasing a fractal dimension that surpasses their topological dimension. These intricate structures display self-similarity at varying scales, combining repet- itive and random processes. The intricate nature of fractals poses challenges for conventional calculus methods in calculating derivatives and integrals. The connection between fractal ge- ometry and natural phenomena, as seen in clouds, mountains, and lightning, underscores a complexity that de\ufb01es conventional mathematical frameworks, as highlighted in [16]. More- over, in contrast to Euclidean geometry, determining the size of fractals involves non-trivial considerations for measurements like length, surface area, and volume, as discussed in [3, 13]. Fractals, characterized by intricate patterns, showcase self-similarity and often display di- mensions that are non-integer and complex [15, 17]. The middle-third set of Cantor is one of the most well-known examples of fractals [2]. Fractals are often too irregular to have any smooth di\ufb00erentiable structure de\ufb01ned on them, and this results in delivering the methods and techniques of ordinary calculus as powerless and inapplicable. The techniques and methods to create calculus on the fractal sets and curves are studied in [3, 14, 21]. In recent work, Parvate and Gangal [18, 19] introduced F \u03b1-calculus, a form of Riemannian- like calculus grounded in the fractal subsets of the real line. This calculus is distinguished by its algorithmic simplicity compared to other methods. F \u03b1-calculus is a generalization of the ordinary calculus that addresses the cases where standard calculus is inapplicable. In this calculus, an integral of order \u03b1 \u2208(0, 1] called the F \u03b1-integral is de\ufb01ned which makes it possible to integrate functions with fractal support F of dimension \u03b1. Furthermore, a derivative of order \u03b1 \u2208(0, 1], known as the F \u03b1-derivative, facilitates the di\ufb00erentiation of functions such as the Cantor staircase function and the Weierstrass function. In contrast to the classical fractional derivative, the F \u03b1-derivative aligns the geometrical order of the derivative with the domain of the function\u2019s support, lending it a distinct physical interpretation [6, 20, 22]. Notably, the F \u03b1-derivative is local, which is in contrast to the non- local nature of the classical fractional derivative. This locality is crucial in physics, where all Date: February 18, 2025. Key words and phrases. Fractal calculus, Fractal derivative, Dirac eigenvalue problem, Eigenvalues, Eigenfunc- tions. 1"
