  "title": "Run-and-tumble Particles with 1D Coulomb Interaction the Active Jellium Model and the Non-Reciprocal.pdf",
  "abstract": "We extend this study in two directions. First we consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call \u201dactive jellium\u201d. We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large N, which we analyze in detail. Contrary to the linear potential, there is always a steady-state where the density has a bounded support. However, we find that the model still exhibits transitions between phases with different behaviors of the density at the edges, ranging from a continuous decay to a jump, or even a shock (i.e. a cluster of particles, which manifests as a delta peak in the density). Notably, the interactions forbid a divergent density at the edges, which may occur in the non-interacting case. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the + particles (of velocity +v0) are attracted towards the \u2212particles (of velocity \u2212v0) with a constant force b/N, while the \u2212particles are repelled by the + particles with a force of same amplitude. In order for a stationary state to exist we add a linear confining potential. We derive an explicit expression for the stationary density at large N, which exhibits an explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry with respect to x = 0. This again shows the existence of several phases, which differ by the presence or absence of a shock at x = 0, with one phase even exhibiting a vanishing density on the whole region x > 0. Our analytical results are complemented by numerical simulations for finite N. arXiv:2502.09466v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 13 Feb 2025"
