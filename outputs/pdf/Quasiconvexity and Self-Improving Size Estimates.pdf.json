We show that M\u00fcller\u2019s L log L bound F(Du) \u2a7e0, Du \u2208Lp loc(Rn) =\u21d2F(Du) \u2208L log Lloc(Rn) for F = det and p = n holds for quasiconcave F which are homogeneous of degree p > 1. This contrasts similar Hardy space bounds which hold only for null Lagrangians. Let \u2126\u2282Rn be an open set. Recall that a homeomorphism u \u2208W 1,n loc (\u2126, Rn) is quasiconformal if there is a constant K \u2a7e1 such that |Du| \u2a7dK det Du a.e. in \u2126, (1) where | \u2022 | denotes the operator norm of an matrix. A far reaching result of Gehring [8, 3], states that there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that u \u2208W 1,n+\u03b5 loc (\u2126, Rn) for all \u03b5 \u2208(0, \u03b50) and, in fact, the homeomorphism assumption is not necessary [14]. A remarkable contribution of M\u00fcller [16, 17] provides a stunningly simple explanation for this improvement by proving that if the Jacobian of u is non-negative, it enjoys the surprising higher integrability property det Du \u2208L log Lloc(\u2126). Here we show that only the quasiconcavity property that the determinant enjoys implies the higher integrability, so that the class of nonlinear functions for which this type of surprisingly improved integrability holds is substantially broader: Theorem 1. Let F : Rm\u00d7n \u2192R be quasiconcave and p-homogeneous for p > 1. Then Du \u2208Lp loc(\u2126, Rm\u00d7n) F(Du) \u2a7e0 a.e. ) =\u21d2F(Du) \u2208L log Lloc(\u2126), with the estimate \u2225F(Du)\u2225L log L(\u03c9) \u2a7dc(\u2225Du\u2225Lp(\u02dc\u03c9), \u03c9, \u02dc\u03c9), where \u03c9 \u22d0\u02dc\u03c9 \u22d0\u2126are open sets. Moreover, there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that for all \u03b5 \u2208(0, \u03b50) Du \u2208Lp loc(\u2126, Rm\u00d7n) F(Du) \u2a7ec|Du|p a.e. ) =\u21d2Du \u2208Lp+\u03b5 loc (\u2126) with an analogous estimate. We recall that F is quasiconcave [15] if, for a cube Q \u2282Rn, Q F(D\u03d5) dx \u2a7dF \u0012 Q D\u03d5 dx \u0013 for \u03d5 \u2208C\u221e(Rn, Rm) with Q-periodic D\u03d5. (2) This inequality is a one-sided condition compared with the case of the Jacobian, for which a two-sided condition holds. Indeed, if F = det, then (2) holds with equality as the determinant is a null Lagrangian. Theorem 1 is relevant to understanding concentration e\ufb00ects of weakly convergent sequences in Sobolev spaces: Corollary 2. Let F : Rm\u00d7n \u2192R be quasiconcave and p-homogeneous for p > 1. If a sequence of gradients Duj is bounded in Lp loc(\u2126, Rm\u00d7n) and satis\ufb01es F(Duj) \u2a7e0 a.e. in \u2126, then F(Duj) is locally uniformly integrable in \u2126. If in addition F(Duj) \u2a7ec|Duj|p a.e. in \u2126, then |Duj|p is locally uniformly integrable in \u2126. The result of Theorem 1 is striking when compared to similar Hardy space bounds which hold for signed quantities. It was shown in [4] that if u \u2208W 1,n loc (\u2126, Rn), then det Du \u2208H 1 loc(\u2126); moreover, the Jacobian is essentially the only nonlinearity with this property. 1"
