  "abstract": ". Given a finite volume hyperbolic surface, a fundamental polygon and an oriented closed geodesic, we associate a partial covering of the surface. We prove that given a sequence of collections of oriented closed geodesics equidistributing in the unit tangent bundle then the associated partial coverings also equidistribute. In the case of the modular group, this yields an alternative proof of an equidistribution result due to Duke, Imamo\u00afglu, and T\u00f3th. 1. Introduction The distribution of closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces is a classical and rich topic with connections to ergodic theory [3], [22], [32], the spectral theory of automorphic forms [35], number theory [7], [18], [26] and hyperbolic geometry [12], [13]. In the case of arithmetic quotients the closed geodesics are naturally parametrized by integral indefinite binary quadratic forms and thus in turn by class groups of orders of real quadratic fields [30]. In [9] Duke\u2013 Imamo\u00afglu\u2013T\u00f3th introduced a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold \u0393A\\NA with boundary, associated to (narrow) ideal classes A \u2208Cl+ K of a real quadratic field K. The boundary of this orbifold is given by the corresponding closed geodesic \u2202(\u0393A\\NA) = CA on the modular surface PSL2(Z)\\H. They furthermore proved that the hyperbolic orbifolds associated to genera of the class groups (i.e. cosets of the square subgroups (Cl+ K)2) equidistribute when projected to the modular surface as the discriminant of K tends to infinity. Their proof is spectral in nature and relies on relating the Weyl sums to Fourier coefficients of half-integral weight automorphic forms which have been bounded by Duke [7]. The construction was generalized to Hecke congruence groups of prime level by Peter Humphries and the first named author [17] using geometric coding of closed geodesics and certain refined sparse equidistribution questions were investigated. The proofs in loc. cit. rely on an adelic interpretation of the Weyl sums which are then related to central values via Waldspurger\u2019s formula [33]. In this paper we introduce a new purely geometric construction of the partial coverings associated to closed geodesics alluded to above. The construction generalizes to an arbitrary finite volume hyperbolic surface and our main result (Theorem 1.1) is that the partial coverings cover the hyperbolic surface evenly, in the sense of eq. (1.3), if the corresponding oriented closed geodesics equidistribute in the unit tangent bundle, in the sense of Definition 2.1. In particular, it follows that the equidistribution result of Duke\u2013Imamo\u00afglu\u2013T\u00f3th [9, Thm. 2] is a consequence of the equidistribution result of Duke1 [7] as explained in Remark 1.10 and Section 4.1 below. For an overview of the proof of Theorem 1.1 we refer to Section 1.2 below. 1.1. Statement of results. In order to state our results, we will now give an informal description of the construction of partial coverings obtained by \u201cpainting to the left\u201d of oriented closed geodesics relative to a fixed fundamental polygon. We refer to Section 4 below for details and to Example 4.3 for illustrations of the construction in the case of the (2, 4, 6) triangle group. Let \u0393 \u2264PSL2(R) be a discrete and cofinite subgroup. Consider the associated hyperbolic orbifold Y\u0393 := \u0393\\H and its unit tangent bundle \u0393\\PSL2(R). Here H = {z \u2208C : Im z > 0} 1More precisely, it follows from the extension to genera of the class group and to the unit tangent bundle as in e.g. [11]. 1 arXiv:2502.08472v1 [math.GT] 12 Feb 2025"
