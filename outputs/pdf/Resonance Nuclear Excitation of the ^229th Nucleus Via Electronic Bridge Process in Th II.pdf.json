Flambaum School of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia The 8.4 eV transition in the 229Th nucleus is the basis for a high-precision nuclear clock with exceptional sensitivity to new physics e\ufb00ects. We have identi\ufb01ed several cases in the Th+ ion where electronic excitations closely resonate with the nuclear excitation, with the smallest energy di\ufb00erence being \u2206= \u22120.09 cm\u22121. We investigate the electronic bridge process, in which nuclear excitation is induced via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper selection of laser frequencies can lead to a dramatic enhancement of this e\ufb00ect. Additionally, we show that the interaction with electrons signi\ufb01cantly shortens the lifetime of the nuclear excited state. I. INTRODUCTION It was suggested in Ref.[1] that the 229Th nucleus has a low-energy metastable state. Ref.[2] proposed using the transition between the ground and metastable states as the basis for a nuclear clock. The precision of such a clock in a \u201dstretched\u201d state, with maximal projections of both electronic and nuclear angular momenta, is expected to be very high because, in this state, the electron and nu- clear variables are not entangled [3]. Indeed, in such a state, the nucleus is practically decoupled from external \ufb01elds, such as those produced by blackbody radiation. This leads to a signi\ufb01cant suppression of corresponding systematic e\ufb00ects. On the other hand, the frequency of this transition is highly sensitive to e\ufb00ects of physics beyond the Stan- dard Model, including violations of the Lorentz invari- ance and the Einstein equivalence principle [4], as well as variations in fundamental physical constants [5], such as the \ufb01ne-structure constant \u03b1, quark masses, and the QCD scale \u039bQCD. This sensitivity arises from the very small transition energy (8.4 eV), which is the result of strong cancellations between contributions from strong and electromagnetic nuclear interactions, typically at the MeV scale. This cancellation makes the transition fre- quency extremely sensitive to small changes in these con- tributions caused by variations in fundamental constants. Such variations may result from interactions with scalar or axion dark matter \ufb01elds. Therefore, measuring these variations in clock experiments may provide an e\ufb03cient method for searching for these \ufb01elds [6, 7]. The measurement of the energy of the nuclear clock transition in 229Th has been an ongoing e\ufb00ort for many years (see, e.g., [8\u201310]). Recent advances in laser spectroscopy methods have led to a breakthrough in accuracy[11\u201313]. The transition frequency has been mea- sured to be [12] \u03c9N = 2, 020, 407, 384, 335(2) kHz [13] (67393 cm\u22121) in 229Th atoms embedded in a solid. Even higher accuracy is anticipated in future experiments with 229Th ions [3]. The amplitude of the nuclear M1 transition is sup- pressed by \ufb01ve orders of magnitude compared to typical atomic E1 transitions. However, it is possible to enhance this transition using the electronic bridge (EB) process, where electronic transitions induce nuclear transitions via hyper\ufb01ne interaction (h\ufb01). The EB e\ufb00ect also increases the probability of decay of the nuclear excited state. Cor- responding calculations have been performed for Th II, Th III, and Th IV ions [14\u201321]. Previous EB calculations for the decay [15] and exci- tation [16] of the excited nuclear state in the Th II ion could not provide accurate results due to large errors in the measured value of the nuclear excitation energy and the absence of measurements of the positions of Th II electron energy levels near the nuclear excitation energy. According to theoretical expectations [22], the spacing between electron energy levels in this region is very small, making resonance with the nuclear excitation possible. The aim of this paper is to propose an atomic excita- tion scheme that maximizes the EB e\ufb00ect and to estimate the magnitude of this e\ufb00ect. Additionally, we estimate the impact of the EB process on the decay of the nu- clear excited state. Recent data on the Th II electron spectrum [23] (see Supplemental Material for the most complete data) allow us to identify several cases where a small energy denominator in the EB excitation formula leads to a very large resonance enhancement of the EB e\ufb00ect. The error in the calculated level positions exceeds the very small spacing between the measured electron energy levels in highly excited states. To estimate the EB e\ufb00ects, we adopt a statistical approach (based on the calcula- tions of many possible EB transition probabilities) due to the current lack of information needed to match mea- sured energy levels with calculated electron wave func- tions. Accurate measurements of the magnetic moments and angular momenta of the Th II electron states would assist in the theoretical identi\ufb01cation of the measured levels and improve the accuracy of EB predictions. II. ELECTRONIC BRIDGE FOR NUCLEAR EXCITATION AND DECAY IN TH II We follow the method used in Refs. [16, 21] for the Th II anf Th III ions. The decay of any atomic state with energy En > \u03c9N may include nuclear excitation. Since the nuclear excitation energy \u03c9N = 67393 cm\u22121 lies out-"
