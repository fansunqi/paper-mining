  "title": "Asymptotics for Multiple Q-Orthogonal Polynomials from the RHP.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We deduce the asymptotic behaviour of a broad class of multiple q-orthogonal polynomials as their degree tends to in\ufb01nity. We achieve this by rephrasing multiple q-orthogonal polynomials as part of a solution to a Riemann Hilbert Problem (RHP). In particular, we study multiple q-orthogonal polynomials of the \ufb01rst kind (see [12]), which are Type II orthogonal polynomials with weights given by w1(x) = x\u03b1\u03c9(x)dqx, w2(x) = x\u03b2\u03c9(x)dqx, which satisfy the constraint |\u03c9(q2n) \u22121| = O(q2n), as n \u2192\u221e. Using q-calculus we obtain detailed asymptotics for these polynomials from the RHP. This class of polyno- mials studied was chosen in part due to their connection to the work of [11, 12], concerning the irrationality of \u03b6q(1) and \u03b6q(2). To conduct our asymptotic analysis we will require the following added restrictions on w1(x) and w2(x): \u03b1 /\u2208Z, \u03b2 /\u2208Z and \u03b1 \u0338= \u03b2 mod Z. These restrictions are necessary for the asymptotic analysis but not the statement of multiple q-orthogonal polynomials as solutions to a RHP.

First, we wish to investigate how the theory presented in [7], for q-orthogonal polynomials with a single orthogonality condition, extends to multiple q-orthogonal polynomials. In [7] we were able to determined the strong asymptotics for q-orthogonal polynomials using the RHP and q-calculus. As far as we know, these results are the most accurate description of the asymptotics of q-orthogonal polynomials found in the literature. Interestingly, in [7] we observed that if polynomials P (1) n (x) and P (2) n (x) were such that their weights satis\ufb01ed lim x\u21920 w(1)(x) w(2)(x) = 1, then P (1) n (x) and P (2) n (x) had the same asymptotic behaviour (to second order) as n \u2192\u221e(there are some additional minor details to consider for which the reader can refer to [7]). Note that in the language of [2], 0 is an accumulation point of the q-lattice. In the present paper, we successfully extend the theory presented in [7] to the case of multiple 1"
