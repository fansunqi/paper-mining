In this paper, we prove hybrid subconvexity bounds for GL2 \u00d7 GL2 Rankin\u2013 Selberg L-functions twisted by a primitive Dirichlet character \u03c7 modulo a prime power, in the t and depth aspects. 1. Introduction The subconvexity problem for general L-functions is one of the central questions in analytic number theory and it has many applications in number theory. Let f and g be holomorphic or Maass cusp forms for SL2(Z) with normalized Fourier coe\ufb03cients \u03bbf(n) and \u03bbg(n) respec- tively. Let \u03c7 be a primitive Dirichlet character of prime power conductor p\u03ba with p prime. The GL2 \u00d7 GL2 \u00d7 GL1 Rankin\u2013Selberg L-function is de\ufb01ned by L (s, f \u00d7 g \u00d7 \u03c7) = L(2s, \u03c72) \u221e X n=1 \u03bbf(n)\u03bbg(n)\u03c7(n) ns , for Re(s) > 1. And this L-function has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. The subconvexity problem for GL2 \u00d7 GL2 \u00d7 GL1 L-functions is to obtain a bound of the form L \u00121 2 + it, f \u00d7 g \u00d7 \u03c7 \u0013 \u226a(p\u03ba(|t| + 1))1\u2212\u03b4+\u03b5 with 0 \u2264\u03b4 \u22641. The convexity bounds correspond to the bounds with \u03b4 = 0, which follow from the func- tional equation and the Phragm\u00b4en\u2013Lindel\u00a8of convexity principle. The Lindel\u00a8of hypothesis is the statement with \u03b4 = 1. The literature on the subconvexity problem is rich and the \ufb01rst result can be traced back over 100 years ago. For the GL1 case, Weyl [24] proved a subconvexity bound for Riemann zeta function. Burgess [6] proved a subconvexity bound for Dirichlet L-functions. For GL2 case, see Michel\u2013Venkatesh [21] and the references therein. Many progress on GL3 L-functions has been made in the past ten years (see [3], [17], [19], [20], [11], etc.). Subconvexity for GL2 \u00d7GL2 L-functions have been solved by many number theorists. For the t-aspect, see Bernstein\u2013Reznikov [2], Acharya\u2013Sharma\u2013Singh [1], Blomer\u2013Jana\u2013Nelson [4], Huang\u2013Sun\u2013Zhang [10].
