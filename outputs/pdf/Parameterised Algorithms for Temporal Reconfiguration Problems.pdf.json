  "abstract": "Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporal reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph. We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to an- other, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combina- tion of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Mathematics of computing \u2192Graph algorithms; Theory of com- putation \u2192Parameterized complexity and exact algorithms Keywords and phrases parameterised algorithms, temporal graphs, reconfiguration Funding Tom Davot: Supported by EPSRC grant EP/T004878/1.

Re- cently, reconfiguration versions of classical vertex-selection problems have been studied in static graphs, where the goal is typically to determine whether one valid solution can be transformed into another through a sequence of small modifications [10,28]. Formally, reconfiguration versions of vertex-selection problems in static graphs can be defined as follows. Let \u03a0 be a vertex-selection problem such as Independent Set or Dominating Set. Reconfiguration problems in static graphs are often defined with a starting and end solution S and T respectively. The aim is to determine if there is a sequence of vertex sets starting with S and ending with T such that each is a solution for \u03a0 and consecutive sets are adjacent in the space of solutions. The definition of solution adjacency varies according to model. In the token sliding model, a solution can be seen arXiv:2502.11961v1 [cs.DS] 17 Feb 2025"
