  "abstract": ". In this self-contained short note, we prove that every arithmetic function F : N \u2192C has in\ufb01nitely many Ramanujan coe\ufb03cients G : N \u2192C giving an absolutely convergent Ramanujan expansion for F. This is \u201ccoe\ufb03cients\u2019 coexistence\u201d: the non-uniqueness, once \ufb01xed any F, of these G. They are in\ufb01nitely many ! 1. Introduction. Notations and well-known properties The notation we need soon is for sets of numbers: N def = {1, 2, . . .} are the naturals, i.e., positive integers; while we denote N0 def = {0, 1, 2, . . .} non-negative integers; as usual, C is the set of complex numbers. In the following, for integers d, n with d \u0338= 0 we abbreviate d|n for: d divides n, in other words n is a multiple of d. The set of prime numbers is abbreviated P, while they are denoted as p, with or without subscripts. Two integers are called coprime, by de\ufb01nition, IFF (If and only If) there\u2019s no p dividing both: in other words, their greatest common divisor, g.c.d., is 1. When not explicitly stated otherwise, n \u2264x means n \u22651, too. Ramanujan studied, in the history-making paper [R], the Ramanujan Sum with modulus q & argument a : \u2200q \u2208N, \u2200a \u2208Z, cq(a) def = X j\u2264q (j,q)=1 cos 2\u03c0ja q , where (j, q) abbreviates the g.c.d. of j and q. See that cq(0) = \u03d5(q) def = |{n \u2264q : (n, q) = 1}| is Euler\u2019s Totient; while cq(1) = \u00b5(q) is M\u00a8obius function, that is \u00b5(q) def = 0 on q \u2208N multiples of the square of some prime p, say p2|q, instead on square-free q \u2208N (no prime p has p2|q) it\u2019s \u00b5(q) def = (\u22121)\u03c9(q), where \u03c9(q) def = |{p \u2208P : p|q}| is the number of prime-factors of our q \u2208N. In particular, \u03c9(1) = 0 entails \u00b5(1) = 1. These two instances are particular cases of H\u00a8older\u2019s Formula [M], compare Chapter 26 [D] : (1) cq(a) = \u03d5(q)\u00b5(q/(a, q)) \u03d5(q/(a, q)), \u2200q \u2208N, \u2200a \u2208Z that, in particular, ensures that all Ramanujan Sums cq(a) are integers, whatever a, q above. Surprisingly enough, we may use them as a kind of \u201charmonics\u201d, say, for the Arithmetic Functions; these are all the functions F : N \u2192C and this is, actually, the idea of Ramanujan [R] : given F, we look for another arithmetic function G : N \u2192C that we call a Ramanujan coe\ufb03cient for F, by de\ufb01nition, IFF following limit exists, over x \u2192\u221e, in C and \u2200a \u2208N, F(a) = \u221e X q=1 G(q)cq(a) def = lim x X q\u2264x G(q)cq(a) \u2208C, a formula that, in fact, is called the Ramanujan Expansion for F with coe\ufb03cient G. Ramanujan Himself [R] gave, for the null-function, de\ufb01ned as 0(a) def = 0, \u2200a \u2208N, the Ramanujan Expansion \u2200a \u2208N, 0(a) = \u221e X q=1 1 q cq(a).
