  "title": "On the Relation Between Galerkin Approximations and Canonical Best-Approximations of Solutions to So.pdf",
  "abstract": ". In this paper, we establish a superconvergence property of Galerkin approximations to some non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger equations of Gross-Pitaevskii type. More precisely, denoting by u\u2217\u2208 X \u2286H1(\u2126) the exact solution to such an equation, by {X\u03b4}\u03b4>0, a sequence of conforming subspaces of X satisfying the approximation property, by u\u2217 \u03b4 \u2208X\u03b4 the Galerkin solution to the equation, and by \u03a0X \u03b4 u\u2217, the (\u00b7, \u00b7)X-best approximation in X\u03b4 of u\u2217, we show \u2013 under some assumptions \u2013 that u\u2217 \u03b4 converges at a higher rate to \u03a0X \u03b4 u\u2217than to u\u2217in both the L2 norm and the canonical H1 norm. Our results apply to conforming \ufb01nite element discretisations as well as spectral Galerkin methods based on polynomials or Fourier (plane-wave) expansions. 1. Background and Setting The present contribution is concerned with solutions to the following Gross-Pitaevskii type energy minimisation problems: The Source Problem E\u2217 src :=min u\u2208X \u001a Esrc(u) := 1 2 Z \u2126 |\u2207u(x)|2 dx + 1 2 Z \u2126 V (x)|u(x)|2 dx + 1 4 Z \u2126 |u(x)|4 dx, \u2212 f, u X\u2217\u00d7X \u001b , (1.1) The Eigenvalue Problem E\u2217 eig := min u\u2208X \u2225u\u2225L2(\u2126)=1 \u001a Eeig(u) := 1 2 Z \u2126 |\u2207u(x)|2 dx + 1 2 Z \u2126 V (x)|u(x)|2 dx + 1 4 Z \u2126 |u(x)|4 dx \u001b , (1.2) under one of the following two settings: Setting One: \u2126= (\u22121, 1)d, d \u2208{1, 2, 3} and X = H1 0(\u2126). Moreover, the source function f \u2208Hs(\u2126) for s \u22650 while the e\ufb00ective potential V is positive and V \u2208Hrv(\u2126) for rv > d/2; Setting Two: \u2126is a d-dimensional torus (isomorphic to the unit cell \u02dc\u2126of some periodic lattice L in Rd), d \u2208{1, 2, 3} and X = H1(\u2126) (isomorphic to H1 per(\u02dc\u2126)). Moreover, the source function f \u2208Hs(\u2126) for s \u22650 while the e\ufb00ective potential V is bounded below by Vmin > 0 and V \u2208Hrv(\u2126) for rv > d/2. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 65N15, 65N25, 65N30, 65N35.
