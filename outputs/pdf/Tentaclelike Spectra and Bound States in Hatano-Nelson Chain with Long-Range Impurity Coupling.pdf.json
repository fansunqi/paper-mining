  "abstract": "In this paper, we study the effect of long-range impurity coupling, located far from the boundaries, on the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hatano- Nelson model. Through exact analytical treatment, we reveal the intriguing tentacle-like spectral structures that emerge from the otherwise Bloch or non-Bloch spectra under periodic or open bound- ary conditions, respectively. We show that these spectral tentacles are associated with emergent bound states near the impurity, with their number determined by the coupling range. We further determine the localization length of these tentacled states using the transfer matrix. Our work indicates that the long-range impurity coupling cannot be treated as a mere perturbative effect and holds promise for state manipulations in non-Hermitian systems. I. INTRODUCTION Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a plethora of intrigu- ing properties that go beyond those found in Hermitian systems [1\u20136]. A notable example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) [7\u201318], where an extensive number of eigenstates are pushed to the boundaries, which has been extensively studied experimentally[19\u201327]. In non- Hermitian systems, the energy spectra are highly depen- dent on the boundary conditions. Typically, under peri- odic boundary conditions (PBC), the spectra form closed loops on the complex plane [28], while under open bound- ary conditions (OBC), they form open arcs [29, 30]. This spectral sensitivity leads to promising applications such as loss-induced transparency [31], unidirectional invisi- bility [32, 33] and high-performance senser [34, 35]. The distinct spectral structures associated with dif- ferent boundary conditions are governed by non-Bloch band theory [8, 9]. Beyond boundary conditions, non- Hermitian systems with domain walls [36\u201338], disorders [39, 40], impurities [41\u201343], and varying lattice geome- tries [44\u201347] have also garnered significant attention, dis- playing characteristics markedly different from Hermitian systems and altering our understanding of Bloch band theory. For impurity problems, there are two scenar- ios: local (e.g., onsite potential variations) and non-local impurities. Previous studies have shown that a local impurity can induce scale-free localization [41\u201343, 48\u2013 50], where eigenstates accumulate near the impurity and the localization length depends linearly on the system size. However, the effect of non-local impurities (e.g., \u2217xmzhao@ustb.edu.cn \u2020 hhu@iphy.ac.cn long-range impurity coupling as depicted in Fig. 1(a) on non-Hermitian systems remains unclear. Such long- range coupling can be implemented e.g., via tuning the spectrum or optical gain of pump light in photonic lat- tice or via flexible RLC-component wiring in electric circuits[19, 20, 22, 51\u201354]. From a perturbative perspec- tive, one might intuitively guess that long-range impurity coupling far from the boundary would rarely impact the spectra and eigenstates because the skin modes reside at the boundaries. However, the perturbative intuition of- ten does not hold true for non-Hermitian systems. The question remains: would such non-local impurities signif- icantly reshape the energy spectra and eigenstates? In this paper, we study the paradigmatic Hatano- Nelson chain with long-range impurity coupling. Through an exact analysis of the energy spectra and eigenstates, we reveal the emergence of spectral tenta- cles on the otherwise Bloch or non-Bloch spectra under PBC or OBC, respectively. We show that these tenta- cled states correspond to bound states near the impu- rity, with their number determined by the impurity cou- pling range and coupling strength, but not the system size. Furthermore, the localization properties of these tentacled states are determined using the transfer ma- trix method. Our results thus challenge the perturba- tive intuition, highlighting the significant differences be- tween non-Hermitian and Hermitian systems, as well as between non-local and local impurities. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the band structure of the Hatano-Nelson model under different boundary conditions and present the ana- lytical solutions of the energy spectra with long-range im- purity coupling. In Sec. III, we derive the self-consistent equation that determines the eigenspectra and show the emergence of spectral tentacles under different boundary conditions. In Sec. IV, we focus on the tentacled eigen- arXiv:2502.10494v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn] 14 Feb 2025"
