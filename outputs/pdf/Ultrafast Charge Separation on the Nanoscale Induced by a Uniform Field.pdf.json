  "abstract": "Here, we show that this effect can be translated from energy to space: a spatially uniform laser pulse can create strongly localized carrier excitations, including excitons, and spatial charge separation on the sub-nanometer scale within a few femtoseconds, opening new avenues for nanoelectronics and bringing petahertz switching within reach. Using nonequilibrium Green functions simulations we demonstrate this effect by exciting targeted areas of small graphene nanoribbon heterostructures by careful choice of the laser energy and polarization. Progress in nanotechnology is currently severely limited by electronic switching speeds in the GHz range. To over- come this, various ideas have been put forward that use single-cycle optical pulses which would achieve petahertz switching. Rybka et al. demonstrated coherent light wave control of electronic currents in plasmonic nanocircuits [1]. This was extended by Keathley et al. to photoemission from gold nanoantennas [2]. Light field driven real and vir- tual carriers were reported by Hommelhoff and co-workers in Ref. [3], who also demonstrated the important role of electronic correlation effects in ultrafast photoemission [4]. Subfemtosecond light-driven charge dynamics were re- ported in Refs. [5] and [6]. A second direction of progress is to exploit the potential of novel quantum materials of reduced dimensionality, such as monolayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). They offer a very broad range of electronic and optical properties including strong excitonic effects [7\u201311]. Additional de- grees of freedom emerge when the system dimensions are further reduced to only a few nanometers and the shape of the monolayer clusters is varied. Particularly promis- ing candidates are nanoclusters of graphene or TMDCs, graphene nanoribbons (GNR) [12\u201315], and nanographenes [16]. Here we concentrate on GNRs because of their interest- ing electronic properties [13], which are controlled by cor- relation effects [17, 18], as well as strong excitonic effects [19]. Zigzag GNR were shown to host ferromagnetically ordered edge states [20, 21], whereas topological junction states in GNR have been proposed as molecule sensing devices [22]. Of particular interest is the appearance of topological in gap states that are spatially localized at particular points of the GNR [18, 23, 24]. This non-trivial electronic structure is expected to give rise to interesting response behavior, when GNR are excited by a laser pulse. Indeed, in Ref. [3] it was demonstrated that electron gen- eration can be controlled by the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the laser, whereas Ref. [25] reported excitation of large electrical currents along the GNR axis for special pulse forms. In this Letter we predict and demonstrate a different effect: excitation of spatially localized electrons or excitons, on the time scale of a few femtoseconds, the location of which can be controlled by the laser frequency and polarization. This effect occurs even when the GNR heterostructure is excited with a spatially uniform laser pulse \u2013 a property that is of high potential interest for nanoelectronics and femtosecond switching. Model\u2014We model the graphene nanostructures sub- ject to a uniform laser pulse with field strength E(t) by describing the \u03c0 electrons within the Pariser\u2013Parr\u2013Pople (PPP) lattice model [26] which includes an on-site en- ergy term (\u03f5), nearest neighbor hopping with amplitude J, Hubbard-type onsite interaction (U) and long-range Coulomb interactions (Vij), \u02c6H(t) = \u03f5 X i,\u03c3 \u02c6c\u2020 i,\u03c3\u02c6ci,\u03c3 \u2212J X \u27e8i,j\u27e9,\u03c3 \u02c6c\u2020 i,\u03c3\u02c6cj,\u03c3 + U X i \u02c6ni,\u2191\u02c6ni,\u2193+ 1 2 X i\u0338=j,\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 Vij (\u02c6ni,\u03c3 \u22121) (\u02c6nj,\u03c3\u2032 \u22121) + e X i ri \u00b7 E(t) \u02c6ni, (1) where the latter are interpolated using the Ohno parametrization [27]. The operators \u02c6c\u2020 i,\u03c3 and \u02c6ci,\u03c3 cre- ate and annihilate an electron of spin \u03c3 at lattice site i, and \u02c6n is the particle number operator. The set of model parameters is taken from Ref. [28] as J = 2.34 eV, \u03f5 = \u22123.25 J and U = 3.54 J, which was shown to closely reproduce the ab initio GW band gaps of a wide range of freestanding graphene nanoribbons [29]. Screening of the local and long-range interactions by an underlying surface is taken into account by rescaling the interaction parameter U. For Figs. 1\u20133 this effective interaction is set to a significantly reduced value of U/J = 2, which corresponds to strong external screening by a metallic sub- strate, such as Au(111) [18, 30]. The electron dynamics of system (1) that is induced by a spatially uniform short laser pulse is computed using the recently developed G1\u2013 G2 scheme, an efficient time-linear Nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) approach [31\u201333]. We employ the DSL approximation [34] that accounts for dynamical screening and strong correlation effects simultaneously (GW plus vertex corrections) and applies to conditions far from equilibrium.
