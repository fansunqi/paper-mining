  "abstract": ". We describe how boundary paths in a graph can be used to con- struct irreducible representations of the associated graph C\u2217-algebra and the associated Leavitt path algebra. We use this construction to establish two sets of results: First, we prove that Naimark\u2019s Problem has an a\ufb03rmative an- swer for graph C\u2217-algebras, we prove that the algebraic analogue of Naimark\u2019s Problem has an a\ufb03rmative answer for Leavitt path algebras, and we give nec- essary and su\ufb03cient conditions on the graphs for the hypotheses of Naimark\u2019s Problem to be satis\ufb01ed. Second, we characterize when a graph C\u2217-algebra has a countable (i.e., \ufb01nite or countably in\ufb01nite) spectrum, and prove that in this case the unitary equivalence classes of irreducible representations are in one- to-one correspondence with the shift-tail equivalence classes of the boundary paths of the graph. 1. Introduction Since the fundamental Gelfand-Naimark theorem of C\u2217-algebra theory was \ufb01rst established in 1941, the study of representations has been of paramount importance in understanding C\u2217-algebras. One of the earliest questions about the representa- tion theory of C\u2217-algebras was asked by Naimark in 1951, and it is now referred to as Naimark\u2019s Problem. Naimark\u2019s Problem: If a C\u2217-algebra has a unique irreducible \u2217-representation, up to unitary equivalence, is that C\u2217-algebra isomorphic to the \u2217-algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space? In the immediate years after Naimark stated his problem, progress was made for special classes of C\u2217-algebras. An a\ufb03rmative answer to Naimark\u2019s problem was ob- tained for GCR C\u2217-algebras (today more commonly known as Type I C\u2217-algebras) [10, Theorem 7.3], and an a\ufb03rmative answer was also obtained for separable C\u2217- algebras [16, Theorem 4]. However, the general question posed by the problem remained open for decades, until a major accomplishment in 2004 when Akemann and Weaver used Jensen\u2019s \u2666axiom, a combinatorial principle known to be in- dependent of ZFC, to construct a counterexample to Naimark\u2019s problem that is generated by \u21351 elements [5]. This shows that an a\ufb03rmative answer to Naimark\u2019s Date: February 7, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 16S88, 46L55. Key words and phrases.
