  "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabili- ties in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. How- ever, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise\u2014a significant limitation considering that only 0.03% of the global pop- ulation possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce MetaChain - a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, MetaChain comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self- Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention.
