  "abstract": "In an in\ufb01nite dimensional separable Hilbert space X, we study compactness properties and the hypercontractivity of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution operators Ps,t in the spaces Lp(X, \u03b3t), {\u03b3t}t\u2208R being a suitable evolution system of measures for Ps,t. Moreover we study the asymptotic behavior of Ps,t. All these results are produced thank to a representation of Ps,t through the second quantization operator. Among the examples we consider the transition evolution operator associated to a non-autonomous stochastic parabolic PDE. 1 Introduction Let (X, \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9X, \u2225\u00b7 \u2225X) be a separable Hilbert space. Let {U(t, s)}s\u2264t be an evolution operator in X and let {B(t)}t\u2208R be a strongly continuous family of linear bounded operators on X. In this paper we consider the evolution operator {Ps,t}s\u2264t de\ufb01ned on the space of bounded and Borel measurable functions \u03d5 by Pt,t = I, \u2200t \u2208R, Ps,t\u03d5(x) = Z X \u03d5(y) NU(t,s)x,Q(t,s)(dy), s < t, x \u2208X, where NU(t,s)x,Q(t,s) is the Gaussian measure in X with mean U(t, s)x and covariance operator Q(t, s) = Z t s U(t, r)Q(r)U(t, r)\u22c6dr, Q(r) := B(r)B(r)\u22c6. (1.1) As shown in [22, 47], Ps,t extends to Lp-type spaces of measures belonging to a evolution systems of measures for Ps,t, namely families of Borel probability measures {\u03b3t}t\u2208R in X such that Z X Ps,t\u03d5(x)\u03b3s(dx) = Z X \u03d5(x)\u03b3t(dx). Moreover in [22, 47] the authors gave conditions that guarantee existence and uniqueness of an evo- lution system of measures {\u03b3t}t\u2208R where \u03b3t is the Gaussian measure with mean zero and covariance operator Q(t, \u2212\u221e) = Z t \u2212\u221e U(t, r)Q(r)U(t, r)\u22c6dr, and it satis\ufb01es lim s\u2192\u2212\u221ePs,t\u03d5(x) = Z X \u03d5(y) \u03b3t(dy), t \u2208R, x \u2208X, 1"
