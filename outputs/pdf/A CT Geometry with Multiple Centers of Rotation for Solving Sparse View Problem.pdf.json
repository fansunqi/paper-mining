  "abstract": "With the emergence of CNT (Carbon nanotube), static and instant CT scanning becomes possible. By transforming the traditionally rotated thermal source into a static ring array source composed of multiple CNTs, the imaging system can achieve high temporal resolution in scanning. However, due to the non-negligible packaging size of CNTs, the static CT based on CNTs faces sparse view problem, which affects the image quality by introducing streak artifacts. In this study, we based on the local correlation equation (LCE) to address the sparse view problem of static CT. The LCE is a series of partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the local correlation of Radon transform in a neighborhood projection domain. Based on LCE, we analyze the characteristic of sparse view projection and propose a scanning geometry with multiple rotation centers, which is different from existing CT devices that acquires the projection around one rotation center. Specifically, in the proposed scanning geometry, the circular ring array X-ray sources is divided into several arcs while the sources of each arc share one rotation center. All rotation centers of the arcs are uniformly distributed on a small circle. The optimal distribution of the rotation centers can be optimized by the radius of the circle. Moreover, to elevate the image quality under the sparse view reconstruction, we employed the LCE to interpolate unmeasured projections. Compared to the single rotation center scheme used in existing CT geometries, the multiple rotation centers scan contributes to a more even projection distribution with same view number. The simulated results demonstrated the efficiency and potential applications of the proposed method in static CT reconstructions.

And to maintain the image quality of reconstruction, the number of acquisitions should be sufficient. Although with advanced fabrications, CT imaging system with thermal X-ray source now can achieve relatively high temporal resolution, e.g., 3-4 circles/second for diagnosis CTs, the bulky and heavy thermal X-ray source still holds back the further development of high temporal and spatial resolution CT. Recently, carbon nanotube cold cathode has aroused much attention for its small size and instant response[1], which can be used to design high temporal and static scanning trajectory by replacing thermal X-ray source with CNT ring. However, due to non-neglectable interval between adjacent CNTs, the scanning faces sparse view problem, which degrades quality of the reconstructed images. To alleviate the artifacts, some strategies can be used by taking interpolation of the sparse data[2, 3]. Introducing compressed sensing and deep networks into the reconstruction algorithms have also brought significant 1 This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Nos. 2022YFA1204203, 2016YFA0202003) and National natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 62071375). Correspondence: xqmou@mail.xjtu.edu.cn (X. Mou) progresses for solving the sparse view problem[4-8]. In this way, image sparsity priors are employed in the iterative reconstruction algorithms to alleviate the artifacts, such as total variation (TV)[4], dictionary learning[5], low rank[6]. Benefited from deep learning (DL) technique, researchers directly performed CNNs in degraded reconstructions to recover the details[7]. Besides, researchers also embedded CNNs in iterative process to replace the traditional regularization, such as work in [8]. Moreover, DL techniques also help to interpolate on the sparse-view projections efficiently, which breeds the methods in projection domain and hybrid domain to iteratively solve the sparse-view problem[8]. Generally, the key issue of solving interpolation on signal is to correctly model the signal. Hence, it is a good solution to explore local data consistency condition (DCC) of Radon transform which can be considered as a signal model in projection domain. The local DCC is usually expressed as a partial differential equation (PDE). One local DCC model is John equation that has been widely used in cone beam data interpolation[9, 10]. But it needs to follow certain trajectory constraints and hence is hard to use generally. Another local DCC is to explored the inner relationship between detector and angle based on the Radon transform [11]. In [12], this DCC was used to directly reconstruct CT gradient image. However, for dependence on the imaging object, it is hard to solve sparse view interpolation problem. In previous work, we proposed an image independent DCC, namely local correlation equation (LCE), and transformed sparse view interpolation problem into a PDE solution [13]. We used the finite difference method to discretize the LCE equation and constructed a linear object function to solve the LCE, with the known sparse view projections serving as boundary conditions. In the case of finite differences, the more uniform the distribution of the boundary conditions, the higher the accuracy of the PDE solution. However, in existing CT scanning geometry with a single rotation center, the sparse view sampling faces the problem of uneven sampling (See Fig. 2 in II.B). In this study, we propose a CT geometry with multiple centers of rotation to alleviate the sparse view problem by offering a better boundary condition for PDE solution. Specifically, in the proposed scanning geometry, the circular ring array X-ray sources is divided into several arcs while the sources of each arc share one rotation center. All rotation centers of the arcs are uniformly distributed on a small circle. The optimal distribution of the rotation centers can be optimized by the radius of the circle. After optimization, the distribution of projections is more even compared with traditional geometry of single rotation center. Moreover, to further elevate the image quality of the sparse"
