  "title": "How Does Radiation Reaction Affect Relativistic Magnetized Shocks Emission.pdf",
  "abstract": "Relativistic magnetized shocks, through the Synchrotron Maser Instability (SMI) mechanism, represent a promising framework for generating coherent radiations, potentially accounting for the enigmatic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)\u2014cosmic radio transients with extreme luminosity. This study investigates how the radiation reaction (RR) effect, induced by high-energy photon emissions during SMI, significantly modifies particle dynamics and emission properties in magnetized shocks. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that RR effects fundamentally alter coherent cyclotron motion at shock fronts, producing distinct observational signatures: spectral broadening, peak frequency upshift, and enhanced radiation intensity. Our findings suggest that RR-mediated magnetized shocks could provide a natural explanation for the bimodal energy distribution observed in repeating FRB 121102 and the positive correlation of luminosity-bandwidth between repeating and one-off FRBs in CHIME/FRB catalog. These results support the magnetized shock as a viable source of FRBs. Introduction Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, millisecond-duration astrophysical transients with GHz frequencies, typically of extragalactic origin[1-7]. Their extreme brightness temperatures suggest a coherent emission mechanism, but the precise generation process of FRBs remains unresolved yet. Current theories predominantly favor magnetars as the central engines powering FRBs, a view bolstered by the observation of the Galactic FRB 200428 linked to a magnetar[8,9]. In magnetar environments, FRBs may originate from relativistic plasma instabilities[10] or coherent electron beam curvature radiation[11-15] within the magnetosphere, or from relativistic magnetized shocks[16-23] externally. The latter, often driven by magnetar flare ejecta colliding with magnetized winds, can produce coherent electromagnetic radiation through \"synchrotron maser instability (SMI)\"[20,24,25] -- Cold, magnetized particles entering the shock collectively accelerate and undergo synchrotron-like motion at the shock front, emitting coherent electromagnetic pulses, known as \"precursor waves\" that propagate upstream. The emission process of magnetized shocks can be quantitatively studied using kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation programs[20-22]. Studies on electron-positron shock radiation[19-21] show that magnetized shock models can explain the features of FRBs like coherence, duration, polarization and spectrum under external magnetospheric parameters, but the radiation efficiency ~ 7 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b38\ud835\udf0e\u0b36 \u2044 struggles to account for FRB's extreme luminosity in the context of magnetar winds with \ud835\udf0e ~ (10 \u2212100) [23], here \ud835\udf0e is the magnetization, defines as the ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy flux of the pre-shock flow. Recent studies on electron-ion shocks[22], with \ud835\udc5a\u0bdc\u0be2\u0be1\ud835\udc5a\u0bd8= 1 200 \u2044 \u2044 , reveal that ion involvement allows precursor waves to generate wake-fields upstream, accelerating electrons and boosting energy conversion efficiency to ~ 10\u0b3f\u0b37 even at \ud835\udf0e= 100, thereby adequately accounting for FRB luminosity. Given FRBs\u2019 enormous isotropic luminosity \ud835\udc3f ~ (10\u0b37\u0b3c\u2212 10\u0b38\u0b3a) erg s \u2044 [7,8,26,27], the normalized field near source can be estimated as1 \ud835\udc4e\u0b34 ~ 10\u0b38\ud835\udc3f\u0b38\u0b38 \u0b35\u0b36 \u2044 \ud835\udc45\u0b35\u0b34 \u0b3f\u0b35\ud835\udf14\u0b35\u0b34 \u0b3f\u0b35, where \ud835\udc45 is FRBs\u2019 transport distance from the source, \ud835\udf14 is the angular frequency. During radiation or initial propagation near the source, electrons/positrons in such a strong field are expected 1 the convention \ud835\udc44\u0beb= \ud835\udc4410\u0beb \u2044 is adopted in cgs units unless otherwise specified."
