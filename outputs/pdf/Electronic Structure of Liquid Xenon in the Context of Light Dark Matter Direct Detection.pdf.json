We compare the calculated electronic structures of the atomic, liquid and crystalline solid phases, and find that the electronic charge density and its derivatives in momentum space are similar in the atom and the liquid, consistent with the weak interatomic van der Waals bonding. The only notable difference is a band broadening of the highest occupied 5p levels, reflected in the densities of states of the condensed phases, as a result of the inter-atomic interactions. We therefore use the calculated density of states of the liquid phase, combined with the standard literature approach for the isolated atom, to recompute ionisation rates and exclusion limit curves for the XENON10 and XENON1T experiments. We find that the broadening of the 5p levels induced by the liquid phase is relevant only at low dark matter masses, where it increases the ionisation rate relative to that of the isolated atom. For most of the probable mass range the energies of the discrete 4d and 5s levels have the strongest effect on the rate. Our findings suggest a simple scheme for calculating dark matter-electron scattering rates in liquid noble gas detectors, using the calculated values for the atom weighted by the density of states of the condensed phase. I. INTRODUCTION According to the current cosmological standard model, more than 80% of matter in the universe is so-called dark matter (DM) [1]. DM exerts a gravitational pull on galaxies and stars and plays a crucial role in the large- scale structure formation of the universe. Although its indirect effects have been demonstrated across a wide range of measurements, non-gravitational detection of dark-matter particles [2] has not yet been achieved. Until recently, one of the most extensively investigated candidates for DM has been the weakly interacting mas- sive particle (WIMP) [3]. WIMPs are proposed particles with interactions at the weak scale that originally arose from theories outside of the area of DM, such as super- symmetry [4, 5]. The expected mass range of WIMPs is between the GeV and few hundreds of TeV energy scale, which is comparable to the mass of atomic nu- clei [4]. Elastic scattering of WIMPs with atomic nu- clei should therefore be kinematically favourable, mo- tivating large-scale experiments to detect the possible \u2217riccardo.catena@chalmers.se \u2020 luca.marin@mat.ethz.ch \u2021 marek.matas@fjfi.cvut.cz \u00a7 nspaldin@ethz.ch \u00b6 einarurdshals@gmail.com signal coming from individual nuclear recoils. In par- ticular, earth-based detectors containing liquid xenon as the target material have achieved the highest sensitiv- ity to spin-independent DM interactions in the WIMP mass range [6, 7]. The lack of an unambiguous detec- tion, however, is now motivating a search outside of the WIMP paradigm, particularly in regions of smaller DM particle masses in the range between the MeV and the GeV [8]. This is the mass window where known standard model particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons, lie, and where the present DM cosmological density could be explained by the chemical decoupling from standard model matter of a DM species that couples to visible mat- ter through beyond-the-standard-model interactions [8]. While nuclear recoil experiments are used to search for WIMPs, DM particles lighter than WIMPs must be sought in the recoils of lighter targets such as elec- trons [9]. Since large volumes of high-purity liquid xenon are already available in existing detectors, they have been progressively repurposed to detect DM-electron interac- tions together with nuclear recoils [10\u201313]. The possi- bility of detecting sub-GeV DM with xenon detectors is based on the fact that a non-relativistic particle heavier than a few MeV carries enough kinetic energy to ionise xenon atoms in a medium [9]. To guide such an effort, an accurate calculation of the sensitivity of these detectors is crucial. In particular, reliable estimates of the expected event rates, DM-mass reach and exclusion limits for DM- electron scattering are needed. arXiv:2502.02965v1 [hep-ph] 5 Feb 2025"
