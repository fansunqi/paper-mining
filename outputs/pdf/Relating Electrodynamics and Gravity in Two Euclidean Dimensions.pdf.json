  "abstract": "Two-dimensional electrodynamics coupled to Dirac fermions is mapped onto two-dimensional grav- ity in the \ufb01rst-order formalism, also including fermions. However, the resulting fermion-gravity cou- pling deviates from the conventional form, explicitly violating parity and time-reversal symmetries. Additionally, these fermions exhibit an unconventional transformation behavior under SO(2) transfor- mations. Furthermore, we analyze the consistency of this mapping at the quantum level using the path integral formalism and Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin techniques. Our \ufb01ndings demonstrate that quantum electrodynamics and quantum gravity remain equivalent at the quantum level. 1 Introduction Electrodynamics in two dimensions exhibits several intriguing features, primarily due to its applications in two-dimensional systems in condensed matter physics (see, for instance, [1\u20133]). Moreover, it is well known that two-dimensional electrodynamics with external sources constitutes an exactly solvable system [4\u20138]. Additionally, two-dimensional models are frequently studied as simpli\ufb01ed frameworks for exploring more complex systems. On the other hand, two-dimensional gravity also holds signi\ufb01cant relevance, particularly in the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity. In two dimensions, quantum gravity models are known to be consistent [9\u201314] providing valuable insights that motivate the search for a consistent quantization of gravity in four dimensions (see [15] and references therein). Furthermore, geometrodynamical descriptions of certain gauge systems have been proposed [16\u201323], where gravity (geometrodynamics) serves as an alternative framework to standard gauge models. In a recent study [24], it was demonstrated that two-dimensional electrodynamics in Euclidean space- time can be mapped onto a geometrodynamical model. This mapping leverages the isomorphism between the groups U(1) (the gauge group of electrodynamics) and SO(2) (the gauge group of Euclidean grav- ity) to establish a connection between electrodynamics and gravity in two dimensions. It is important to note that this gauge-gravity correspondence is formulated exclusively in Euclidean spacetime, as the mapping U(1) \u2212\u2192SO(2) is straightforward. Extending this to Minkowskian spacetime, via a mapping U(1) \u2212\u2192SO(1, 1), would require an additional Wick rotation in group space.
