  "abstract": "Microchips are fundamental components of modern electronic de- vices, yet they remain opaque to the users who rely on them daily. This opacity, compounded by the complexity of global supply chains and the concealment of proprietary information, raises significant security, trust, and accountability issues. We investigate end users\u2019 understanding of microchips, exploring their perceptions of the so- cietal implications and information needs regarding these essential technologies. Through an online survey with 250 participants, we found that while our participants were aware of some microchip applications, they lacked awareness of the broader security, societal, and economic implications. While our participants unanimously desired more information on microchips, their specific informa- tion needs were shaped by various factors such as the microchip\u2019s application environment and one\u2019s affinity for technology inter- action. Our findings underscore the necessity for improving end users\u2019 awareness and understanding of microchips, and we provide possible directions to pursue this end. KEYWORDS microchips, end users, online survey, qualitative analysis, regression analysis 1 INTRODUCTION At the core of the digital revolution are microchips, tiny electronic devices that store and process digital data. A microchip contains numerous nanometer-sized electronic components (e. g., transis- tors) on a single piece of semiconductor material (typically silicon). These components work together to perform digital processing tasks such as executing computations (CPUs, GPUs), storing data (SSDs, RAM), or cryptographic and AI acceleration. Microchips serve as the basic building blocks in the electronic devices we use every day, including smartphones, vehicles, and medical equipment. As microchips have become ubiquitous and are increasingly be- ing used in critical areas, their geopolitical importance is growing. However, due to their rising complexity [9, 48, 69], a globally dis- tributed supply chain [42, 86], and intentional concealment to pro- tect trade secrets, microchips are often regarded as highly opaque. This opacity can make it challenging to identify potential safety and security issues, thereby complicating efforts to build trust in these technologies. Consequently, several concerns regarding microchips have not yet been resolved. For instance, microchips are susceptible to attacks from a diverse range of adversaries. They can be manipu- lated through hardware Trojans [2], particularly when employed in safety- and security-critical tasks such as encryption [20, 35]. Simi- larly, previous studies have demonstrated how security issues in the hardware [2, 6, 45] can impact the security of end-user devices [54]. In response to these concerns, numerous countries have intro- duced subsidies and regulations to bolster domestic microchip in- dustries [22, 68]. These measures aim to secure production, promote innovation, and foster talent while, at the same time, addressing global supply chain vulnerabilities and security threats. However, their primary goals are tied to geopolitical strategy and achieving or maintaining technological leadership, underscoring the high stakes in the global microchip race. Despite the focus on industry and geopolitics, one crucial stake- holder often overlooked in these regulatory discussions is the end user. The question arises: should users be considered, and perhaps studied, as integral stakeholders in the microchip ecosystem? We think the question is worth exploring because end users are already constantly interacting with and relying on the proper functioning of microchips in their daily lives, albeit often unknowingly and indirectly. While end users may be familiar with the fact that the CPUs within their computers are microchips, the application of mi- crochips to other technologies and devices might be more hidden. Modern cars are built from hundreds of microchips, and smart- phones and laptops contain dozens. Microchips are also increas- ingly found in medical equipment like insulin pumps, pacemakers, and ventilators\u2014technologies on which someone\u2019s life may depend. We see the potential that improving end-users\u2019 understanding of microchips can lead to numerous benefits, such as making more arXiv:2502.13749v1 [cs.HC] 19 Feb 2025"
