  "title": "The Irrelevance of Primordial Black Hole Clustering in the LVK Mass Range.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primor- dial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales. This conclusion might not hold for lighter masses potentially accessible by future gravitational wave observations. arXiv:2502.01617v1 [astro-ph.CO] 3 Feb 2025"
