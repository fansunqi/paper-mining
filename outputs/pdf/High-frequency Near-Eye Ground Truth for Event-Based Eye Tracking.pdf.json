  "abstract": ". Event-based eye tracking is a promising solution for efficient and low-power eye tracking in smart eyewear technologies. However, the novelty of event-based sensors has resulted in a limited number of avail- able datasets, particularly those with eye-level annotations, crucial for algorithm validation and deep-learning training. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an improved version of a popular event-based eye-tracking dataset. We introduce a semi-automatic annotation pipeline specifically designed for event-based data annotation. Additionally, we provide the scientific community with the computed annotations for pupil detection at 200Hz. Keywords: Smart Eyewear \u00b7 Eye Tracking 1 Introduction Eye tracking is a technology that measures and records the eye movements and positions of an individual [1], providing valuable insights into visual attention and cognitive processes [17] [19]. This technology has profound implications for various applications, ranging from user experience research [7] and medical diag- nostics [15] to advanced human-computer interaction systems [6] [25]. Moreover, with the advent and rapid diffusion of virtual reality devices [3], augmented real- ity systems [4], and smart eyewear, eye-tracking technology has become a central component in these systems to enhance the user experience and provide a more immersive and interactive environment. Thanks to the proliferation of smart wearables and smart eyewear in recent years [20], research on this topic has witnessed a significant boost. In particular, in recent years, we have seen rapid growth in the availability of commercial eye-tracking technologies [13]. These devices, equipped with advanced sensors, \u22c6Corresponding author. arXiv:2502.03057v1 [cs.CV] 5 Feb 2025"
