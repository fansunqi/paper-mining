  "abstract": "Access to health resources is a critical de- terminant of public well-being and societal resilience, particularly during public health crises when demand for medical services and preventive care surges. However, dis- parities in accessibility persist across demo- graphic and geographic groups, raising con- cerns about equity. Traditional survey meth- ods often fall short due to limitations in coverage, cost, and timeliness. This study leverages crowdsourced data from Google Maps reviews, applying advanced natural language processing techniques, specifically ModernBERT, to extract insights on public perceptions of health resource accessibility in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we employ Partial Least Squares regression to examine the re- lationship between accessibility perceptions and key socioeconomic and demographic factors\u2014including political affiliation, racial composition, educational attainment and so on. Our findings reveal that public percep- tions of health resource accessibility varied significantly across the U.S., with disparities peaking during the pandemic and slightly easing post-crisis. Political affiliation, racial demographics, and education levels emerged as key factors shaping these perceptions. These findings underscore the need for tar- geted interventions and policy measures to address inequities, fostering a more inclusive healthcare infrastructure that can better with- stand future public health challenges. 1 Introduction Access to essential health resources is fundamental to public well-being, particularly during health crises when demand surges for medical services and preven- tive care [World Health Organization, 2020]. Equi- table distribution of critical supplies\u2014such as medica- tions, personal protective equipment (PPE), and test- ing kits\u2014is vital for controlling disease spread and minimizing mortality [Sodhi et al., 2023; Roozen- beek et al., 2020]. However, disparities in health re- source availability persist, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities [Baum, 2016; Detels et al., 2021]. Traditional methods for assessing health resource accessibility\u2014such as surveys and administrative records\u2014provide valuable insights but are often con- strained by time lags, high costs, and limited spa- tial coverage [Keppel et al., 2005]. These limita- tions hinder timely interventions, particularly during rapidly evolving health crises. With the rise of digital platforms, crowdsourced data provides an alternative means to assess public perceptions of health resource accessibility [Kim et al., 2017]. Platforms like Google Maps offer granular, real-time insights into how people experience and perceive access to healthcare resources in their local communities [Jia et al., 2021]. This study examines the potential of crowdsourced data in analyzing social inequality by leveraging Google Maps reviews (2018\u20132021) to investigate how public perceptions of health resource accessibility var- ied across the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we aim to answer: RQ1: Do health resource disparities, as perceived by the public, exist across different regions in the United States? arXiv:2502.10641v1 [cs.CL] 15 Feb 2025"
