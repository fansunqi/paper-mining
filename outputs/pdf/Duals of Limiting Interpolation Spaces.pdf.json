  "title": "Duals of Limiting Interpolation Spaces.pdf",
  "abstract": ". The aim of the paper is to establish duals of the limiting real interpolation K- and J-spaces (X0, X1)0,q,v;K and (X0, X1)0,q,v;J, where (X0, X1) is a compatible couple of Banach spaces, 1 \u2264q < \u221e, v is a slowly varying function on the interval (0, \u221e), and the symbols K and J stand for the Peetre K- and J-functionals. In the case of the classical real interpolation method (X0, X1)\u03b8,q, where \u03b8 \u2208(0, 1) and 1 \u2264q < \u221e, this problem was solved by Lions and Peetre. 1. Introduction Dual spaces play a very important role in numerous parts of mathematics. The same can be said about spaces which appear in the real interpolation (cf., e.g., monographs [BB67], [BL76], [Tri78], [KPS78], [BS88], [BK91], [L18]). In this paper our goal is to describe duals of the limiting real interpolation K- and J- spaces (X0, X1)0,q,v;K and (X0, X1)0,q,v;J, where (X0, X1) is a compatible couple of Banach spaces, 1 \u2264q < \u221e, v is a slowly varying function on the interval (0, \u221e), and the symbols K and J stand for the Peetre K- and J-functionals. Note that we express these duals both in terms of K-spaces and J-spaces. In the case \u03b8 \u2208(0, 1), 1 \u2264q < \u221e, and when the slowly varying function v satis\ufb01es v(t) = 1 for all t \u2208(0, \u221e), we obtain the classical real interpolation spaces (X0, X1)\u03b8,q, which are independent on the fact whether the K- or J-functional is used to de\ufb01ne them (see, e.g., [BS88, Chapter 5, Theorem 2.8 (Equivalence theorem)]). Duals of these spaces have been described by Lions and Peetre in their fundamental paper [LP64] (see also [Li61]). It has been proved there that (X0, X1)\u2032 \u03b8,q = (X\u2032 0, X\u2032 1)\u03b8,q \u2032 (with equivalent norms), where 1/q + 1/q \u2032 = 1. However, some problems in mathematical analysis have motivated the investigation of the real interpolation with the limiting values \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = 1. Nowadays, there is a lot of works, where the limiting real interpolation is studied or applied (see, e.g., [GM86], [Mil94], [Dok91], [EO00], [EOP02], [GOT05], [CFCKU09], [CFCM10], [AEEK11], [FMS12], [EO14], [FMS14], [CD15], [CS15], [CFCM15], [FMS15], [CD16], [CDT16], [Dok18], [FFGKR18], [CFC19], [AFH20], [BCFC20], [NO20], [OG23], [DT23], [CFCG24], [OG24], and the refer- ences given there). In order that the spaces (X0, X1)\u03b8,q are meaningful also with limiting values \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = 1 in a general case, one has to extend the given interpolation functor by a convenient weight v. This weight v usually belongs to the class SV (0, \u221e) of slowly varying functions on the interval (0, \u221e). If \u03b8 \u2208(0, 1), then the corresponding space (X0, X1)\u03b8,q,v is a particular case of an interpolation space with a function parameter and, by [Gu78, Theorem 2.2], this 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 46B70, 26D15, 26D10, 26A12, 46E30.
