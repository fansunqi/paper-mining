  "abstract": ". In this work, we consider the initial value problem (IVP) for a system of modi\ufb01ed Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 \u2202tv + \u22023 xv + \u2202x(vw2) = 0, v(x, 0) = \u03c8(x), \u2202tw + \u03b1\u22023 xw + \u2202x(v2w) = 0, w(x, 0) = \u03c6(x). The main interest is in addressing the well-posedness issues of the IVP when the initial data are considered in the modulation space M 2,p s (R), p \u22652. In the case when 0 < \u03b1 \u0338= 1, we derive new trilinear estimates in these spaces and prove that the IVP is locally well-posed for data in M 2,p s (R) whenever s > 1 4 \u22121 p and p \u22652. 1. Introduction In this work, we consider the initial value problem (IVP) for the following system of the modi\ufb01ed Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) type equations \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 \u2202tv + \u22023 xv + \u2202x(vw2) = 0, v(x, 0) = \u03c8(x), \u2202tw + \u03b1\u22023 xw + \u2202x(v2w) = 0, w(x, 0) = \u03c6(x), (1.1) with given data in modulation spaces (see (2.2) below), where x, t \u2208R, 0 < \u03b1 \u0338= 1, v = v(x, t) and w = w(x, t) are real-valued functions. For \u03b1 = 1 the system (1.1) reduces to a special case of broad class of nonlinear evolution cosidered by Ablowitz, Kaup, Newell and Segur [1] in the inverse scattering context. In this scenario, the issues of well-posedness, existence, and stability of solitary waves for this system have been exten- sively investigated in the literature. Applying the technique developed by Kenig, Ponce and Vega [24], we can prove that the IVP (1.1) is locally well-posed for given data in Hs(R) \u00d7 Hs(R), for s \u22651 4 and \u03b1 = 1. This approach utilizes the smoothing e\ufb00ect of the linear group, combined with the Lp xLq t Strichartz estimates and maximal function estimates. Tao [32] demonstrated that this local result can also be established using the restricted norm method in the Fourier transform space Xs,b, as introduced by Bourgain [4]. In [26] Montenegro proved the local well-posedness for s \u22651 4 and, using the conservation laws of the 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 35A01, 35Q53. Key words and phrases.
