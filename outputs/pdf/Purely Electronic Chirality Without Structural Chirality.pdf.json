  "abstract": "In condensed matter physics and chemistry, chirality has conventionally been understood as a mirror-image asymmetry in crystal or molecular structures. We demonstrate that certain electronic orders exhibit chirality-related properties without atomic displacement. Specifically, we investigate quadrupole orders to realize such purely electronic chirality with handedness that can be tuned by magnetic fields. As a representative example, we analyze a model featuring 120\u25e6antiferro quadrupole orders on a distorted kagom\u00b4e lattice, predicting various chirality-related responses in the nonmagnetic ordered phase of URhSn. Furthermore, as a phonon analog, chiral phonons can emerge in achiral crystals through coupling with the pEC order. Our results provide a distinct origin of chirality and a fundamental basis for exploring the interplay between electronic and structural chirality. Introduction.\u2014Chirality, grounded in the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, manifests across diverse fields of natural science [1]. Since Pasteur\u2019s sem- inal discovery of the connection between optical activity and molecular chirality [2], this concept has evolved to encompass phenomena such as parity symmetry breaking in particle physics [3, 4] and the double-helix structure of DNA [5, 6]. In materials science, chirality is typically understood as the mirror asymmetry of atomic positions, whereas in particle physics, it is defined through the in- ternal degrees of freedom in elementary particles. This raises the fundamental question: can the concept of chi- rality in materials science exist independently of mirror asymmetry in atomic positions? Recently, it has been shown that the order parameter of chirality is the electric toroidal monopole (ETM)[7, 8], a time-reversal even pseudoscalar [9, 10] in electronic degrees of freedom. Since then, the ETM has attracted significant attention, linking it to the chirality of Dirac electrons [11], possible antiferroic ordering of the atomic chirality [12], and first-principle evaluation of ETM [13, 14]. However, despite these advancements, the source of orderings of the electronic chirality has been considered due to the structural origin. In this Letter, we show that the electronic chirality can emerge solely from electronic orderings, without struc- tural chirality. This phenomenon occurs in achiral sys- tems through the chiral symmetry breaking while pre- serving the original achiral structure. We call it purely electronic chirality (pEC). We outline a way to construct the chirality from electric quadrupole moments of elec- trons, as the electric quadrupole moments are active in various systems with orbital degrees of freedom. The most straightforward approach to constructing the ETM G0 is to take the inner product of polar and axial vectors: G0 \u221dG \u00b7 Q, where Q = (Qx, Qy, Qz) repre- sents the electric dipole moment, and G = (Gx, Gy, Gz) (a) (b) b) x y 3 1 2 R x y 3 1 2 z z FIG. 1.

In the fol- lowing, we denote time-reversal even polar (axial) ten- sors as Q\u2019s (G\u2019s) [15]. To construct G0 via the rela- tion G0 \u221dG \u00b7 Q, both G and Q must be present as microscopic degrees of freedom, whereas they need not be finite in the bulk. We note that rotational symme- try prohibits finite bulk G and Q perpendicular to the rotational axis, while it imposes no restrictions on the scalar G0. A quantum mechanical expression of the ax- ial vector G is G = l \u00d7 \u03c3, where l and \u03c3 are the or- bital and spin angular momentum operators for the elec- tron, respectively [15]. A key observation is that cer- tain quadrupole moments Q\u00b5\u03bd (\u00b5, \u03bd = x, y, z) and G are hybridized by uniaxial crystalline electric fields (CEF) O20 \u221d3l2 z \u2212l(l + 1) in two-dimensional systems. This hybridization enables the realization of pEC through simple quadrupole orders in layered systems.
