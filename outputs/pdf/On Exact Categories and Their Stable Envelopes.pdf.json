  "abstract": ". We show that Klemenc\u2019s stable envelope of exact \u221e-categories induces an equivalence between stable \u221e-categories with a bounded heart structure and weakly idempotent complete exact \u221e-categories. Moreover, we generalise the Gillet\u2013Waldhausen theorem to the connective algebraic K-theory of exact \u221e-categories and deduce a universal property of connective algebraic K-theory as an additive invariant on exact \u221e-categories. A key tool is a generalisation of a theorem due to Keller which provides a su\ufb03cient condition for an exact functor to induce a fully faithful functor on stable envelopes. Contents 1.

Introduction Exact categories were invented by Quillen in [Qui73] to get around the following problem: if R is a regular ring, then there exist two equivalent presentations of K0(R), either as the group-completion of set of isomorphism classes of objects in the additive category of \ufb01nitely generated projective modules, or by considering the category of \ufb01nitely presented modules and further modding out by exact sequences. Exact categories provide an interpolation between these two extremes. Barwick observed in [Bar15] that a suitable formulation of the de\ufb01nition of an exact category can be adopted verbatim to de\ufb01ne the notion of an exact \u221e-category as an additive \u221e-category equipped with a notion of exact sequences, see Section 2. Minimally, every additive \u221e-category becomes an exact \u221e-category by declaring only the split bi\ufb01bre sequences to be exact. Maximally, a stable \u221e-category carries an exact structure in which every bi\ufb01bre sequence is an exact sequence. It is easy to check that the \u221e-categories Catadd of additive \u221e-categories and Catst of stable \u221e-categories both become full subcategories of Exact in this way. The inclusion 1"
