In this paper, we propose a novel approach by drawing an analogy between STAR models and a multilayer neural network architecture. Our proposed neural network architecture mimics the STAR framework, employing multiple layers to simulate the smooth transition between regimes and capturing complex, nonlinear re- lationships. The network\u2019s hidden layers and activation functions are structured to replicate the gradual switching behavior typical of STAR models, allowing for a more \ufb02exible and scalable approach to regime- dependent modeling. This research suggests that neural networks can provide a powerful alternative to STAR models, with the potential to enhance predictive accuracy in economic and \ufb01nancial forecasting. 1 Introduction A critical aspect of econometric modeling is dealing with non-linearities in time series data. Traditional linear models, such as the Autoregressive (AR) models, often fail to capture the complex relationships inherent in time-dependent data. Real-world time series frequently exhibit nonlinear behaviors, such as asymmet- ric cycles and threshold e\ufb00ects, which cannot be adequately addressed using linear frameworks. These limitations have driven the development of nonlin- ear econometric models, including Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) models [25, 24], which allow for smooth transitions between regimes to better represent nonlinear dynamics. STAR models have been extensively applied in various domains, particularly in economics and \ufb01nance, where their ability to \u00a7These authors contributed equally. \u2217CREST, IP Paris, 5 avenue Henry le Chatelier, 91129 Palaiseau, France.
