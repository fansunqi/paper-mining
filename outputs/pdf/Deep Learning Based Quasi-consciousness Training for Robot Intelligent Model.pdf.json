  "abstract": "This paper explores a deep learning based robot intelligent model that renders robots learn and reason for complex tasks. First, by constructing a network of environmental factor matrix to stimulate the learning process of the robot intelligent model, the model parameters must be subjected to coarse & fine tuning to optimize the loss function for minimizing the loss score, meanwhile robot intelligent model can fuse all previously known concepts together to represent things never experienced before, which need robot intelligent model can be generalized extensively. Secondly, in order to progressively develop a robot intelligent model with primary consciousness, every robot must be subjected to at least 1~3 years of special school for training anthropomorphic behaviour patterns to understand and process complex environmental information and make rational decisions. This work explores and delivers the potential application of deep learning-based quasi-consciousness training in the field of robot intelligent model.

Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in the more than 70 years since it was proposed, and AI proceeds on the conjecture that all aspects of learning, or any feature of intelligence, can in principle be accurately described so that a machine can be built to simulate it. Turing argued that in principle computers could mimic aspects of human intelligence 1. Ray Solomonoff, Founding Father of Algorithmic Information Theory, early proposed priori probabilities assigned sequences symbols on basis lengths for universal Turing machine that required produce interest as output 2. Although it only began to flourish in the 1990s, machine learning has quickly grown to become the most popular and successful branch of artificial intelligence. Over the last decade, deep learning, as a branch of machine learning, has made major breakthroughs in many tasks that were once thought to be extremely difficult for computers, particularly in the field of machine perception. This field requires the extraction of useful information from images, video, and sound, and given enough training data, deep * Corresponding author. E-mail address: zhangf@csust.edu.cn (F. Zhang)."
