  "abstract": "While, in its traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent studies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic metrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital delays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays obtained from pre-launch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing scheme presented in this article naturally treats onboard delays as part of the TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it directly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard measurements, especially pseudo-random- noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The only onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR delays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable digital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in post-processing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior interspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for potential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement systems. The proposed observable-based processing scheme significantly strengthens the bond between TDI and the real metrology system. I. INTRODUCTION On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) achieved the first di- rect gravitational wave (GW) detection [1]. In the following years, many GW signals have been detected by ground-based observatories [2\u20134]. However, these detectors are limited by seismic and gravity gradient noise below 1 Hz. Launching a detector into space will overcome this limit and open up chan- nels into the millihertz regime, which is rich in GWs from sys- tems involving heavier astronomical bodies, such as massive black hole binaries and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals [5]. There are several missions aiming for spaceborne GW de- tection [6\u20138]. One of them is the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which is sensitive for GWs in the frequency band between 0.1 mHz and 1 Hz [9]. LISA comprises three spacecraft (SC) on heliocentric orbits that form a nearly equi- lateral triangle with an armlength of about 2.5 Gm, corre- sponding to an interspacecraft light travel time (ILTT) of about 8.3 s. GWs induce picometer armlength variations in this constellation. To achieve the picometer-stable armlength measurements, LISA employs single-link interspacecraft laser interferometry using a split interferometry concept. Each LISA SC houses two free-falling test masses (TMs) as local gravity field references [10, 11], which are oriented toward the respective distant SC. An ultrastable optical bench (OB) [12] is associated with each TM and placed between the TM and the distant SC (see Figure 1). A 1064 nm laser [13] is fiber-fed to the OB, from where it is directed to the dis- tant SC via a telescope [14] and to the adjacent OB through \u2217y9m9k0h@gmail.com a fiber backlink [15].1 On the OB, the laser beam is used as a local oscillator in three heterodyne interferometers: The in- terspacecraft interferometer (ISI) measures distance variations between the local and distant OBs by interfering the received distant beam with the local one. GW signals accumulate in the ISI measurements. The TM interferometer (TMI) measures distance variations between the OB and the TM by interfer- ing the adjacent beam with the local one after it is reflected off the free-falling TM along the interspacecraft axis. The reference interferometer (RFI) interferes the adjacent and the local beam without involving the TM. The megahertz beat- notes in these interferometers are detected with quadrant pho- toreceivers (QPRs) [16]. Each MOSA is paired with a multi- channel phasemeter that simultaneously extracts all beatnote phases [17, 18]. A single master clock per SC drives both onboard phasemeters. A priori LISA\u2019s interferometric measurements are domi- nated by laser frequency noise, which surpasses any GW sig- nal by 8 orders of magnitude. LISA relies on a sophisti- cated post-processing scheme called time-delay interferome- try (TDI) to synthesize equal-arm interferometers, in which laser frequency noise naturally cancels [19, 20]. 2 In the first step, TDI combines the ISI, TMI, and RFI beatnotes to form single-link interspacecraft TM-to-TM measurements, thus suppressing the OB jitter along the interspacecraft axes. 1 The sets of TMs, OBs, and telescopes are referred to as movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs). Each SC has two of them. Their angles are ad- justable to compensate for corner angle variations. 2 The underlying concept of TDI is similar to Displacement-Noise Free In- terferometers [21\u201323] in the context of ground-based GW detection, which utilize the difference between the light field coupling to GW signals and mirror displacements. arXiv:2502.11231v1 [astro-ph.IM] 16 Feb 2025"
