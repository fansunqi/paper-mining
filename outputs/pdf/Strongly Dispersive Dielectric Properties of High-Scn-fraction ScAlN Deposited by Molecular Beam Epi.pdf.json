  "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of dielectric properties including permittivity, loss, and leakage of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN thin films grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Dielectric spectroscopy is carried out on high-ScN-fraction (30%-40% ScN fraction) samples from 20 Hz to 10 GHz. We find that real permittivity \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\u2032 increases significantly with increasing ScN fraction; a trend confirmed by density functional theory. Further, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\u2032 is strongly dispersive with frequency and increasing ScN fraction, with values for Sc0.4Al0.6N varying from 150 down to 60 with increasing frequency. Loss, dispersion, and DC leakage current correspondingly increase with ScN fraction. The high \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\u2032 and strongly dispersive behavior in MBE ScAlN are not observed in a sputter-deposited ScAlN control with a similar ScN fraction, highlighting fundamental differences between films produced by the two deposition methods. Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses are carried out on MBE- and sputter-deposited samples to compare microstructure, alloy, and dopant concentration. II. Introduction The initial development of the ternary alloy scandium aluminum nitride Sc\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65Al1\u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65N (commonly ScAlN, or AlScN) was strongly motivated by its use in radio-frequency (RF) acoustic signal processing systems, since with increasing ScN fraction (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\u2192 0.43) the piezoelectric response of wurtzite ScAlN is up to five times that of AlN [1-6]. ScAlN-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have been used successfully as ultrasonic transducers [7], RF surface and bulk acoustic wave (SAW, BAW) resonators and filters [8-10], and sensors [11]. Ferroelectricity was recently demonstrated in ScAlN [12], leading to strong interest in ScAlN for switching and memory applications [13-18]. Strong optical non-linearities in ScAlN are being investigated, with a goal of developing photonic devices and circuits [19-21]. For a majority of these piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and photonic applications, the deposition method of choice has been sputtering [4, 12, 22]. For MEMS-driven development, the primary goal was to achieve c-axis oriented polycrystalline films with the highest stable ScN fraction and the strongest piezoelectric performance, while retaining film texture, low roughness, low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOGs), low stress, and compatibility with MEMS process flows. Recently, process development of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for the growth of single-crystal ScAlN on GaN, SiC, Si, or epitaxial transition metal nitride (TMN) metallic surfaces has enabled lattice-matched ScAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with promising current density, output power density, and RF characteristics [23-26]. MBE ScAlN can also be used for MEMS and ferroelectric applications: SAW/BAW resonators operating at frequencies up to 110 GHz have been reported [27-32], and ferroelectric behavior has been demonstrated [25]. Depending on the technique used, a variety of growth/deposition environments and growth kinetics are expected, likely resulting in very different microstructure and properties for the ScAlN film [26, 33-37]. Quantifying and understanding the causal or correlative technique-structure-property relationships will be critical for material development and future applications."
