  "abstract": ". Shape optimization involves the minimization of a cost func- tion defined over a set of shapes, often governed by a partial differential equation (PDE). In the absence of closed-form solutions, one relies on numerical methods to approximate the solution. The level set method\u2014 when coupled with the finite element method\u2014is one of the most ver- satile numerical shape optimization approaches but still suffers from the limitations of most mesh-based methods. In this work, we present a fully meshless level set framework that leverages neural networks to parame- terize the level set function and employs the graph Laplacian to approxi- mate the underlying PDE. Our approach enables precise computations of geometric quantities such as surface normals and curvature, and allows tackling optimization problems within the class of convex shapes.

In the majority of shape optimization prob- lems, the function J depends on the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) posed on the domain. In most cases including industrial applications, an exact solution to (1) cannot be found and a numerical approximation must be sought. Among the many different numerical shape optimization methods, one of the most versatile approaches is the level set method [17]. Contrary to classical methods based on mesh deformation, the level set method represents shapes \u2126\u2208A as the 0-sublevel set of a function, which has the advantage to allow for topology changes in the course of the optimization process. However, it also introduces new difficulties, like the need of an ersatz material, i.e., an arXiv:2502.14821v1 [math.NA] 20 Feb 2025"
