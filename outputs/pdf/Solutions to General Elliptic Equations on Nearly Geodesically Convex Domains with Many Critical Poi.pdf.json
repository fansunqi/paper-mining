  "abstract": ". Consider a complete d-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g), a point p \u2208M and a nonlinearity f(q, u) with f(p, 0) > 0. We prove that for any odd integer N \u22653, there exists a sequence of smooth domains \u2126k \u2282 M containing p and corresponding positive solutions uk : \u2126k \u2192R+ to the Dirichlet boundary problem ( \u2212\u2206guk = f(\u00b7, uk) in \u2126k , uk = 0 on \u2202\u2126k . All these solutions have exactly N critical points in \u2126k (specifically, (N +1)/2 nondegenerate maxima and (N\u22121)/2 nondegenerate saddles), and the domains \u2126k are star-shaped with respect to p and become \u201cnearly convex\u201d, in a precise sense, as k \u2192+\u221e. 1. Introduction The calculation of the number of critical points of solutions to the equation \u2212\u2206gu = f(u) has long been a topic of significant interest among mathematicians. Although a substantial body of literature exists on this subject, many challenges remain unresolved, and several open problems appear to be far from a definitive solution. In this paper we consider the problem (1.1) ( \u2212\u2206gu = f(q, u) in \u2126 u = 0 on \u2202\u2126 where \u2126\u2282M is a bounded smooth domain, M is a complete d-dimensional Rie- mannian manifold, possibly non compact, and \u2206g is the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator on M. Here f(q, u) is a Lipschitz function on M \u00d7 R. Despite its seemingly simple structure, this problem is surprisingly rich in in- triguing properties. It is well known that the number of critical points of (1.1) is strongly influenced by both the topology and the geometry of \u2126(see, for instance, the classic Poincar\u00e9\u2013Hopf Theorem). Let us begin by providing a brief historical overview of the problem, starting with the flat case, that is, M = Rd with d \u22652, equipped with its natural metric. In this context the most general result is undoubtedly the breakthrough theorem of Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg. In the influential paper [9], it was proven that if \u2126is a domain which is convex with respect to the directions x1, .., xd, symmetric with respect to the axes x1, .., xd, and if the nonlinearity is autonomous (i.e., f(x, u) \u2261F(u)), then the solution has a unique critical point located at the center of symmetry of \u2126. 2010 Mathematics Subject classification:35B09,35B40,35Q,35J,35R01.
