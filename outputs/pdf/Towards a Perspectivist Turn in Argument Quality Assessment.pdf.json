  "title": "Towards a Perspectivist Turn in Argument Quality Assessment.pdf",
  "abstract": "The assessment of argument quality depends on well-established logical, rhetorical, and dialec- tical properties that are unavoidably subjective: multiple valid assessments may exist, there is no unequivocal ground truth. This aligns with recent paths in machine learning, which em- brace the co-existence of different perspectives. However, this potential remains largely unex- plored in NLP research on argument quality. One crucial reason seems to be the yet unex- plored availability of suitable datasets. We fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of argument quality datasets. We assign them to a multi-layered categorization targeting two as- pects: (a) What has been annotated: we collect the quality dimensions covered in datasets and consolidate them in an overarching taxonomy, increasing dataset comparability and interop- erability. (b) Who annotated: we survey what information is given about annotators, enabling perspectivist research and grounding our rec- ommendations for future actions. To this end, we discuss datasets suitable for developing per- spectivist models (i.e., those containing indi- vidual, non-aggregated annotations), and we showcase the importance of a controlled selec- tion of annotators in a pilot study. 1 Introduction The question of \u201cwhat makes an argument good\u201d is at the core of computational argumentation (CA), the area of natural language processing (NLP) deal- ing with the mining, assessment, and generation of arguments (Stede and Schneider, 2019; Lauscher et al., 2022). While rooted in well-established theo- ries, argument quality (AQ) still exhibits a high de- gree of subjectivity in perception. This degree may vary across quality aspects; for example, evaluating an argument\u2019s benefit in agreement-seeking discus- sions is considered less subjective than assessing its effectiveness (Wachsmuth et al., 2017b). The CA community is aware of the variance in annotators\u2019 perception (Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Teruel et al., 2018; Hautli-Janisz et al., 2022). Not least, this is documented by the generally moderate inter-annotator agreement in AQ annotations \u2014 a widely accepted condition that authors commonly attribute to the subjective nature of the task (e.g., Wachsmuth et al. 2017b; Gretz et al. 2020; Ng et al. 2020; Ziegenbein et al. 2023).1 Wachsmuth and Werner (2020) explicitly question whether an aggregated ground truth is suitable to model AQ. Meanwhile, the NLP community has started to undergo a fundamental change in the way it deals with subjective tasks. While aggregated ground truth and an according model alignment were long standard, more recent work calls for this course to be reconsidered (Basile, 2020; Plank, 2022; Cabitza et al., 2023; Frenda et al., 2024): Rather than eradicating any existence of annotator dis- agreement, the perspectivist turn embraces the co- existence of perspectives (Uma et al., 2021a; Da- vani et al., 2022; Leonardelli et al., 2023). This transformation implies the acceptance of varia- tions in data annotation (through non-aggregated datasets) as well as the consideration of heterogene- ity in modeling and evaluation (Uma et al., 2021b; Basile et al., 2021; Plank, 2022). We postulate that the perspectivist turn in NLP lends itself as a natural solution to face the issue of subjectivity in modeling AQ. Not only does it have a better shot at promoting diversity and fairness in AQ assessment, such as allowing for valid but minority voices (Noble, 2012; Prabhakaran et al., 2021). It is also likely to be more robust in model- ing perceptions of AQ across (changing) societies (e.g., today\u2019s minority groups may become tomor- row\u2019s majority) and target audiences. Yet, the perspectivist turn so far had only mini- mal impact on AQ. Presumably, one reason for the limited modeling of perspectives in AQ is the lack of datasets designed for this purpose. Preference 1Certainly, not all disagreement is due to subjectivity. We refer the reader to the Limitations section for a discussion. 1 arXiv:2502.14501v1 [cs.CL] 20 Feb 2025"
