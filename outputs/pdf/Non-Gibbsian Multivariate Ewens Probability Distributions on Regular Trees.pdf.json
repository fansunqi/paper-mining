  "title": "Non-Gibbsian Multivariate Ewens Probability Distributions on Regular Trees.pdf",
  "abstract": ". Ewens\u2019 sampling formula (ESF) provides the probability distribution governing the number of distinct genetic types and their respective frequencies at a selectively neutral locus under the in\ufb01nitely-many-alleles model of mutation. A natural and signi\ufb01cant question arises: \u201cIs the Ewens probability distribution on regular trees Gibbsian?\u201d In this paper, we demonstrate that Ewens probability distributions can be re- garded as non-Gibbsian distributions on regular trees and derive a su\ufb03cient con- dition for the consistency condition. This study lays the groundwork for a new direction in the theory of non-Gibbsian probability distributions on trees.

Introduction The rigorous implementation of real-space renormalization group (RG) transfor- mations as mappings on Hamiltonians encountered signi\ufb01cant mathematical chal- lenges over three decades ago. These issues were \ufb01rst highlighted by Gri\ufb03ths and Pearce [1] and later attributed by van Enter, Fern\u00b4andez, and Sokal to the emer- gence of non-Gibbsian measures under RG transformations, rendering the mappings ill-de\ufb01ned at the level of Hamiltonians [2]. This discovery spurred extensive research on non-Gibbsianness and its implica- tions, with notable contributions from van Enter, Fern\u00b4andez, Sokal [2], L\u00a8orinczi [3], van de Velde [4], and others [5\u20138, 10, 11]. Subsequent work identi\ufb01ed non-Gibbsian measures in transient regimes of interacting particle systems, including stochastic Ising models, where in\ufb01nite-temperature dynamics were viewed as single-site sto- chastic RG mappings [9]. Dobrushin\u2019s program further developed a generalized Gibbsian framework, inves- tigating which traditional Gibbsian properties could persist. Non-Gibbsianness in disordered systems and other contexts was also systematically explored. In 2003, 1"
