  "abstract": ". We establish an explicit uniform a priori estimate for weak solutions to slightly subcritical elliptic problems with nonlin- earities simultaneously at the interior and on the boundary. Our explicit L\u221e(\u2126) a priori estimates are in terms of powers of their H1(\u2126) norms. To prove our result, we combine a De Giorgi-Nash- Moser\u2019s iteration scheme together with elliptic regularity and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg\u2019s interpolation inequality.

Introduction Let us consider the boundary value problem with nonlinear boundary conditions (1.1) \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 \u2212\u2206u + u =f(x, u), x \u2208\u2126, \u2202u \u2202\u03b7 =fB(x, u), x \u2208\u2202\u2126, where \u2126\u2282RN, (N > 2), is an open, connected, bounded domain with C2 boundary, \u2202/\u2202\u03b7 = \u03b7 \u00b7 \u2207is the (unit) outer normal derivative, and the functions f : \u2126\u00d7 R \u2192R, and fB : \u2202\u2126\u00d7 R \u2192R, are both slightly subcritical Carath\u00e9odory functions. We give in (f1)-(f2) and (fB1)- (fB2) the precise statement of the hypothesis on the nonlinearities at the interior, and on the boundary respectively.
