  "title": "Exact Height Distribution in One-Dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson Interface with Diffusing Diffusivity.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We study the height distribution of a one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface in the presence of a stochastic diffusivity D(t) = B2(t), where B(t) represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time t. The height distribution at a fixed point in space is computed analytically. The typical height h(x, t) at a given point in space is found to scale as t3/4 and the distribution G(H) of the scaled height H = h/t3/4 is symmetric but with a nontrivial shape: while it approaches a nonzero constant quadratically as H \u21920, it has a non-Gaussian tail that decays exponentially for large H. We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole family of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent z > 1, with z = 2 corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model. arXiv:2502.01153v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 3 Feb 2025"
