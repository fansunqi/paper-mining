  "title": "Simple Numerical Scheme for Solving the Impregnation Equations in a Porous Pellet.pdf",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a numerical scheme for solving a system of convection- reaction-diffusion equations describing the process of preparing a catalyst on a porous support by the impregnation method. In the case of a considered porous spherical pellet, the equations are defined on an interval, one end of which, associated with the front of the impregnating liquid, moves according to a given law. The law of front motion is used to create a consistent space- time grid for discretizing the system. Examples of numerical solutions of the impregnation problem are given, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Keywords: catalysts preparation modeling, impregnation equations, sperical pellet, numerical solution 1. Introduction The process of impregnating porous pellets with a solution containing catalytically active elements is a widely used technique for the preparation of supported catalysts [1]. Active elements from the solution are adsorbed onto the pore surface, forming a catalytically active surface of large area. The impregnation process is modelled by an initial boundary value problem for a system of partial differential equations in a domain with a moving boundary [2, 3, 4, 5]. \u2217Corresponding author Email address: peskovnick@gmail.com (N.V.
