  "abstract": "In the classic cop and robber game, two players\u2013the cop and the robber\u2013take turns moving to a neighboring vertex or staying at their current position. The cop aims to capture the robber, while the robber tries to evade capture. A graph G is called a cop-win graph if the cop can always capture the robber in a \ufb01nite number of moves. In the cop and robber game with radius of capture k, the cop wins if he can come within distance k of the robber. The radius capture number rc(G) of a graph G is the smallest k for which the cop has a winning strategy in this variant of the game. In this paper, we establish that rc(H) \u2264rc(G) for any retract H of G. We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the radius capture number in terms of the graph\u2019s radius and girth, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the radius capture number in vertex-transitive graphs and identify several families F of vertex-transitive graphs with rc(G) = rad(G) \u22121 for any G \u2208F. We further study the radius capture number in outerplanar graphs, Sierpi\u00b4nski graphs, harmonic even graphs, and graph products. Speci\ufb01cally, we show that for any outerplanar graph G, rc(G) depends on the size of its largest inner face. For harmonic even graphs and Sierpi\u00b4nski graphs S(n, 3), we prove that rc(G) = rad(G) \u22121. Regarding graph products, we determine exact values of the radius capture number for strong and lexicographic products, showing that they depend on the radius capture numbers of their factors. Lastly, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the radius capture number of the Cartesian product of two graphs.
