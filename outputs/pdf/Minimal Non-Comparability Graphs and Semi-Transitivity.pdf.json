  "abstract": ". The concept of word-representable graphs has been widely explored in the literature. The class of word-representable graphs is char- acterized by the existence of a semi-transitive orientation. Speci\ufb01cally, a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits such an orienta- tion. Comparability graphs form a subclass of word-representable graphs. Both word-representable and comparability graphs belong to hereditary graph classes. Every hereditary class can be characterized in terms of their forbidden induced subgraphs. The minimal forbidden induced sub- graphs of comparability graphs and word-representable graphs are re- ferred to as minimal non-comparability graphs and minimal non-word- representable graphs, respectively. While the complete set of minimal non-comparability graphs is known, identifying the set of all minimal non-word-representable graphs remains an open problem. In this paper, we precisely determine the set of all min- imal non-comparability graphs that are minimal non-word-representable graphs as well. To achieve this, we categorize all minimal non-comparability graphs into those that are semi-transitive and those that are not. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our classi\ufb01cation, we establish a charac- terization and a complete list of minimal non-word-representable graphs that contain an all-adjacent vertex. This is accomplished by introduc- ing an all-adjacent vertex to each minimal non-comparability graph that is semi-transitive. As a result of our study, we identify several in\ufb01nite families of minimal non-word-representable graphs, expanding the un- derstanding of their structural properties.

These are graphs whose edges can be oriented such that for any three vertices x, y, and z, if there is a directed edge from x to y and from y to z, then a directed edge from x to z"
