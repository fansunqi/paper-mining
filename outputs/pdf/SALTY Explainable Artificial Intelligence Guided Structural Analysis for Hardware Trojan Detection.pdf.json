  "abstract": "\u2014Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications in digital designs that can be inserted by untrusted supply chain entities. Hardware Trojans can give rise to diverse attack vectors such as information leakage (e.g. MOLES Trojan) and denial- of-service (rarely triggered bit flip). Such an attack in critical systems (e.g. healthcare and aviation) can endanger human lives and lead to catastrophic financial loss. Several techniques have been developed to detect such malicious modifications in digital designs, particularly for designs sourced from third-party intellectual property (IP) vendors. However, most techniques have scalability concerns (due to unsound assumptions during evaluation) and lead to large number of false positive detections (false alerts). Our framework (SALTY) mitigates these concerns through the use of a novel Graph Neural Network architecture (using Jumping-Knowledge mechanism) for generating initial predictions and an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach for fine tuning the outcomes (post-processing). Ex- periments show > 98% True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across a large set of standard benchmarks.

INTRODUCTION The global distributed supply chain has a massive economic advantage but suffers from security and trust concerns. Most modern semiconductor companies operate in a fabless model, including economic giants such as NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, Qualcomm, and Broadcom that are driving the current AI wave. Most small semiconductor business are following the same example set by these larger companies. Most of these companies often acquire/license application-specific design blocks (also called IPs) from third-party vendors around the world, integrate these IPs into their core design, and send the final design to other entities for fabrication/testing/packaging. This distributed model opens up the system to a variety of threat vectors such as hardware Trojans, intellectual property theft, and privacy compromise through reverse engineering. In this study, we focus on hardware Trojans which are intentional malicious modifications in digital designs that can lead to certain non-characteristic behavior of the system in- field [1]. Such attacks can be carried out by malicious third- party IP vendors (3PIP), rogue employees in the design house, and an untrusted foundry. Typically hardware Trojans have a very small footprint (compared to the original design) in terms of area/power/delay and are rarely triggered during the system testing phase. Hence, it is a difficult task to detect these modifications in massive digital designs. Recent works such as VIPR [2], [3] and TrojanSAINT [4] have attempted to detect these Trojans in digital designs using different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with varying degrees of success. VIPR suffers from low True Positive Rate (TPR) while TrojanSAINT has massive instability issues (performs poorly on certain designs). The post-processing techniques introduced in VIPR are inspiring, but lack dynamism and flexibility. Other techniques such as GNN4Gate [5], FAST- GO [6], NHTD [7] have major scalability/practicality concerns because of unsound evaluation choices (trained and tested on similar benchmark structures). In this work, we propose SALTY (Structural AI for Explainable Trojan Analysis), a novel hardware Trojan detec- tion framework (golden free) that attempts to mitigate the con- cerns and shortcomings of existing frameworks. SALTY uti- lizes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Jumping Knowledge (JK) mechanism while leveraging design structural features similar to SAIL [8] (a reverse engineering frame- work). The JK-mechanism reduces the risk of over-smoothing by aggregating hidden layer embeddings. This allows the model to attain a much higher TPR and TNR compared to other state-of-the-art GNNs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical models are often not fully aware of the domain constraints and make irrational decisions (hallucination) lead- ing to poor performance. To tackle this concern, we utilize explainability techniques to draw insights about when and how our AI models fail to make correct decisions. This insight allows us to build a dynamic post-processing module that can further enhance the performance of SALTY. We evaluate our framework on a large set of standard TrustHub benchmarks (> 15) and compare the results against seven other state- of-the-art (SOTA) Trojan detection techniques. We observe significant performance improvements (TPR/TNR combined) and enhanced visibility into the Trojan detection process (via explainability). In particular, we make the following contributions: 1) Designed a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes Jumping Knowledge (JK) mechanism for efficient hidden layer embedding aggregation. 2) Developed a novel explainability guided dynamic post- processing module that can boost Trojan detection per- formance by removing hallucinations. \u00a9 This paper has been accepted for publication at 43rd IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS), 2025 arXiv:2502.14116v1 [cs.CR] 19 Feb 2025"
