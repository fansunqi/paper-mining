  "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an explicit extension formula in sensitivity analysis regarding the Malliavin weight for jump-diffusion mean-field stochastic differ- ential equations whose local Lipschitz drift coefficients are influenced by the product of the solution and its law. We state that these extended equations have unique Malliavin differentiable solutions in the Wiener-Poisson space and establish the sensitivity analysis of path-dependent discontinuous payoff functions. It will be realized after finding a relation between the stochastic flow of the solutions and their derivatives. The Malliavin derivatives are de- fined in a chaos approach that the chain rule is not held. The convergence of the Euler method to approximate Delta Greek is proved. The simula- tion experiment illustrates our results to compute the Delta, in the context of financial mathematics, and demonstrates that the Malliavin Monte-Carlo computations applied in our formula are more efficient than using the finite difference method directly. Keywords: Mean-field SDEs, Malliavin calculus, Delta, Jump diffusion processes 1. Introduction In 1999, Fourni\u00b4e et al. [1] introduced the Greeks criteria using Malliavin cal- culus on the Wiener space. They demonstrated that the convergence rate of their method is more efficient than the finite difference method, particularly for discontinuous payoff functions. This innovative technique has since been applied by various researchers across different models. Here are some exam- ples of what has been done.
