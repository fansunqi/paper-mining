  "abstract": ". We revisit the classical problem of denoising a one-dimensional scalar-valued function by minimizing the sum of an L2 \ufb01delity term and the total variation, scaled by a regularization parameter. This study focuses on proving that the jump set of solutions, corresponding to discontinuities or edges, as well as the amplitude of the jumps are nonincreasing as the regularization parameter increases. Our results apply to input functions in L\u221ewith left and right approximate limits everywhere, extending beyond the traditional setting of functions of bounded variation. The proof leverages competitor con- structions and convexity properties of the taut string problem, a well-known equivalent formulation of the TV model. Such a monotonicity property re\ufb02ects that the extent to which geometric and topological features of the original signal are preserved is consistent with the amount of smoothing desired when formulating the denoising method. 1. Introduction The Total Variation (TV) model is a cornerstone of signal and image denoising due to its ability to reduce noise while preserving sharp edges. By minimizing a balance between the total variation and a \ufb01delity term, typically measured in terms of an L2 norm, the TV model e\ufb00ectively smooths \ufb02at regions without blurring important images\u2019 features, such as object boundaries, which makes it particularly suitable for applications where maintaining sharp geometric and topological characteristics is critical. Since proposed by Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi [30], the TV model, also known as the ROF model, has inspired extensive research, including theoretical studies on the regularization properties [1, 10, 23], e\ufb03- cient numerical algorithms [9, 12], and extensions to anisotropic [20, 27] and higher-order formulations [5]. These developments underscore the versatility and impact of the TV model in both theory and practice. A fundamental question associated with the TV and other denoising models is the study of the structure of their solutions\u2019 jump set, i.e., the points where discontinuities occur corresponding to edges or abrupt changes in signals. This study is key in the theoretical understanding of the regularization\u2019s role in signal processing and image analysis, aligning closely with practical applications in signal processing, where preserving or controlling edge structures is paramount. Considerable attention has been given to the one-dimensional case, where the so-called taut string formulation o\ufb00ers a powerful lens to study solutions to the TV model. This is based on the equivalence between the TV and the taut string problems (see Problems 1.1 and 2.1 below). The latter consists in the minimization of the length of the graph of a function with \ufb01xed boundary conditions and bilateral inequality constraints given by shifted versions of an input function. This equivalence is by now well known, having been recognized in the discrete setting since [16], and used in the discretization of signal processing problems [22, 13] as well as in the continuum setting [19], with generalizations to more general constraints in [21] and weighted total variation in [4]. In this work, we further explore the equivalence between the two aforementioned problems to prove monotonicity properties of the jump set of the solutions to the TV model in the one-dimensional setting, which ensure that the locations of discontinuities (edges) in the denoised image align with the original image\u2019s structure. This key property helps maintaining the geometric and topological integrity of the image features, leading to more accurate and visually pleasing denoising results. Our purpose is twofold. First, we address the question of how increasing the regularization parameter, \u03b1 (see (1.1) below), simpli\ufb01es the solution by progressively eliminating jumps and reducing their amplitude, thereby sharpening the correspondence between input signal features and regularized solutions.
