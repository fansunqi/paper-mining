  "abstract": "Finding the optimal (revenue-maximizing) mechanism to sell multiple items has been a prominent and notoriously difficult open problem. Existing work has mainly focused on deriving analytical results tailored to a particular class of problems (for example, Giannakopoulos (2015) and Yang (2023)). The present paper explores the possibility of a generally applicable methodology of the Automated Mechanism Design (AMD). We first employ the deep learning algorithm developed by D\u00a8utting et al. (2023) to numerically solve small-sized problems, and the results are then generalized by educated guesswork and finally rigorously verified through duality. By focusing on a single buyer who can consume one item, our approach leads to two key contributions: establishing a much simpler way to verify the optimality of a wide range of problems and discovering a completely new result about the optimality of grand bundling. First, we show that selling each item at an identical price (or equivalently, selling the grand bundle of all items) is optimal for any number of items when the value distributions belong to a class that includes the uniform distribution as a special case. Different items are allowed to have different distributions. Second, for each number of items, we established necessary and sufficient conditions that c must satisfy for grand bundling to be optimal when the value distribution is uniform over an interval [c, c + 1]. This latter model does not satisfy the previously known sufficient conditions for the optimality of grand bundling Haghpanah and Hartline (2021). Our results are in contrast to the only known results for n items (for any n), Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017), which consider a single buyer with additive preferences, where the values of items are narrowly restricted to i.i.d. according to a uniform or exponential distribution. 1 Introduction The optimal auction design problem is an important yet notoriously difficult open question in economic theory. It considers the revenue-maximizing selling procedure when buyers\u2019 willingness to pay is private information. The seminal work Myerson (1981) solved the problem of selling a single item, but for more than 40 years, the optimal mechanism for multiple items has not been known. Even when there is one buyer, we are yet to obtain a general result. The only known results for the one-buyer and arbitrary number of items (for any n-item) case are Giannakopoulos (2015), Daskalakis et al. (2017), Haghpanah and Hartline (2021), and Yang (2023). Giannakopoulos (2015) and Daskalakis et al. (2017) considered a buyer with additive preferences, where the value of a set of items is the sum of the values of each item and derived the optimal mechanism when the values of items are i.i.d. according to a particular distribution. Haghpanah and Hartline (2021) covers broader settings but relies on conditions that are not easy to check in practice. Similarly, Yang (2023) provides a general result, but their approach is limited to a one-dimensional type space, reducing its applicability to more complex multi-dimensional scenarios. In summary, results that apply to cases with an arbitrary number of goods are quite rare, and even when they exist, they hold only under limited settings. Furthermore, although they show sufficiency conditions for a specific mechanism to be optimal, it remains unsolved whether those conditions are also necessary. The necessary condition Haghpanah and Hartline (2021) showed is partial inverse. Although Daskalakis et al. (2017) showed a necessary and sufficient condition for grand bundling to be optimal, that condition \u2217We would like to thank Michihiro Kandori for his guidance and comments. \u2020The Faculty of Economics, the University of Tokyo, Japan.
