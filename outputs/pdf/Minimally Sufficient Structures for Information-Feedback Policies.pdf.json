  "abstract": ". In this paper, we consider robotic tasks which require a de- sirable outcome to be achieved in the physical world that the robot is embedded in and interacting with. Accomplishing this objective requires designing a filter that maintains a useful representation of the physical world and a policy over the filter states. A filter is seen as the robot\u2019s perspective of the physical world based on limited sensing, memory, and computation and it is represented as a transition system over a space of information states. To this end, the interactions result from the coupling of an internal and an external system, a filter, and the physical world, respectively, through a sensor mapping and an information-feedback pol- icy. Within this setup, we look for sufficient structures, that is, sufficient internal systems and sensors, for accomplishing a given task. We estab- lish necessary and sufficient conditions for these structures to satisfy for information-feedback policies that can be defined over the states of an internal system to exist. We also show that under mild assumptions, minimal internal systems that can represent a particular plan/policy de- scribed over the action-observation histories exist and are unique. Finally, the results are applied to determine sufficient structures for distance- optimal navigation in a polygonal environment.

Given a well-defined task structure and a particular robot hardware, solving this problem typically requires designing a filter and a policy over the filter states. Therefore, whether filters and policies are designed by engineers, computed, or learned, we argue that these two structures should be analyzed and designed together. \u22c6This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant (ERC AdG, ILLUSIVE: Foundations of Perception Engineering, 101020977), Academy of Finland (projects CHiMP 342556 and BANG! 363637). arXiv:2502.13852v1 [cs.RO] 19 Feb 2025"
