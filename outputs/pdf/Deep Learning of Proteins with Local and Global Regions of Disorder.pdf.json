  "abstract": "Although machine learning has transformed protein structure prediction of folded protein ground states with remarkable accuracy, intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs/IDRs) are defined by diverse and dynamical structural ensembles that are predicted with low confidence by algorithms such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold. We present a new machine learning method, IDPForge (Intrinsically Disordered Protein, FOlded and disordered Region GEnerator), that exploits a transformer protein language diffusion model to create all-atom IDP ensembles and IDR disordered ensembles that maintains the folded domains. IDPForge does not require sequence-specific training, back transformations from coarse-grained representations, nor ensemble reweighting, as in general the created IDP/IDR conformational ensembles show good agreement with solution experimental data, and options for biasing with experimental restraints are provided if desired. We envision that IDPForge with these diverse capabilities will facilitate integrative and structural studies for proteins that contain intrinsic disorder, and is available as an open source resource for general use. 1 arXiv:2502.11326v1 [q-bio.BM] 17 Feb 2025"
