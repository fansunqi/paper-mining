  "title": "A New Prescription for the Spectral Properties of Population III Stellar Populations.pdf",
  "abstract": "We investigated various emission properties of extremely low metallicity stellar populations in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), using the new GALSEVN model, which has shown promising agreement between spectral predictions and observations at lower redshifts and higher metallicities. We find that emission-line diagnostics previously proposed to discriminate between population III (Pop III) stars and other primordial ionizing sources are effective, but only for stellar-population ages below \u223c1 Myr. We provide other key quantities relevant to modeling Pop III stellar populations in the EoR, such as the production efficiency of ionizing photons, which is critical for reionization studies, the production rate of Lyman-Werner photons, which can dissociate H2 and influence the efficiency of star formation, and the rates of different types of supernov\u00e6, offering insights into the timescales of chemical enrichment in metal- poor environments. We complement our study with a self-consistent investigation of the gravitational-wave signals generated by the mergers of binary black holes that formed through stellar evolution and their detectability. The results presented here provide valuable predictions for the study of the EoR, on the crucial role of low-metallicity stellar populations in reionization mechanisms and star formation, as well as meaningful insights into potential observational counterparts to direct detections of Pop III stars.

Introduction One of the most fundamental yet still largely unexplored phases in the history of our Universe is the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), corresponding to the complex phase transition from an essentially neutral to an almost fully ionized state for intergalac- tic gas in the redshift range 5 <\u223cz <\u223c20 (e.g., Dayal & Fer- rara 2018; Bosman et al. 2022; Robertson 2022; Padmanabhan & Loeb 2024). The approximate scenario of reionization, based on the idea that the first light-emitting objects ionize their im- mediate surroundings and create expanding ionized bubbles, is straightforward in principle, but still suffers from significant sim- plifications and unresolved issues. One of the main uncertainties lies in determining the mechanisms controlling the formation of the first luminous objects. The main sources of ionizing photons in the EoR are thought to be the first generations of massive stars in nascent galaxies (e.g., Madau et al. 1999; Bouwens et al. 2015; Robertson 2022). The very first stars to form presumably were massive (up to \u223c1000 M\u2299; e.g., Schauer et al. 2020), nearly metal-free, exotic population III (hereafter simply Pop III) stars. Their very short lifetimes and the associated short timescales of chemical en- richment meant that more metal-rich, population II (Pop II) stars probably quickly took control of the emission in most primeval galaxies (e.g., Bromm & Larson 2004). Yet, recent studies have shown that Pop III star formation could have persisted down to redshifts z \u223c6 (e.g., Mebane et al. 2018; Hartwig et al. 2022; Venditti et al. 2023). Other sources are likely to have contributed significantly to the reionization of the Universe, in particular, active galactic nuclei (AGNs; e.g., Wang et al. 2010; Parsa et al. 2018; Harikane et al. 2023; Maiolino et al. 2024a) and accre- tion disks of putative, direct-collapse black holes (DHCBs; e.g., Begelman et al. 2006; Inayoshi et al. 2020). Understanding the radiative properties of young, extremely metal-poor stellar popu- lations in their pristine environment is therefore key to constrain- ing the role played by primeval galaxies as drivers of reioniza- tion. Recent activity in this field has been boosted by the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has col- lected spectra of galaxies out to redshifts z \u223c14, well into the EoR (e.g., Curtis-Lake et al. 2023; Fujimoto et al. 2024; Car- niani et al. 2024; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2024), as well as by growing efforts to understand the influence of the first stellar generations on the timing and depth of the cosmological 21-cm signal (e.g., Mirocha et al. 2018; Mebane et al. 2020; Gessey- Article number, page 1 of 15 arXiv:2502.14028v1 [astro-ph.GA] 19 Feb 2025"
