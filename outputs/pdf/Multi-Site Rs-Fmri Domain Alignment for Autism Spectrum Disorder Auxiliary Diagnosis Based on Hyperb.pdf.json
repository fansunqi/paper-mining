  "title": "Multi-Site Rs-Fmri Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperb.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014 In the medical field, most resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data are collected from multiple hospital sites. Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain dis- eases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxil- iary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adapta- tion algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain- adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corre- sponding hyperbolic space community network to effec- tively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Addi- tionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnos- tic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the pro- posed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis.

ASD typically emerges in childhood, with lifelong symptoms that often require long- term support [3]. The main characteristics of ASD include social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive be- haviors, with severity ranging from mild to profound [4]. Although there is currently no specific medication for treat- ing ASD, early and accurate diagnosis and intervention are considered the most effective approach. However, existing diagnostic methods\u2014such as questionnaires and behavioral observation\u2014are subjective and influenced by environmental factors, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more accurate diagnostic methods and the identification of additional biomarkers to aid in diagnosis. With the rapid development of medical imaging technology, tools for analyzing neurophysiology have become increasingly important. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique [5] that measures Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal changes due to neuronal activity across the brain at various time points [6]. Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to explore brain network interactions in patients with psychiatric disorders. In recent years, numerous researchers have combined deep learning techniques with rs-fMRI to explore psychiatric disorders, achieving significant results [7], [8]. Most studies use pre- defined brain templates to divide the brain into regions of interest (ROIs), obtain the BOLD time series of these ROIs, and then compute the correlations between the time series to construct functional connectivity networks (FCNs), enabling brain activity analysis [9], [10]. In ASD diagnosis using rs-fMRI data, researchers often integrate datasets from multiple medical centers to address the scarcity of training data [11]. However, due to the hetero- geneity in equipment, scanning parameters, and data charac- teristics across different medical centers, there are significant differences in the data distributions between centers, leading to the domain shift problem [12]. This discrepancy severely limits the generalization ability of models, especially when diagnostic labels are absent for data from certain medical cen- ters, making traditional supervised learning methods difficult to apply directly. To address this issue, Domain Adaptation (DA) [13] techniques have emerged. The goal of DA is to enable knowledge transfer from the source domain to the target domain through techniques like feature alignment, thereby arXiv:2502.05493v1 [q-bio.NC] 8 Feb 2025"
