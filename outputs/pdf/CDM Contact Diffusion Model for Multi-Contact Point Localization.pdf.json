  "abstract": "\u2014 In this paper, we propose a Contact Diffusion Model (CDM), a novel learning-based approach for multi- contact point localization. We consider a robot equipped with joint torque sensors and a force/torque sensor at the base. By leveraging a diffusion model, CDM addresses the singularity where multiple pairs of contact points and forces produce identical sensor measurements. We formulate CDM to be conditioned on past model outputs to account for the time-dependent characteristics of the multi-contact scenarios. Moreover, to effectively address the complex shape of the robot surfaces, we incorporate the signed distance field in the denoising process. Consequently, CDM can localize contacts at arbitrary locations with high accuracy. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, CDM operates at 15.97ms and, in the real world, achieves an error of 0.44cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24cm in dual-contact scenarios. I. INTRODUCTION Bringing robots into our daily lives presents many chal- lenges. In addition to efforts such as autonomous task execution [1], [2], another key focus is improving robots\u2019 physical interaction capabilities to effectively handle unex- pected collisions or contacts. For example, [3]\u2013[7] propose compliant control methods that allow robots to safely inter- act with unknown environments or humans. Other studies focus on rapidly detecting collisions for safety purposes [8]\u2013[11]. Several works have introduced contact localization methods to explicitly find contact points [12]\u2013[16]. Notably, [12] and [16] specifically address multi-contact scenarios. Optimization-based control schemes have been presented to close the feedback loop using contact estimation results. [17] addressed single-contact scenarios, while [18], [19] addressed multi-contact scenarios. Our research contributes to this area by proposing a method for multi-contact localization (e.g., localizing r1 and r2 in Fig. 1). Similar to our previous work [12], we consider a collaborative robot equipped with proprioceptive sensors, specifically joint torque sensors (JTSs) and a force/torque (F/T) sensor at the base; see Fig. 1. A.

The objective of this paper is to localize the contact points (ri \u2208R3) by leveraging a diffusion model, where the denoising process is conditioned on proprioceptive sensor measurements, including JTSs and a base F/T sensor. The green colored points represent the samples generated by the proposed method. studied. Learning-based methods, such as those introduced in [20], [21], formulate the contact localization problem as a classification. In this approach, pre-labeled points on the robot are classified into contact/non-contact categories. Additionally, in [21], the location of contact is parameterized as a value between 0 and 1 (from the base to the end- effector). The aforementioned works simplified the robot surface; that is, they formulated the problem so that the solution corresponds to a point on the robot surface. This is due to (i) the kinematic relationships changing non- linearly with joint angles and (ii) the surface geometry being complex. In contrast, model-based approaches, such as particle filter (PF)-based algorithms [12]\u2013[16], handle surface constraints more effectively. Several methods have been proposed to keep particles representing the contact point constrained to the robot\u2019s surface. For example, in [12]\u2013[15], mesh data is used to represent the positions of particles, while in [16], particles are projected onto the robot surface. With this setup, the particles are updated and resampled to find the contact location that best explains the sensor measurements, using the error metric defined via a quadratic programming (QP). For both learning-based and PF-based approaches, singu- larity remains as a challenge. In contact localization prob- lems, singularity occurs when multiple pairs of contact points and force vectors result in the same sensor measurements. In this case, there exist multiple solutions for contact localiza- arXiv:2502.06109v1 [cs.RO] 10 Feb 2025"
