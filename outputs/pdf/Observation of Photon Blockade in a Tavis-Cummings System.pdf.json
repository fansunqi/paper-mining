The effect is characterized with photon number-resolving spectroscopy using an additional dispersively coupled transmon \u201cwitness\u201d qubit to directly probe the cavity\u2019s photon number distribution. We first observe polariton formation with splitting proportional to \u221a N, confirming the Tavis-Cummings coupling, and subsequently obtain sub-Poissonian cavity photon statistics when the cavity is driven at polariton frequencies. I. INTRODUCTION Photon-photon interactions are notoriously absent in nature except within media that exhibit optical non- linearity \u2013 the phenomenology explored in classical and quantum optics alike. At the end of the 20th century, sci- entists studied Kerr and Kerr-like nonlinearities for ap- plications in photon logic and single-photon turnstile de- vices. Among these works was the theory of photon block- ade (PB), where the absorption of one photon blocks the transmission of a subsequent photon [1]. Its experimental realizations in atomic, quantum dot and superconducting Kerr and Jaynes-Cummings systems followed [2\u20135]. Next came observations of the unconventional photon block- ade in solid state systems, which eased the conditions for demonstrating PB effect toward weakly (as opposed to strongly) interacting oscillators [6, 7]. Photon blockade has recently been proposed for Tavis-Cummings systems [8, 9], which are of particular relevance for defect-related quantum emitters in semiconductors where strong cavity quantum electrodynamical (QED) coupling is currently achieved only with emitter ensembles [10\u201312]. Photon blockade is typically manifested in terms of the statistics of photons emitted from the cavity, where the two-photon correlation function g(2)(\u03c4) < 1 is used as an indicator of blockade. The correlation function can be measured with a Hanbury Brown-Twiss inter- ferometer using a pair of photon detectors, which is especially straightforward in the optical domain where detectors are readily available and highly efficient [13]. In the microwave domain where photon detectors are less developed, correlation functions can be determined from quadrature measurements of the field leaking out of the cavity using homodyne or heterodyne detection [5, 7, 14]. These measurements require high quality \u2217These authors contributed equally. \u2020 Corresponding author: mradulaski@ucdavis.edu quantum-limited amplifiers to achieve high SNR and can be very slow if high order moments of the field distri- bution need to be measured. Recent work has used the more direct approach of coupling an auxiliary qubit to the cavity to perform Wigner tomography of the cavity state to verify photon blockade [15, 16]. If the qubit and cavity are coupled in the strong dispersive limit the cav- ity photon number information can be mapped onto the qubit frequency. In this work we use N = 1, 2, 3 superconducting trans- mon qubits capacitively coupled to a co-planar waveg- uide (CPW) cavity [17] to achieve the photon blockade condition, observed in the cavity photon number. An ad- ditional transmon qubit in the strong-dispersive regime is used as a probe of the distribution of photon number states in the cavity. We employ photon number resolv- ing (PNR) spectroscopy [18, 19] of this ancillary qubit to detect which photon number states of the cavity are occupied in the presence and absence of photon blockade. We show that as the blockading qubits are tuned into res- onance with the cavity, the cavity occupation transitions from approximately Poissonian with up to n = 4 photons to sub-Poissonian occupation limited to only n = 0, 1. Our theoretical predictions explain the experimental data closely. These measurements constitute a simpler and more natural method for detection of photon blockade in superconducting cavity QED systems in the microwave regime. II.
