  "abstract": "In stark contrast to previous demonstrations where lasers were locked to the cavities, our setup locks the cavity to a laser. Our measurements of cavity length fluctuation suggest that the setup could stabi- lize a cavity up to a finesse of 1.2\u00d7104 without the diamond and 5.8\u00d7103 with the diamond crystal. The finesse with a diamond crystal of approximately 90 is primarily limited by the absorption loss inside the diamond. I. INTRODUCTION Optical cavities have diverse applications across various fields. They are critical in enhancing the stability and pre- cision of lasers,1 which is vital in optical communications. In metrology, they are used for highly accurate measurements, essential in both scientific research2 and industrial applica- tions. In quantum technology, optical cavities facilitate the control and manipulation of quantum states in the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED).3,4 Addi- tionally, they will play an essential role in quantum net- work nodes that achieve quantum communication and/or dis- tributed quantum computing.5,6 Apart from traditional appli- cations, optical cavities operating at cryogenic temperatures, typically around 4 K, are also essential for a variety of quan- tum technologies such as a single photon source,7,8 ion trap,9 optomechanics,10,11 microwave-millimeter wave converter12 or a gravitational wave detector.13 Traditionally, the optical cavities in such high-demand applications have been realized on stabilized optical tables to ensure the necessary mechanical stability and isolation from environmental vibrations at room temperature. Be- sides, the last two decades have witnessed significant ad- vancements in microwave quantum devices operating at mil- likelvin temperatures in dilution refrigerators, paving the way for microwave-optical hybrid applications, such as quantum transducers.14\u201323 These devices bidirectionally convert opti- cal and microwave photons, which is crucial for reliable quan- tum networks.6,24\u201326 Locking an optical cavity resonance fre- quency to the laser frequency is vital for photon indistin- guishability in these applications. However, stabilizing an optical cavity length within the commonly used \u2018cryogen- free\u2019 dilution refrigerators poses significant challenges due to considerable mechanical vibrations from the pulse-tube cryocoolers.27\u201329 One way to mitigate the cryocooler\u2019s vibrations is to inte- grate optical cavities and peripheral components into a chip or device,30\u201334 to which optical signals transmit through opti- cal fibers from room temperature to the device at the mixing a)These two authors contributed equally chamber stage. In such setups, the fibers and devices vibrate in a common mode, which effectively mitigates the vibration issue. However, this approach comes at the cost of losing the fast tunability of the cavity resonance frequency, which, in turn, requires the dynamical laser frequency tuning, as it must be locked to the cavity under such circumstances. Moreover, it introduces the technical challenge of achieving precise in- situ alignment to match the modes between the fibers\u2019 output (or input) and the devices\u2019 input (or output), which is further complicated by thermal drifts. Apart from the challenges associated with integrating op- tical cavities in dilution refrigerators, impurity spins in di- amond crystals have emerged as a promising resource for various quantum technology applications, including quan- tum sensing,35,36 microwave quantum memory,37\u201339 and sta- ble photon sources.40\u201342 These spins are also potential can- didates for spin-based microwave-optical photon transducers, which must be placed inside a dilution refrigerator. Addition- ally, the spin ensemble need to be coupled to a stabilized op- tical cavity for effective operation.22,23,43\u201347 In this work, we mitigate the vibration issue by ensur- ing that the optical cavity, mounted at the coldest tempera- ture stage, and the incoming optical beams share common mechanical modes, achieved through an optical breadboard installed on top. Using this setup, we reproducibly locked an optical cavity to the laser at approximately 15mK. Our goal is to realize efficient microwave-optical photon quantum transduction22,23,34,43 using an ensemble of impurity spins in diamond crystals. As a first step, we incorporated a bulk di- amond crystal into the optical cavity and successfully locked it. Consequently, we achieved a root mean square (rms) cavity length fluctuation of approximately tens of pm during locking. This measured cavity length fluctuation indicates that the cav- ity can readily support an effective finesse of 1.2\u00d7104 (with- out diamond) and 5.8\u00d7103 (with a diamond crystal). This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we dis- cuss the vibrations of our custom dilution refrigerator setup. Absolute and relative vibrations are measured and presented in Subsections II A and II B, respectively. In Section III, we describe the optical cavity device and measurement setup in Subsection III A and present the results of cavity stabilization, arXiv:2501.18938v1 [quant-ph] 31 Jan 2025"
