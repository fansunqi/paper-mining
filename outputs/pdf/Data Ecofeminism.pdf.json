  "abstract": "The rapid development and deployment of increasingly larger algorithmic models capable of analysing vast amounts of data are contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and waste generation. Generative models often consume substantially more energy than traditional models, with major tech firms increasingly turning to nuclear power to sustain these systems\u2014an approach that could have profound environmental consequences. This paper introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological alternatives of eco- societal transformations within the AI research context. Rooted in data feminism and ecofeminist frameworks, which interrogate about the historical and social construction of epistemologies underlying the hegemonic development of science and technology that disrupt communities and nature, these principles emphasise the integration of social and environmental justice within a critical AI agenda. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecofeminist algorithmic and infrastructural projects that prioritise and respect life, the people, and the planet.

The incident resulted in the release of radioactive gases from Unit 2, one of the plant\u2019s reactors. In response, local authorities evacuated 150,000 residents, including pregnant women and children, and ordered the closure of schools. Motivated by these events, these women formed the group called Women and Life on Earth. They issued a statement in 1979 calling for a reimagined society founded on ecological principles to prevent the threat of another nuclear disaster. One year later, in March 1980, they organised the first conference on ecofeminism in the US. The event drew over 600 women who engaged in discussions on ecological feminism, peace, and alternative energy solutions. This conference is widely recognised as the moment when the term ecofeminism was first introduced in the US, creating a vital intersection between environmentalism and feminism [89]. Forty-eight years later, in 2024, Microsoft announced plans to reopen one of the reactors at the Three Mile Island nuclear power station, the site that originally sparked the ecofeminist movement in the US [7]. This intersection of events provides an opportunity to revisit ecofeminist debates in the context of the contemporary race for innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Generative AI (GenAI) and its rapidly growing industry require vast amounts of energy to support the immense computational power needed for model training. GenAI models are built on larger algorithmic architectures, such as neural networks and stable diffusion techniques, which process large datasets to identify patterns and regenerate outputs like images, text, or videos. This computational power is translated into increased energy consumption by the GenAI industry. In fact, the energy demands of GenAI contribute significantly to its industry\u2019s carbon emissions [54, 88]. These emissions are exacerbated when the power grid supporting the data centres where GenAI models are trained relies on fossil fuels, raising concerns about the tech industry\u2019s ability to meet its net-zero commitments. Microsoft, for example, has pledged to eliminate its reliance on diesel fuel by 2030.
