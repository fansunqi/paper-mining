  "abstract": "\u2014In this paper, a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to assist a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system where local computation tasks from two users are of\ufb02oaded to the MEC server, facilitated by uplink RSMA for processing. The ef\ufb01ciency of the MEC service is hence primarily in\ufb02uenced by the RSMA-aided task of\ufb02oading phase and the subsequent task computation phase, where reliable and low- latency communication is required. For this practical consid- eration, short-packet communication in the Finite Blocklength (FBL) regime is introduced. In this context, we propose a novel uplink RSMA-aided MEC framework and derive the overall Successful Computation Probability (SCP) with FBL consideration. To maximize the SCP of our proposed RSMA- aided MEC, we strategically optimize: (1) the task of\ufb02oading factor which determines the number of tasks to be of\ufb02oaded and processed by the MEC server; (2) the transmit power allocation between different RSMA streams; and (3) the task-splitting factor which decides how many tasks are allocated to splitting streams, while adhering to FBL constraints. To address the strong coupling between these variables in the SCP expression, we apply the Alternative Optimization method, which formulates tractable subproblems to optimize each variable iteratively. The resultant non-convex subproblems are then tackled by Successive Convex Approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that applying uplink RSMA in the MEC system with FBL constraints can not only improve the SCP performance but also provide lower latency in comparison to conventional transmission scheme such as Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).

INTRODUCTION It is envisioned that 6th Generation (6G) will enable ubiqui- tous connectivity for a massive number of devices and provide low-latency and high-reliability communications services, such as the tactile Internet, remote surgery, and autonomous driving [1], [2]. These computation-intensive and latency-sensitive applications challenge both the computational capabilities of User Equipments (UEs) and the processing ef\ufb01ciency of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). A signi\ufb01cant bottleneck for MCC lies in the long propagation distances between end J. Xu is with Imperial College London. B.

It is widely acknowledged that relying only on Cloud Computing is insuf\ufb01cient to achieve the millisecond-level latency targets required for computing and communication in 6G networks [3]. Additionally, the massive data exchange between end users and remote cloud servers risks overwhelming and congesting networks, poten- tially leading to network bottlenecks. In contrast to MCC, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) allows UEs to of\ufb02oad their workloads to edge servers for nearby processing, improving computing performance and lowering network latency [4], [5]. The concept of MEC was \ufb01rstly proposed by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) in 2014, and was de\ufb01ned as a new platform providing IT and cloud computing capabilities within the Radio Access Networks (RAN) in close distance to mobile subscribers [6]. The de\ufb01nition of MEC is based on of\ufb02oading computation-intensive tasks from UEs to an edge device named MEC server which provides computing services to multiple UEs. Of\ufb02oading data from a large number of UEs to MEC servers substantially exacerbates the issue of spectrum scarcity. Therefore, in order to achieve high spectral ef\ufb01ciency, energy ef\ufb01ciency and guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of MEC networks, wireless resources must be used effectively and appropriate multiple access techniques are needed. [7]\u2013[9] have investigated the resource allocation problem in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) aided-MEC systems, respectively, demonstrating the bene\ufb01t of of\ufb02oading. Compared to these Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) schemes, Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been recognized as an enabler to improve both the spectral and energy ef\ufb01ciency [10]\u2013[13]. NOMA has been widely investigated and applied in the MEC network to improve energy ef\ufb01ciency, reliability and/or latency [14]\u2013[20]. The authors combined NOMA and MEC in [14]\u2013 [16] to optimize the weighted sum-energy consumption with the constraints of computation latency. Of\ufb02oading delay min- imization problem of NOMA-MEC network has been investi- gated in [17], [18], where [17] derived closed-form expressions for the optimal task partition ratio and of\ufb02oading transmit power, [18] has proposed and compared two algorithms to solve the optimization problem and further established the"
