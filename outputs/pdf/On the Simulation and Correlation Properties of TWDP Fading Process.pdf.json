The simulator employs two zero-mean stochastic sinusoids to simulate specular components, while a sum of sinusoids is used to model the diffuse one. Using the developed simulator, the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the quadrature components, as well as the autocorrelation of the complex and squared envelope, are derived for the first time in literature for channels experiencing TWDP fading. The statistical properties of the proposed simulator are thoroughly validated through extensive simulations, which closely align with the theoretical results.

INTRODUCTION Mobile radio channel simulators are widely used as cost-effective alternatives to field trials, providing reproducible solutions for rapid performance evaluation by accurately replicating the statistical properties of the real-world communication channels [1]. Consequently, numerous simulators are relying on filtering or sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) approaches to model various channel conditions. Among these, the earliest SoS simulators were designed for frequency non-selective Rayleigh channels [1]\u2013[6]. They are commonly used to model non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation conditions, where no strong specular components exist between the transmitter and the receiver. As a result, such signals consist solely of a diffuse component composed of many low-power scattered waves. Consequentially, corresponding simulators are created by representing the received signal as a superposition of a finite number of sinusoids, mostly with random amplitudes, frequencies, and/or phases. Thereby, to capture the statistical properties of signals received under the described conditions, Clark introduced a mathematical model assuming that the receiver receives N \u2192\u221escattered waves with equal amplitudes, but with random angles of arrival (AoA) and random phases, mutually independent and uniformly distributed over [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) [7]. Clark\u2019s model has been validated through numerous measurements [8] and has become a reference model for modeling propagation in NLOS conditions. As such, it has been used as the foundation of many Rayleigh SoS simulators, which, based on different assumptions about the This work was founded by Ministry of Education, Science and Youth of Sarajevo Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina (grant number) A.

The simulators mentioned above are also employed to model low-power scattered waves within Rician simulators, which are designed to simulate channels where the received signal consists of one strong specular component (typically line-of-sight, LoS) alongside a diffuse component. As a result, many Rician SoS simulators have been proposed to date, each exhibiting more or less desired statistical properties and specific computational efficiencies [1], [5], [6]. However, to date, no attention has been given to the development of simulators that considers more than one specular component, such as the TWDP channel. In these channels, the received signal consists of two dominant specular components along with numerous low-power scattered waves, and as a result, its first- and second-order statistics differ significantly from those in Rayleigh or Rician channels. Consequently, this paper presents a SoS-based simulator for modeling propagation in TWDP channels. In this simulator, the specular components are modeled as zero-mean stochastic sinusoids with pre-determined angles of arrival and random initial phases, while the diffuse component is simulated using the NLOS model proposed in [1]. The simulator is used to derive the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the quadrature components, as well as the autocorrelation of the complex envelope and its square, for signals propagating in TWDP channels. The statistical properties of the proposed simulator are compared with those calculated for the reference model, demonstrating excellent agreement between them. II. THE REFERENCE TWDP CHANNEL MODEL TWDP model assumes that the normalized envelope of the received signal, consisted of two specular and diffuse components, can be expressed as [9]: z(t) = 1 \u221a \u2126 \u0010 V1ej\u03d51(t) + V2ej\u03d52(t) + n(t) \u0011 (1) where V1 and V2 are magnitudes of the specular components which remain constant over the local stationary interval, \u03d51(t) and \u03d52(t) are random phases of specular components, n(t) is the zero-mean Gaussian-distributed diffuse component with an average power equals to 2\u03c32, and \u2126= V 2 1 + V 2 2 + 2\u03c32 is the average power of the overall TWDP fading process. In order to simulate the above defined TWDP fading process, let\u2019s assume communication scenario in which the receiver moves with constant velocity vector \u20d7v (as illustrated This work has been submitted for possible publication.
