  "abstract": "Let (W, R) be a Coxeter system and let w \u2208W. We say that u is a pre\ufb01x of w if there is a reduced expression for u that can be extended to one for w. That is, w = uv for some v in W such that \u2113(w) = \u2113(u) + \u2113(v). We say that w has the ancestor property if the set of pre\ufb01xes of w contains a unique involution of maximal length. In this paper we show that all Coxeter elements of \ufb01nitely generated Coxeter groups have the ancestor property, and hence a canonical expression as a product of involutions. We conjecture that the property in fact holds for all non-identity elements of \ufb01nite Coxeter groups. (MSC2000: 20F55) 1 Introduction Involutions play an important role in the study of Coxeter groups. By de\ufb01nition, any Coxeter group W is generated by a distinguished set R of involutions, known as the simple re\ufb02ections. Involutions in Coxeter groups are well understood: conjugates of simple re\ufb02ections are called re\ufb02ections, and any involution can be expressed as a canonical product of re\ufb02ections (see [4] and [8]). The involution conjugacy classes can be determined from the Coxeter graph with a simple algorithm due to Richardson [7]. Every element of a Coxeter group W can be written as a product of involutions (just take any expression for it as a product of simple re\ufb02ections). But if we work with the full set of involutions, expressions with fewer terms may be possible. For example, if W is \ufb01nite, every element of W is a product of at most two involutions [3, Lemma 5 and Theorem 6]. These two extremes behave markedly di\ufb00erently with respect to the length function. Recall that in a Coxeter system (W, R), the length of an element w of W, written \u2113(w), is the minimal length of any expression for w as a product of simple re\ufb02ections (by convention, the identity element has length zero). Such minimal length expressions are called reduced expressions. Any reduced expression w = r1r2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rn (where ri \u2208R for each i) by de\ufb01nition has the property that the length of w is the sum of the lengths of the involutions in this product. Expressions for w as a product of two involutions do not typically have this additive length property. That is, it cannot be guaranteed that involutions u1 and u2 can be chosen such that w = u1u2 and \u2113(w) = \u2113(u1) + \u2113(u2). (The minimum attainable value of \u2113(u1) + \u2113(u2) \u2212\u2113(w) is called the excess of w. Among other things, it has been shown (see [5]) that every element of a \ufb01nite Coxeter group is conjugate to an element with excess zero.) There may be many expressions for w as a product of two or more involutions which do have the additive length property. A natural question is whether one can write each w as a product of involutions u1, . . ., uk such that \u2113(w) = \u2113(u1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u2113(uk), in some canonical way \u2013 that is, unique subject to a simple criterion. In this paper we present a conjecture that indeed this can be done, and prove it in the special case of Coxeter elements. Let W be a Coxeter group with R the set of simple re\ufb02ections, and let w \u2208W. We say that u is a pre\ufb01x of w if there are r1, . . . , rn \u2208R, and 0 \u2264k \u2264n such that r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rk is a reduced \u2217School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom, s.hart@bbk.ac.uk \u2020School of Mathematics, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom, peter.j.rowley@manchester.ac.uk 1"
