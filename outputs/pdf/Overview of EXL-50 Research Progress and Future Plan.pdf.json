  "abstract": "XuanLong-50 (EXL-50) is the first medium-size spherical torus (ST) in China, with the toroidal field at major radius at 50 cm around 0.5T. CS-free and non-inductive current drive via electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) was the main physics research issue for EXL-50. Discharges with plasma currents of 50 kA -180 kA were routinely obtained in EXL-50, with the current flattop sustained for up to or beyond 2 s. The current drive effectiveness on EXL-50 was as high as 1 A/W for low- density discharges using 28GHz ECRH alone for heating power less than 200 kW. The plasma current reached Ip > 80 kA for high-density (>5 \u00d7 1018 m\u22122) discharges with 150 kW 28GHz ECRH. Higher performance discharge (Ip of about 120 kA and core density of about 1\u00d7 1019 m\u22123) was achieved with 150 kW 50GHz ECRH. The plasma current in EXL-50 was mainly carried by the energetic electrons. Multi-fluid equilibrium model has been successfully applied to reconstruct the magnetic flux surface and the measured plasma parameters of the EXL-50\u2019s equilibrium. The physics mechanisms for the solenoid-free ECRH current drive and the energetic electrons has also been investigated. Preliminary experimental results show that 100 kW of lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) waves can drive 20 kA of plasma current. Several boron injection systems were installed and tested in EXL-50, including B2H6 gas puffing, boron powder injection, boron pellet injection. The research plan of EXL-50U, which is the upgrade machine of EXL-50, is also presented. 1. INTRODUCTION The tokamak has been the most investigated and furthest advanced configuration among the magnetic confinement fusion systems. More recently, the spherical torus (ST) concept of aspect ratios around 1.5 [1-2] has been experimentally (START [3] , NSTX [4 , MAST [5], and Globus-M2 [6-7], ST-40[8]) tested to realize a substantially higher plasma beta compared to the tokamak of aspect ratios around 3, and is an attractive candidate for realizing a relatively compact fusion reactor. However, whether the central core of ST can survive the high dose of 14 MeV neutrons for a long enough time is one of the biggest challenges for the application of ST in future commercial D-T fusion reactor. On the other hand, the central stack of ST is not a serious bottleneck for an aneutronic proton-boron (p-11B) fusion reactor. The high beta and compactness of ST make it a potentially attractive candidate for p-11B fusion reactor. In addition to the aneutronic environment, p-11B fusion has the advantage of abundant and cheap fuel. ENN Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd (ENN) has made the roadmap for p-11B fusion based on spherical torus [9]."
