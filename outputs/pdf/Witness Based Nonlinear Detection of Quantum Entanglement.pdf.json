  "abstract": "We show that when the nonlinear entanglement detection strategy fails to detect the entanglement of an entangled state with two copies, it may succeed with three or more copies. Based on our strategy, a witness combined with a suitable quanutm mechanical observable may detect the entanglement that can not be detected by the witness alone. Moreover, our strategy can also be applied to detect multipartite entanglement by using the witnesses for bipartite systems, as well as to entanglement concentrations.

The quantum en- tanglement [1] is the most extensively studied quantum correlation, promising advantages over the classical cor- relations in many quantum information tasks such as quantum communications [2\u20134], quantum computing [5\u2013 7], quantum simulation [8] and quantum cryptography [9\u201311]. For the study of quantum entanglement, a basic is- sue is to determine whether a state is entangled or not. However, this problem is typically N-P hard [12]. Prac- tical entanglement detection not only needs to ensure ef- \ufb01ciency, that is to say use far fewer local measurements than those needed for state tomography, but also has adequate detection power [13, 14]. The entanglement witnesses [15] play important roles in experimental de- tection of quantum entanglement for unknown quantum states [16, 17]. Entanglement witnesses are observables that are nonnegative for all separable states and negative for some entangled states, and have been widely studied in recent years [18\u201342]. The authors in [18] show that each entanglement witness detecting the entanglement of a given bipartite state provides an estimation of the concurrence of this state. In [19] the authors provide two methods of constructing entanglement witnesses which detect entanglement that cannot be detected by the pos- itive partial transpose (PPT) criterion and the realign- ment criterion. A series of new ultra\ufb01ne entanglement witnesses have been proposed [27, 28], which can detect entangled states that the original entanglement witnesses cannot. The authors in [31] obtain an upper bound on the entanglement witness function in the measurement- device-independent entanglement witness scenario. Gen- eral and robust device-independent witnesses have been explored in [32], which can be applied to identify entan- glement in various arbitrary \ufb01nite dimensional multipar- tite quantum systems, based merely on bipartite Bell in- equalities. The author in [38] presents a method to obtain the lower bounds of the concurrence, entanglement of for- mation and geometrical entanglement measure based on entanglement witnesses. In [41], the authors extend the entanglement-certi\ufb01cation toolbox from correlations in mutually unbiased bases to arbitrary bases, even without requiring aligned reference frames. Sun et al. [42] present an approach to estimate the operational distinguishabil- ity between an entangled state and any separable state directly from the measurement of an entanglement wit- ness. Nonlinear entanglement detection is currently the re- search focus [43\u201347], which can outperform linear coun- terparts [48\u201351]. Liu et al. prove that if multi-copy joint measurements are allowed, the e\ufb00ectiveness of entangle- ment detection can be exponentially improved [44]. The authors in [45] characterize the genuine multipartite en- tanglement in the paradigm of multiple copies and con- jecture a strict hierarchy of activatable states. Rico et al. introduce a systematic method for nonlinear entan- glement detection based on trace polynomial inequali- ties [47]. In [50], the authors provide a method to con- struct nonlinear entanglement witnesses, which improve on linear entanglement witnesses in the sense that each non-linear entanglement witness detects more entangled states than its linear counterpart. Moreover, a nonlin- ear improvement of any entanglement witness for 2 \u00d7 d quantum systems was introduced by [51]. In fact, any entangled state can be detected by some proper entanglement witnesses, however, the construc- tion of witnesses is not a straightforward work and relies on the speci\ufb01c structure of the state to be detected. Our motivation here is not to search for or construct new en- tangled witnesses, but to better utilize the existing entan- gled witnesses to improve their ability of entanglement detection. That is to say, given a set of entanglement witnesses, the question is if they can be still employed"
