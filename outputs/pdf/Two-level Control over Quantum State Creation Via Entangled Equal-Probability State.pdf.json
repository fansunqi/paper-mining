  "abstract": "We propose the scheme realizing the two-level control over the unitary operators Uk creating the required quantum state of the system S. These operators are controlled by the superposition state of the auxiliary subsystem R which is governed by two control centers. The \ufb01rst-level control center (main control) creates the equal-probability pure state of R with certain distribution of phase factors that, in turn, govern the power of the second-level control center C that applies the special V -operators to the same subsystem R changing its state and thus controlling the applicability of Uk. In addition, the above phases are responsible for the entanglement in the subsystem R. We \ufb01nd the direct relation between this entanglement and the number of operators Uk that can be controlled by C. The simple example of a two-level control system governing the creation of entangled state of the two-qubit system S is presented. 1"
