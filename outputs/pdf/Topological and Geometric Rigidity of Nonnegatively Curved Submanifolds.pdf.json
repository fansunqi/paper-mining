  "abstract": "We investigate the topology and geometry of compact subman- ifolds in space forms of nonnegative curvature that satisfy a lower bound on the sectional curvature, depending only on the length of the mean curvature vector of the immersion. We show that this condition imposes strong constraints on either the topology or geometry of the submanifold. Additionally, we provide examples that demonstrate the sharpness of our result. 1 Introduction This paper focuses on the topological and geometric rigidity of compact submanifolds in space forms under a sectional curvature pinching condi- tion. Previous works have studied compact submanifolds in space forms with lower bounds on their sectional curvature, establishing rigidity results under conditions such as minimality or parallel mean curvature (see, for example, [7, 9, 24]). In the absence of such geometric constraints, topological rigidity is the only result that can generally be anticipated under sectional curvature pinch- ing conditions. Notably, signi\ufb01cant results have been achieved by various re- searchers when strict lower bounds are placed on sectional curvature relative to the mean curvature.
