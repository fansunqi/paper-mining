  "abstract": "Its sign and strength often determine crucial properties of magnetic objects, like their topology or how they can be manipulated with currents. A few experimental techniques are currently available to measure DMI quantitatively, based on the study of domain walls, spin waves, or spin-orbit torques. In this work, we propose a qualitative variant of spin wave methods. We rely on magnetic noise from confined thermal spin waves in domain walls and skyrmions in perpendicularly magnetized thin films, which we probe with scanning NV center relaxometry. We show both numerically and experimentally that the sign of the DMI can be inferred from the amplitude of the detected noise, which is affected by the non-reciprocity in the spin wave dispersion. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the noise distribution around the contour of magnetic skyrmions reveals their N\u00b4eel/Bloch nature, giving therefore also insight into the strength of DMI involved in their stabilization. Magnetic noise provides valuable information about systems in which incoherent or thermal magnetic excita- tions, as well as fluctuating spins, play a crucial role [1]. For example, noise spectroscopy can provide access to electron and hole spin dynamics in semiconductors [2, 3], properties of nanoparticles [4\u20137], information on mag- netic materials close to a phase transition [8], the detec- tion of thermal spin waves [9, 10], and spin transport phenomena [11]. Quantum sensors like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are especially useful to investi- gate these noise-related phenomena owing to their high sensitivity to their environment, whose fluctuations mod- ify their spin relaxation properties [12]. Integrating an NV sensor into an atomic force microscope combines high sensitivity noise sensing with nanoscale spatial resolu- tion [13]. This approach, referred to as scanning relax- ometry, allows the realization of electrical conductivity maps [14] or the investigation of magnetic textures, in particular, in low-moment materials like antiferromag- nets [15]. In this paper, we demonstrate how scanning relaxom- etry using NV centers can be harnessed to characterize the handedness of chiral spin textures, which in thin fer- romagnetic films are governed by the sign and strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) [16, 17]. It is known that thermal spin waves within textures like domain walls lie within the GHz range, which affects the longitudinal spin relaxation time T1 of the NV center [18]. The core idea of this work is that the nonreciprocal prop- agation of these spin waves, resulting from the DMI, also gives rise to different noise profiles above and below the film, from which information about the handedness of the spin textures can be deduced. We first illustrate the concept by considering an ul- trathin ferromagnetic film in contact with a heavy-metal underlayer, which induces an interfacial DMI [19, 20]. This form of the interaction favors spin spirals propagat- ing in the film plane [21], which translates into an asym- metric dispersion relation for spin waves in the Damon- Eshbach geometry for in-plane magnetized films [22\u201324], but does not affect perpendicularly-magnetized systems in which propagation remains isotropic. This effect has been probed in Brillouin light scattering experiments in which the asymmetry in the spin wave dispersion rela- tion [25] can be measured to quantify the interfacial DMI. For a perpendicularly-magnetized film in a multi-domain state [Fig. 1(a)], both reciprocal and nonreciprocal prop- agation are possible depending on where the propagation takes place. Within the domains, along the line indicated by xd in Fig 1(a), the dispersion is reciprocal as shown in Fig. 1(b). Along a 180\u25e6N\u00b4eel domain wall at the po- sition xw, on the other hand, the dispersion relation is strongly nonreciprocal with a narrow frequency gap as shown in Fig. 1(c), where both the DMI and dipolar in- teractions contribute to the asymmetry [26, 27]. The de- gree of asymmetry increases with D, as shown in Fig. S2 of the Supplemental Material [28]. Our objective is then to probe the magnetic noise produced by thermal spin waves inside such a domain wall using a single NV center placed above the mag- netic film. Previous studies on synthetic antiferromag- nets [18] have shown how the resulting fluctuating mag- netic fields shorten the longitudinal spin relaxation time T1, leading to a reduction of the photoluminescence (PL) signal emitted by the NV center [29]. This sens- ing method effectively filters the probed noise twice: it is frequency-filtered as only the frequency components around the magnetic resonance frequencies of the NV arXiv:2502.03166v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 5 Feb 2025"
