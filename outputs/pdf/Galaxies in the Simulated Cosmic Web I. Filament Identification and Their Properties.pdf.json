  "abstract": "As the environment harbouring the majority of galaxies, filaments are thought to play a key role in the co-evolution of galaxies and the cosmic web. In this first part of a series to understand the link between galaxies and filaments through cosmological simulations, we address two major current obstacles on this path: the difficulty of meaningful filament identification, and their poorly constrained properties and internal structure. We use the public EAGLE and TNG100 simulations to build physically motivated filament catalogues with the DisPerSE algorithm, based on the dark matter (DM) field at redshift z = 0 and z = 2, explicitly accounting for the multi- scale nature of filaments and with careful validation of results. Filament widths, lengths, and densities vary by factors \u22485\u2013100 in both simulations, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of filaments as a cosmic environment. All filaments are relatively thin, with overdensity profiles of galaxies, DM, and gas dropping to the cosmic mean within < 3 Mpc from their spines. Contrary to groups and clusters, filament cores are highly substructure dominated, by as much as \u224880 per cent. Filament gas maps reveal rich temperature and density structures that limit the applicability of simple cylindrically symmetric models. EAGLE and TNG100 agree that z = 2 filament spines are traced by overdense cool gas in pressure equilibrium with a >10\u00d7 hotter envelope. However, significant differences in detail between their predicted gas property maps imply that individual simulations cannot yet describe the baryon structure of filaments with certainty. Finally, we compare our fiducial filament network to one constructed from galaxies. The two differ in many aspects, but the distance of a galaxy to its nearest galaxy-based filament still serves as a statistical proxy for its true environment. Key words. Large-scale structure of Universe \u2013 Galaxies: evolution 1. Introduction On scales of \u22731 Mpc, the matter distribution in the Universe traces a complex structure that is now commonly referred to as the \u201ccosmic web\u201d (Bond et al. 1996): under-dense voids fill the majority of cosmic volume; sheet-like walls surround their edges; one-dimensional filaments lie at the intersection of walls; and finally nodes\u2014massive collapsed haloes that represent the densest cosmic regions\u2014sit at the intersection of filaments. Our view of this large-scale structure emerged from the first system- atic galaxy redshift survey (CfA; Davis et al. 1982) combined with the theory of anisotropic gravitational collapse (Zel\u2019dovich 1970), evidence for the abundance of non-baryonic dark mat- ter (DM; see Peebles 2017 and references therein), and pioneer- ing numerical simulations of a cold dark matter universe (Davis et al. 1985). More recent surveys have mapped the cosmic web out to at least redshift z \u223c1 (e.g. Kitaura et al. 2009; Malavasi et al. 2017; Davies et al. 2018), while simulations have con- firmed that its structure holds in the concordance \u039b Cold Dark Matter (\u039bCDM) cosmology (e.g. Springel et al. 2005; Angulo et al. 2012), in the presence of baryons (e.g. Pakmor et al. 2023; Schaye et al. 2023), and also when considering alternative dark matter models (e.g. Schneider et al. 2012). The cosmic web is not just a valuable tool for cosmology (e.g. Bond et al. 1996; Amendola et al. 2018; Bonnaire et al. \u22c6E-mail: yannick.bahe@nottingham.ac.uk 2022; Wu et al. 2024), but is also of central importance for un- derstanding galaxy evolution. The earliest evidence for a link between the two was the overabundance of early-type and red galaxies in regions of higher galaxy density, now commonly re- ferred to as the morphology-density (e.g. Oemler 1974; Dressler 1980; Postman & Geller 1984; Bamford et al. 2009) and colour- density relations (e.g. Poggianti et al. 1999; Balogh et al. 2004; Peng et al. 2010). Closely related trends have since been found for more physical galaxy properties (see e.g. the reviews by Blanton & Moustakas 2009 and Alberts et al. 2022, and refer- ences therein). Together, they imply a significant co-evolution of galaxies and their surrounding large-scale structure. This bond is strongest in the densest environments\u2014nodes that correspond to massive haloes\u2014but it persists to the more modest overdensities (e.g. Peng et al. 2010; Alberts et al. 2022) that encompass the majority of mass and galaxies in the Universe and are character- istic of filaments (e.g. Hahn et al. 2007; Cautun et al. 2014). While the existence of cosmic filaments is evident from both galaxy surveys and the dark matter distribution predicted by cos- mological simulations, detecting them in an objective and quan- titative way is considerably more challenging than for haloes. One reason for this is that filaments are generally less dense than haloes, and so stand out less prominently from their surround- ings. Another is that filaments are not virialised and therefore lack the (approximate) spherical symmetry of haloes. As a re- sult, there is no analogue to the virial radius that could define a Article number, page 1 of 29 arXiv:2502.06484v1 [astro-ph.GA] 10 Feb 2025"
