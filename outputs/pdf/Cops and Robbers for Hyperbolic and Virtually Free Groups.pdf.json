Lee, Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pedroza and Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez-Quinche define two new group invariants, the strong cop number sCop and the weak cop number wCop, by examining winning strategies for certain combinatorial games played on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. We show that a finitely generated group G is Gromov-hyperbolic if and only if sCoppGq \u201c 1. We show that G is virtually free if and only if wCoppGq \u201c 1, answering a question by Cornect and Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pedroza. We show that sCoppZ2q \u201c 8, answering a question from the original paper. It is still unknown whether there exist finite cop numbers not equal to 1, but we show that this is not possible for CAT(0)-groups. We provide machinery to explicitly compute strong cop numbers and give exam- ples by applying it to certain lamplighter groups, the solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, and Thompson\u2019s group F. 1. Introduction Cops and Robbers is a class of combinatorial two-player games that are usu- ally played on graphs or more generally, on metric spaces. Lee, Mart\u00b4\u0131nez-Pedroza and Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez-Quinche [LMPRQ23] introduced a variant where the existence of a winning strategy for either player is invariant under quasi-isometries, making the game interesting from a geometric group theory perspective. The game depends on a parameter called the number of cops. The cop number of a graph is the smallest number of cops such that there exists a strategy for the cop player where they always win. The cop number of a finitely generated group is the cop number of one of its Cayley graphs. In this work, we characterize the cop numbers in terms of well-known geometric invariants and resolve some open questions in the literature. There are two versions of the game: the strong cop game and the weak cop game, yielding two notions of cop numbers, which are known to be different in general. Hyperbolic groups are known to have strong cop number 1 [LMPRQ23, Theorem A]. We show that the converse also holds. Thus the strong cop number provides a new characterization of hyperbolic groups. Theorem A (Theorem 3.4). A finitely generated group G is Gromov-hyperbolic if and only if its strong cop number is 1. We provide a similar characterization for the weak cop number. As the strong cop number is at most equal to the weak cop number, we know that the weak cop number can only be 1 for hyperbolic groups. However, [LMPRQ23, Corollary J] states that one-ended hyperbolic groups have infinite weak cop number. We prove the following theorem that was first conjectured in [CMP24, Question 1.4].
