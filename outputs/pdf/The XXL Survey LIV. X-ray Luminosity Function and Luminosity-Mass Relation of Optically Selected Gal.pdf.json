  "abstract": "The overlap between the GAMA spectroscopic survey and the XXL X-ray survey was used to study the X-ray properties of optically-selected groups of galaxies. Forced X-ray aperture photometry was applied to an optically-selected sample of 235 groups (containing at least five member galaxies) to measure their X-ray luminosities in the regime of low signal to noise X-ray data. The sample encompasses X-ray luminosities over an order of magnitude fainter than typical X-ray selected samples, and avoids X-ray selection biases. This gives access to low mass groups where the effects of non-gravitational processes, such as AGN-feedback, should be most apparent and could inhibit their detection in an X-ray survey. We measured the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the sample, and found it to be consistent with the extrapolation of the XLF from X-ray selected samples at higher luminosities. The XLF was combined with a theoretical halo mass function to infer the form of the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and mass (LM relation) for the GAMA groups. We found a slope of 1.87 \u00b1 0.12, which is steeper than self similarity in this mass regime. When comparing with other measurements of the LM relation, we find evidence for a steepening of the slope in the low mass regime, likely due to the impact of non-gravitational processes. Our approach can be translated to eROSITA data using multi-wavelength surveys to constrain the X-ray properties of galaxy groups in the limits of high redshift and low mass.

Galaxy clusters comprise tens to thousands of galaxies plus an X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM) bound by a dark-matter-dominated gravitational potential well. While the investigation of high-mass galaxy clusters has a rich history, the lower-mass galaxy groups are intrinsically fainter and hence harder to find and study.
