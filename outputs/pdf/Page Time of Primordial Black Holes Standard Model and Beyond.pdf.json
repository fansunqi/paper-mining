Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of 6.23 \u00d7 1014 g would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time for Kerr black holes. For initial angular momenta values exceeding a\u22c6> 0.5, approximately 70% of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass MBH \u22721010 g. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from \u2206Neff measurements. I. INTRODUCTION Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that black holes (BHs) possess a temperature and emit radiation, a phenomenon known as Hawking radiation [1, 2]. This discovery completed the thermodynamic de- scription of BHs, expanding upon Bekenstein\u2019s pioneer- ing work [3], which established that a black hole\u2019s entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon. The re- sulting Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, a thermodynamic quantity, suggests that black holes may be quantum ob- jects with a finite number of internal degrees of freedom. However, a fundamental issue arises with this descrip- tion. Consider a BH formed from the collapse of a sys- tem initially in a pure state. At early stages, the emitted Hawking radiation appears thermal and thus resembles a mixed state. Note that this does not pose a problem. In the standard picture of Hawking evaporation, radiation emerges from the splitting of particle-antiparticle pairs, where one particle escapes to infinity while the other falls into the black hole interior. Since these pairs are entan- gled, the accessible Hawking radiation is naturally in a mixed state. In other words, the radiation remains en- tangled with the black hole, ensuring that the combined system remains in a pure state. The issue arises when considering the evolution of en- tropy. In the semiclassical framework, the von Neumann entropy of the radiation continues to grow throughout the evaporation process, while the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy steadily decreases. At a specific time, known as the Page time, the two entropies become equal. If the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy quantifies the BH\u2019s de- grees of freedom from the perspective of an outside ob- server, as postulated by the central dogma [4], then be- yond the Page time, the radiation entropy surpasses the \u2217yuber.perez@uam.es black hole\u2019s available degrees of freedom. At this stage, the radiation can no longer remain fully entangled with the black hole, leading to an apparent transition from a pure state to a mixed one. This violates unitarity and gives rise to the information paradox [4\u20139]. To resolve this paradox, the entropy of radiation must begin to decrease after the Page time, following the widely known Page curve [10\u201312]. Recently, using the gravitational path integral, the Page curve has been derived by applying the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [13] within the framework of what is referred to as the \u201cisland program\u201d [14\u201318]. Although this approach raises several open questions [19\u201321], it has provided crucial perspec- tives on BH evolution beyond the Page time. Nonethe- less, various alternative resolutions to the information paradox have been proposed [7, 22\u201325], along with de- bates on the validity of the central dogma, highlighting both supporting and opposing perspectives [8, 26\u201331]. Additionally, some arguments challenge the very exis- tence of the paradox itself [8]. Most studies addressing the information paradox have focused on its theoretical aspects or proposed resolutions. This naturally raises the question of whether experimen- tal insights could be gained from direct observations of black holes evaporating beyond the Page time, as well as the potential implications of the paradox for phe- nomenology. To directly observe Hawking evaporation, we would need black holes with masses much smaller than those formed through stellar collapse. One possi- ble candidate are primordial black holes (PBHs), which may have formed in the Early Universe. The possible existence of PBHs and their influence on cosmic evolution have garnered significant inter- est, particularly following the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) and the confirmation of astrophysical black holes [32]. Depending on their initial mass, strong con- straints exist on the abundance of PBHs that could have existed or still persist in the Universe [33, 34].
