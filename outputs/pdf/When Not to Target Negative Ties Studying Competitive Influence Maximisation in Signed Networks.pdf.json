  "abstract": "We explore the in\ufb02uence maximisation problem in networks with negative ties. Where prior work has focused on unsigned networks, we investigate the need to consider negative ties in net- works while trying to maximise spread in a population \u2014particularly under competitive conditions. Given a signed network we optimise the strategies of a focal controller against competing in\ufb02uence in the network using two approaches \u2014either the focal controller uses a sign-agnostic approach or they factor in the sign of the edges while optimising their strategies. We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of population) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate negative ties in these settings. More speci\ufb01cally, we study the impact of: (a) network topology, (b) resource conditions and (c) competitor strategies on the difference in vote shares ob- tained across both methodologies. We observe that gains are maximum when resources available to the focal controller are low and the competitor avoids negative edges in their strategy. Conversely, gains are insigni\ufb01cant irrespective of resource conditions when the competitor targets the network indiscriminately. Finally, we study the problem in a game-theoretic setting, where we simultane- ously optimise the strategies of both competitors. Interestingly we observe that, strategising with the knowledge of negative ties can occasionally also lead to loss in vote-shares. 1 Introduction Opinions are predominantly in\ufb02uenced by individual beliefs, social interactions and information made available through external interventions [Myers et al., , Watts and Dodds, 2007]. Of these, guid- ing collective opinions through external in\ufb02uence poses an interesting research problem which has far-reaching societal and commercial implications, such as trying to improve public health through controlled information campaigns [Wilder et al., 2018], campaigning in elections [Ranganath et al., 2016] and marketing for product adoption [Watts et al., 2007] in populations. The increasing reliance on social media and their pervasiveness in society today [Perrin, 2015] has thus inspired a rich body of work dedicated to understanding how opinions evolve in social networks and how they can be optimally steered through external in\ufb02uence [Banerjee et al., 2020, Noorazar, 2020]. In particular, a number of papers explore this problem in social [Kiss et al., 2017, Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015], po- litical [Galam, 1999] and economic settings [Easley and Kleinberg, 2010, Jackson, 2010]. However, a majority of this literature strictly investigates friendship networks where in\ufb02uence propagates based on positive recommendations and endorsements [Newman, 2003]. Effects of negative relation- ships on opinion propagation have received limited attention and have been historically discounted from network dynamics, given their sparse presence [Offer, 2021] and association with avoidance *corresponding author: schakraborty@turing.ac.uk 1"
