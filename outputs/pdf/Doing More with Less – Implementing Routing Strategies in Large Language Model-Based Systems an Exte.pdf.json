  "title": "Doing More with Less \u2013 Implementing Routing Strategies in Large Language Model-Based Systems an Exte.pdf",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component (e.g., conversational agents), are typic- ally monolithic static architectures that rely on a single LLM for all user queries. However, they often require different preprocessing strategies, levels of reasoning, or knowledge. Generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) trained on very large multi-topic corpora can perform well in a variety of tasks. They require significant financial, energy, and hardware resources that may not be justified for basic tasks. This implies potentially investing in unnecessary costs for a given query. To overcome this problem, a rout- ing mechanism routes user queries to the most suitable components, such as smaller LLMs or experts in specific topics. This approach may improve response quality while minimising costs. Routing can be expanded to other components of the con- versational agent architecture, such as the selection of optimal embedding strategies. This paper explores key considerations for integrating routing into LLM-based sys- tems, focusing on resource management, cost definition, and strategy selection. Our main contributions include a formalisation of the problem, a novel taxonomy of ex- isting approaches emphasising relevance and resource efficiency, and a comparative analysis of these strategies in relation to industry practices. Finally, we identify critical challenges and directions for future research. Keywords: Routing, Large Language Model, Optimisation, Cost, Survey 1. Background In the domain of computer network, a router can be defined as \u201ca device that sends data to the appropriate parts of a computer network\u201d.
