  "abstract": "GLEAM-X J1627\u201352 was discovered as a periodic (\u223c18 min) radio signal over a duration of three months in 2018. It is an enigmatic example of a growing population of \u2018long-period radio transients\u2019 consistent with Galactic origins. Their nature is uncertain, and leading models invoke magnetic neutron stars or white dwarfs, potentially in close binary systems, to power them. GLEAM-X J1627\u201352 resides in the Galactic plane with a comparatively coarse localisation (\u22432 arcsecond). Here we study the localisation region to search for spectrophotometric signatures of a counterpart using time-domain searches in optical and near-infra-red imaging, and MUSE integral field spectroscopy. No sources in the localisation display clear white dwarf spectral signatures, although at the expected distance we can only provide modest limits on their presence directly. We rule out the presence of hot sub-dwarfs in the vicinity. We found no candidate within our search for variability or periodic behaviour in the light curves. Radial velocity curves additionally show only weak evidence of variation, requiring any realistic underlying system to have very low orbital inclination (\ud835\udc56\u22725 deg). Two Balmer emission line sources are reminiscent of white dwarf pulsar systems, but their characteristics fall within expected M-dwarf chromospheric activity with no signs of being in a close binary. Currently the white dwarf pulsar scenario is not supported, although longer baseline data and data contemporaneous with a radio active epoch are required before stronger statements. Isolated magnetars, or compact binaries remain viable. Our limits highlight the difficulty of these searches in dense environments at the limits of ground-based data.

Well- established Galactic populations of pulsars (Manchester et al. 2005) and magnetars (Olausen & Kaspi 2014) have been known for many years and are seen to display periodicity of emission on timescales of \u227210 seconds. Conversely, a small subset of the more-recently discov- ered extra-galactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) show repeating bursts on timescales of \u223c0.4 \u221240 days (Chime/Frb Collaboration et al. 2023, although notable exceptions have displayed bursts at higher rates for periods of time, e.g. Lanman et al. 2022). Rotating (and magnetised) neutron stars naturally explain these Galactic populations (e.g. Lyne et al. 1985; Thompson & Duncan 1995) and are also a leading model for repeating FRBs (Cordes & Chatterjee 2019). Between these two \u2605E-mail: J.D.Lyman@warwick.ac.uk (JDL) time-scales, an emerging population of long-period Galactic radio transients is been revealed (e.g. Hyman et al. 2005; Hurley-Walker et al. 2023; Caleb et al. 2022; Hurley-Walker et al. 2024; de Ruiter et al. 2024; Dong et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Lee et al. 2025) that is challenging current models. The population is grouped on display- ing periodic coherent radio emission on minutes to hour timescales, however they are otherwise relatively heterogeneous. Some sources display regular period emission over long timescales (years), with others seemingly active only for short periods and/or showing only intermittent burst emission. The pulse profiles of the emission are also characteristically diverse, even for a given source. Rotating Radio Transients (McLaughlin et al. 2006) share some of these characteris- tics, albeit without clear periodicity in the burst emission, a defining characteristic of these long-period radio transients. Among the emerging population of long-period Galactic radio transients is GLEAM-X J162759.5\u2013523504.3 (hereafter GLEAM- X J1627\u201352). Reported by Hurley-Walker et al. (2022), GLEAM- X J1627\u201352 is a Galactic Plane source at a distance of 1.3 \u00b1 \u00a9 2025 The Authors arXiv:2502.14688v1 [astro-ph.SR] 20 Feb 2025"
