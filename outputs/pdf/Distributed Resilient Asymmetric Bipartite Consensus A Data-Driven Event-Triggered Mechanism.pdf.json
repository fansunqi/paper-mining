  "abstract": "\u2014The problem of asymmetric bipartite consensus control is investigated within the context of nonlinear, discrete- time, networked multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To address the challenges posed by these aperiodic DoS attacks, a data-driven event-triggered (DDET) mechanism has been developed. This mechanism is specifically designed to synchronize the states of the follower agents with the leader\u2019s state, even in the face of aperiodic communication disruptions and data losses. Given the constraints of unavailable agents\u2019 states and data packet loss during these attacks, the DDET control framework resiliently achieves leader- follower consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two numerical examples, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle the complexities arising from aperiodic DoS attacks in nonlinear MAS settings.

INTRODUCTION The topic of consensus in multi-agent systems (MAS) has garnered significant attention due to its focus on achieving a common agreement among a group of agents through neighborhood negotiations. It is well-recognized that the ad- vantageous outcomes of achieving consensus in MAS have found extensive applications in the field of control engineering. These applications include, but are not limited to, flocking, swarming, formation control, and synchronization [1]. In practical scenarios, the dynamics within MAS often display a mix of cooperative and competitive interactions, similar to the dual nature of trust and distrust in social networks or competition in economic markets. These dynamics significantly affect agent collaboration. Altafini introduced the concept of bipartite consensus for integrator MAS, using graph theory to model complex relationships among agents with both positive and negative interactions represented within a signed graph [2]. This model allows agents to either oppose each other with equal force or converge towards a neutral position, especially in the absence of structural balance. Real-world scenarios often require an asymmetrical ap- proach to bipartite consensus. For example, multilateral tele- operation systems adjust force feedback based on the differ- ing masses of equipment [3]. Similarly, rehabilitation robots for lower limbs provide customized assistance or resistance according to the muscle strength of each patient\u2019s leg [4]. These applications highlight the need for strategies tailored to the specific requirements of asymmetric consensus, which is a central theme of this research. Developing accurate mathematical models for nonlinear MAS is often a time-consuming and challenging task, further complicated by unmodeled dynamics and a lack of robustness. These issues can lead to overly complex control designs that are impractical, especially when added network complexities further complicate matters [5], [6]. As a solution, there is a growing trend in the field towards adopting data-driven control approaches that eliminate the need for detailed system modeling. Furthermore, MAS are increasingly exposed to cyberse- curity risks [7]\u2013[11], particularly through cyber-attacks such as aperiodic DoS attacks, due to their reliance on com- munication networks. These attacks disrupt communication, causing data loss, miscoordination, and severe impacts on system performance, potentially leading to complete failure [12]. The decentralized and interconnected nature of MAS complicates the application of traditional cybersecurity mea- sures, necessitating tailored security solutions for each agent in dynamically changing networks. Aperiodic DoS attacks, by interrupting data flow, pose significant threats to the integrity arXiv:2502.04497v1 [eess.SY] 6 Feb 2025"
