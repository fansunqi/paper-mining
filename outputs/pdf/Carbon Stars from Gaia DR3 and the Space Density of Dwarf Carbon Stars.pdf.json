  "title": "Carbon Stars from Gaia DR3 and the Space Density of Dwarf Carbon Stars.pdf",
  "abstract": "Carbon stars (with atmospheric C/O> 1) range widely in temperature and luminosity, from low mass dwarfs to asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). The main sequence dwarf carbon (dC) stars have inherited carbon-rich material from an AGB companion, which has since transitioned to a white dwarf. The dC stars are far more common than C giants, but no reliable estimates of dC space density have been published to date. We present results from an all-sky survey for carbon stars using the low-resolution XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We developed and measured a set of spectral indices contrasting C2 and CN molecular band strengths in carbon stars against common absorption features found in normal (C/O< 1) stars such as CaI, TiO and Balmer lines. We combined these indices with the XP spectral coefficients as input to supervised machine-learning algorithms trained on a vetted sample of known C stars from LAMOST. We describe the selection of the carbon candidate sample, and provide a catalog of 43,574 candidates dominated by cool C giants in the Magellanic Clouds and at low galactic latitude in the Milky Way. We report the confirmation of candidate C stars using intermediate (R \u223c1800) resolution optical spectroscopy from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, and provide estimates of sample purity and completeness. From a carefully-vetted sample of over 600 dCs, we measure their local space density to be \u03c10 = 1.96+0.14 \u22120.12 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc\u22123 (about one dC in every local disk volume of radius 50 pc), with a relatively large disk scale height of Hz = 856+49 \u221243 pc.

Introduction Strong atmospheric carbon (C>O) is only intrinsic to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that have un- dergone the third dredge-up (thermally pulsing, or TP- AGB) phase, whereby strong convection brings helium, carbon, and s-process elements to the surface (Iben 1974; Iben & Renzini 1983). However, a whole family of carbon and related stars exist. Carbon stars are tra- ditionally broken up into the following categories: C-H, C-R, and C-N. Other notable categories are C-J, Barium (Ba), CH, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars (Wallerstein & Knapp 1998). C-N, C-H, and C-R can be differentiated by their carbon band strength and colors. C-N stars are the reddest stars with the deepest carbon bands \u2013 typically AGB stars and other giants. Corresponding author: Benjamin R. Roulston broulsto@clarkson.edu Since AGB C stars are luminous, they are easily de- tectable to large distances in the halo of the Milky Way, as well as in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and other nearby galaxies. C-H and C-R are bluer stars, often subgiants and difficult to distinguish from each other. These stars\u2019 carbon bands are weaker in strength than C-N stars. Many C-R stars in the literature are ac- tually misclassified C-N or C-H stars, but the evolution of the genuine early C-R stars is still debated (Izzard et al. 2007; Zamora et al. 2009). Barium stars tend to have relatively weak carbon bands, similar in strength to some of the early C-R stars, however, these are also accompanied by Ba II absorption lines at 4007 \u02daA and 4554 \u02daA. A high binary fraction has been found for C-H, Ba and the s\u2212process rich CEMP\u2212s stars (McClure & Woodsworth 1990; Jorissen et al. 1998, 2016; Lucatello et al. 2005). The bulk of the literature on C stars concerns C gi- ants and C-AGB stars. Significant progress has been made in theoretical modeling of nucleosynthesis in C- arXiv:2501.18763v1 [astro-ph.SR] 30 Jan 2025"
