  "abstract": "We construct explicit examples that are algebraic varieties in pos- itive characteristic to show that locally trivial moduli functors do not always satisfy Schlessinger\u2019s condition (H1) in [3], in contrast to the complex/characteristic 0 case. The \ufb01rst example is an algebraic curve, and the second is a normal rational projective surface with only one rational double point.
