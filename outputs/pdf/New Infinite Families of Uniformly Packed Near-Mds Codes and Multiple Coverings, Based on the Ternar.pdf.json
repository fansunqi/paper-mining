  "title": "New Infinite Families of Uniformly Packed Near-Mds Codes and Multiple Coverings, Based on the Ternar.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We obtained \ufb01ve new in\ufb01nite families of linear near-MDS codes uniformly packed in the wide sense (UPWS); these codes are also almost perfect multiple coverings of the deep holes or farthest-o\ufb00points (APMCF), i.e. the vectors lying at distance R (covering radius) from the code. The families are constructed by m-lifting when one takes a starting code C over the ground Galois \ufb01eld Fq with a parity check matrix H(C) and then considers the codes Cm over Fqm, m \u22652, with the same parity check matrix H(C). As starting codes we used the ternary perfect Golay code and codes obtained by its extension and puncturing. To prove the needed combinatorial properties (UPWS and APMCF) we used the m-lifting of the dual codes and features of near-MDS codes. A general theorem on in\ufb01nite families of UPWS near-MDS codes is proved.
