  "abstract": ". We give an algebraic (non-analytic) proof of the deformed boson-fermion Fock space construction of Molev\u2019s double supersymmetric Schur functions, among other results, from our previous paper. In other words, we make no assumptions on the variables and parameters. By specializing to a \ufb01nite number of variables and shifting parameters, we recover the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, we realize the bosonic construction through a representation of a completion of the in\ufb01nite rank general linear Lie algebra. 1. Introduction This is a companion to our other paper [3]; here, we give purely algebraic proofs when one set of parameters is zero. In more detail, we had to impose certain analytic conditions in [3] on the two sets of parameters \u03b1 = (\u03b1i)i\u2208Z and \u03b2 = (\u03b2i)i\u2208Z (along with the auxiliary indeterminates). Yet, if we take \u03b2 = 0 (that is, \u03b2i = 0 for all i \u2208Z), then we can prove our results without imposing any conditions on \u03b1 (or on the supersymmetric function variables x and y) by using Laurent series rings such as Z[\u03b1]((z)). This paper provides the necessary algebraic proofs to results that previously had analytic assumptions. In other words, we can work over the coe\ufb03cient rings Z[\u03b1] instead of C (with \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2286C). All of the other results from [3] will follow without modi\ufb01cation; in particular, we have the following results (taking \u03b2 = 0). Theorem 1.1. Let \u03bb be a partition. There exists an \u03b1 deformation of the classical boson- fermion correspondence such that the image of the basis vector |\u03bb\u27e9of fermionic Fock space is Molev\u2019s double supersymmetric Schur function [15, 16] of shape \u03bb with the parameters reindexed by \u03b1i 7\u2192\u03b11\u2212i. Moreover, the image of |\u03bb\u27e9under a natural dual version equals Molev\u2019s dual Schur functions. Theorem 1.2. The deformed half vertex operators correspond to row transfer matrices of known natural solvable \ufb01ve vertex lattice models with row and column parameters. We refer to [3, Thm. 5.1, Thm. 6.10, Cor. 6.11] (with taking \u03b2 = 0) for precise statements and an introduction to this topic, including historical references. Other than the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 (which would be copied verbatim), this paper is written to be self-contained and have numerous examples. One key advantage of taking \u03b2 = 0, beyond allowing formal/algebraic proofs, is that we perform computations that range over \ufb01nite sums. Therefore, the complexity of working with the constructions and corresponding symmetric functions is reduced. Additionally, it allows us to give a representation theoretic interpretation (without any analytic conditions) of our deformed boson-fermion construction. Indeed, in Section 3, we work in a completion of gl\u221e that we call near (upper) triangular matrices, which has an associative algebra structure. The Lie algebra of this completion has appeared implicitly though the corresponding Lie 1"
