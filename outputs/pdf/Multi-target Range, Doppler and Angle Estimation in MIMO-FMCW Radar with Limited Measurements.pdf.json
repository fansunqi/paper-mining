  "abstract": "\u2014Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar offers several performance and flexibility advantages over traditional radar arrays. However, high angular and Doppler resolutions necessitate a large number of antenna elements and the transmission of numerous chirps, leading to increased hardware and computational complexity. While compressive sensing (CS) has recently been applied to pulsed-waveform radars with sparse measurements, its application to frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for target detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CS-based multi-target localization algorithm in the range, Doppler, and angular domains for MIMO-FMCW radar, where we jointly estimate targets\u2019 velocities and angles of arrival. To this end, we present a signal model for sparse- random and uniform linear arrays based on three-dimensional spectral estimation. For range estimation, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based focusing and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based techniques, each with distinct advantages, while two-dimensional CS is used for joint Doppler-angle estimation. Leveraging the properties of structured random matrices, we establish theoretical uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees with high probability for the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve similar detection performance and higher resolution compared to conventional DFT and MUSIC with fewer transmitted chirps and antenna elements.

INTRODUCTION Sensing the environment using radar or other sensors is an integral part of many engineering applications. A radar usually localizes a target of interest by estimating its range, Doppler velocity, and angle of arrival (AoAs). Owing to their portability, low cost, and high range resolution, frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are often preferred in short-range applications like advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) [2, 3], synthetic aperture radars (SARs) [4, 5], surveillance systems [6, 7], and human vital sign monitoring [8]. FMCW radars transmit a finite number of linear frequency-modulated (LFM) chirps in each coherent processing in- terval (CPI). The receiver mixes the signal reflected from targets with the transmitted signal, producing a complex sinusoidal intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The IF signal\u2019s frequencies then determine the target ranges and velocities. To further localize targets in the angular domain, an array of multiple transmitter and receiver antennas is required. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars transmit multiple orthogonal waveforms and jointly process the target returns across multiple receivers, providing additional degrees of freedom and higher resolution compared to conventional phased array radars, but with fewer physical antenna elements. Traditionally, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been used to estimate the frequencies present in the IF signal [2, 9]. However, in this approach, the range and velocity resolutions depend on the bandwidth and CPI. Achieving high range resolution necessitates large bandwidths, while high velocity resolution requires transmitting and processing a large number of chirps. Similarly, array processing theory dictates that achieving a high angular resolution demands \u2217Co-first authors.

The conference precursor of this work is [1]. a large array aperture with numerous antenna elements to avoid ambiguities [10]. Although MIMO technology enhances angular resolution, synthesizing a large virtual array with half-wavelength element spacing can be costly. Consequently, increasing resolution results in greater hardware and computational complexity. In order to mitigate these challenges, subspace-based parameter estimation techniques have been proposed in the literature. Multiple signal classification (MUSIC) has been introduced for range and angle estimation in [11, 12]. Estimation of signal parameters via rotational techniques (ESPRIT) is suggested in [13], while [14] explores a joint DFT-ESPRIT framework. Array interpolation and eigenstructure methods are investigated in [15]. Although subspace-based methods offer high resolutions, they have several drawbacks. These methods typically assume non-coherent sources or require additional smoothing in the coherent case. Ad- ditionally, they often necessitate prior knowledge of the number of targets to be estimated. The computational complexity of these methods escalate significantly when estimating parameters in multi- dimensional signals. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as an efficient technique for sparse signal recovery with limited measurements [16]. By utilizing a user-defined parameter grid, CS facilitates high-resolution estimation with a small number of mea- surements and low computational efforts. In this work, we utilize CS techniques in MIMO-FMCW radars for range and joint velocity-angle estimation at high resolutions but using a small number of antenna elements and transmitted chirps. Note that in radar, the sampled IF signal, chirps in each CPI, and array channels correspond to measurements across different domains, known as fast-time, slow- time, and spatial domain samples, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the theoretical recovery guarantees for our joint velocity- angle estimation framework and demonstrate the performance of our proposed method through extensive numerical experiments. A. Prior Art Earlier CS applications in radar systems typically focused on uniform sampling or full measurements. In [17], CS replaced the matched filter reducing the sampling rate for radar imaging, while [18, 19] explored high-resolution estimation in a general 2D time- frequency domain. Efficient waveforms to reconstruct sparse targets were suggested in [20]. In [21, 22], the randomized measurement framework was utilized for radar imaging in remote sensing and inverse SAR applications. A CS-based constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector was developed in [23] while [24] used CS to leverage the diversity of various array orientations for high-resolution spatial spectrum reconstruction. Recently, [25] proposed a two-level CS-based compression technique for fast target detection in MIMO radar compared to conventional methods. A key benefit of CS techniques is the reduction in measurement requirements for sparse signals. In radar, the target scene is sparse because only a few targets are typically present, making CS a natural fit for the problem. As a result, CS has been widely adopted to enable sub-Nyquist radars with reduced measurements [26\u201328]. In the spatial domain, sparse linear arrays (SLAs), with fewer antenna elements compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs), have been introduced for both pulsed and continuous-wave radars [9, 29, 30].
