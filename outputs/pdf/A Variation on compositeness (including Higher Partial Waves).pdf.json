  "abstract": "The \u201cspatial interpretation of compositeness\u201d, presented and discussed in [1, 2] in the context of non-relativistic potential scattering, is extended to higher partial waves. A particular set of basis states is used to arrive at a slightly different perspective on the derivation and interpretation of \u201ccompositeness\u201d usually given in the literature. 1 arXiv:2502.08413v1 [nucl-th] 12 Feb 2025"
