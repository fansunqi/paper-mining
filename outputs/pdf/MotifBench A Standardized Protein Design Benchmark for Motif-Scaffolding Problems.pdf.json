  "title": "MotifBench A Standardized Protein Design Benchmark for Motif-Scaffolding Problems.pdf",
  "abstract": "The motif-scaffolding problem is a central task in computational protein design: Given the co- ordinates of atoms in a geometry chosen to confer a desired biochemical function (a motif), the task is to identify diverse protein structures (scaffolds) that include the motif and maintain its geometry. Significant recent progress on motif-scaffolding has been made due to computational evaluation with reliable protein structure prediction and fixed-backbone sequence design methods [1\u201317]. However, significant variability in evaluation strategies across publications has hindered comparability of results, challenged reproducibility, and impeded robust progress. In response we introduce MotifBench, comprising (1) a precisely specified pipeline and evaluation metrics, (2) a col- lection of 30 benchmark problems, and (3) an implementation of this benchmark and leaderboard at github.com/blt2114/MotifBench. The MotifBench test cases are more difficult compared to earlier benchmarks (e.g. [4]), and include protein design problems for which solutions are known but on which, to the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art methods fail to identify any solution.
