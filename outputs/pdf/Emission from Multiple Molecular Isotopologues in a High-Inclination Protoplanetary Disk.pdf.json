  "abstract": "We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO2, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C18O16O and H13CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C17O16O and HC15N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO2 and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup\u2019s spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision. 1. INTRODUCTION The observational study of protoplanetary disk chemistry in the few AU region was set in motion by the discovery of a forest of molecular emission lines (Carr & Najita 2008; Salyk et al. 2008) using the Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph (Spitzer- IRS; Houck et al. 2004). That work detected and charac- terized the emitting properties of several simple molecules including water, HCN, C2H2, CO2 and OH (Carr & Na- jita 2011), and allowed for basic accounting of key atomic species O,C and N in the inner disk (Pontoppidan et al. 2010). However, cosmochemistry in a solar system context of- ten depends on a close attention to isotopic ratios. In the solar system, isotopic uniformity of many heavier refrac- tory elements suggest substantial mixing prior to the forma- tion of most planetary building blocks (e.g. Zhu et al. 2001; Moynier et al. 2009; Pringle et al. 2013). But small het- erogeneities, especially of the volatile \u201cCHON\u201d atoms, tell Corresponding author: Colette Salyk cosalyk@vassar.edu a more complex story. Each CHON atom may have a distinct isotopic history, including mixing between primordial reser- voirs influenced by stellar nucleosynthesis and more pro- cessed solar-system materials, plus combinations of mass- dependent and mass-independent fractionation during early solar system evolution. Isotope ratios are often distinct for certain classes of solar system objects, such that they can be used to trace back the origins of a given object\u2019s volatiles (e.g. Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2015; Lis et al. 2013). Hydrogen, as measured primarily in water, shows enhance- ment in D/H in comets as compared to the protosolar value and some planetary materials, reflecting possible inheritance of materials deuterated in the cold interstellar medium (ISM; Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2015). Earth also has a relatively high D/H ratio, suggesting a possible outer solar system con- tribution to its water reservoir (e.g. Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2015). Nitrogen, as measured in CN and HCN, shows a rough trend of increased enhancement in heavier 15N from the protosolar value, to inner solar system bodies, and then to outer solar system bodies, like comets (Marty 2012). Carbon shows a wide range of 13C/12C ratios as measured in presolar grains, likely reflecting pollution by extraterrestrial materials arXiv:2502.05061v1 [astro-ph.SR] 7 Feb 2025"
