Kazemi1 1Laser and Plasma Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran 19839-69411, Iran In this article, we study the effects of intrinsic nonlinear optomechanical interaction on the linear response of a driven-dissipative optomechanical system to a weak time-dependent perturbation. By calculating the linear response of the cavity optical mode to a weak probe laser in the framework of the generalized linear response theory, it is shown how the Stokes and anti-Stokes sideband amplitudes as well as the power reflection coeffi- cient, and the density of states of the cavity optical mode are expressed in terms of photonic retarded Green\u2019s functions. Then, we derive the equations of motion of retarded Green\u2019s functions of the system from nonlinear quantum Langevin equations and solve them. It is shown that for a single-photon optomechanical coupling of the order of the cavity linewidth, the nonlinear effect does not manifest itself unless the system satisfies a resonance condition, where the frequency of the upper normal mode of the system is twice that of the lower one. Based on the generality of the present approach which works at all regimes, the validity of linearization approximation is also confirmed at the off-resonance regime. I. INTRODUCTION Recent theoretical and experimental developments in quan- tum optomechanics [1, 2] have provided suitable conditions to observe the nonlinear nature of radiation pressure interac- tion between the optical and mechanical modes. Although the optomechanical interaction is nonlinear intrinsically, most achievements like ground-state cooling of the mechanical vi- brations [3], displacement and force sensing [4\u20139], and entan- glement generation [10] have been obtained in strongly driven regime where the dynamics is effectively linear. Nevertheless, there are interesting features like generation of nonclassical states and several others which occur in the nonlinear regime [11\u201313]. The effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction do not arise in driven-dissipative optomechanical systems (OMSs) unless the single-photon optomechanical coupling is of the order of the cavity linewidth. However, achieving such a large single-photon optomechanical coupling has been very challenging experimentally with few exceptions like super- conducting circuits [14], silicon-based optomechanical crys- tals [15], and hybrid optomechanical systems containing cold atoms or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [16\u201318]. In such hybrid OMSs the fluctuation of the collective excitation of the atomic field behaves like an effective mechanical mode which is coupled with the radiation pressure of cavity optical field [19\u201322]. Interestingly, many of the essential intrinsic properties and dynamical behaviors of such driven-dissipative quantum sys- tems can be straightforwardly determined by the study of their linear response to a weak time-dependent perturbation which can be formulated either in the Schr\u00a8odinger picture through the master equation approach [23\u201325] or in the Heisenberg picture through the quantum Langevin equations (QLEs) [26]. Furthermore, there are linear response approaches based on Green\u2019s function equations of motion [27, 28] which have \u2217a dalafi@sbu.ac.ir been mostly formulated for closed quantum systems in con- tact with a thermal reservoir at finite temperature. Neverthe- less, a similar approach based on Green\u2019s function equation of motion has been recently introduced in the framework of theory of open quantum system, named the generalized linear response theory (GLRT) [29]. Based on the GLRT, one can obtain a set of equations of motion for the open quantum system Green\u2019s functions which are derived in the Heisenberg picture through the QLEs. Fur- thermore, the GLRT clarifies the relations between the sys- tem susceptibilities and Green\u2019s functions. In this way, one can describe many interesting quantum optical phenomena like normal mode splitting [30\u201332], electromagnetically in- duced transparency (EIT) [33], slow light realization [34, 35], optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) [36\u201339], op- tomechanically induced gain (OMIG) [40, 41], and Fano res- onance [42\u201345] in terms of the open system Green\u2019s func- tions. These phenomena have been recently studied [46, 47] in bare and hybrid OMSs in the framework of GLRT in the linear regime, where the cavity photon number is large and the single-photon optomechanical coupling is small compared with the cavity linewidth and mechanical frequency. In the present work, we study the linear response of a bare OMS in the framework of GLRT beyond the linearization ap- proximation where the intrinsic nonlinear optomechanical in- teraction is no longer ignorable. For this purpose, we derive the equations of motion of the system Green\u2019s functions from nonlinear QLEs in the framework of the theory of open quan- tum systems. In spite of previous papers [29, 46, 47], where the system has been studied in the linearization approxima- tion, the great challenge of the present work in applying the GLRT for a nonlinear OMS is the manifestation of an infinite hierarchy in the Green\u2019s functions equations of motion. Using Wick\u2019s theorem [48] and considering the 3-fold correlations as new variables, we demonstrate that the hierarchy can be trun- cated by neglecting 4-fold correlations, resulting in a system of linear differential equations with a dimensionality higher than that of the nonlinear QLEs for the Green\u2019s functions. Our results show that in the nonlinear regime, where the single-photon optomechanical coupling is of the order of cav- arXiv:2502.10302v1 [quant-ph] 14 Feb 2025"
