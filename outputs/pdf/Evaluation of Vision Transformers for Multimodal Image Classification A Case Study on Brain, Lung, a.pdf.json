  "abstract": "Neural networks have become the standard technique for medical diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and classification. This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architec- tures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future works will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a pivotal advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.

The statistics show that it is the leading cause of death affecting society, resulting in millions of deaths each year. According to [1], there were an estimated 19.3 million new cases of cancer and 9.9 million cancer-related deaths in 2020. arXiv:2502.05517v1 [cs.CV] 8 Feb 2025"
