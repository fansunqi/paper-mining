  "title": "A Tate Algebra Version of the Jacobian Conjecture.pdf",
  "abstract": ". This paper investigates a Tate algebra version of the Jacobian conjecture, referred to as the Tate-Jacobian conjecture, for commutative rings R equipped with an I-adic topology. We show that if the I-adic topology on R is Hausdor\ufb00and R/I is a subring of a Q-algebra, then the Tate-Jacobian conjecture is equivalent to the Jacobian conjecture. Conversely, if R/I has positive characteristic, the Tate-Jacobian conjecture fails. Furthermore, we establish that the Jacobian conjecture for C is equivalent to the following statement: for all but \ufb01nitely many primes p, the inverse of a polynomial map over Cp whose Jacobian determinant is an element of C\u00d7 p lies in the Tate algebra over Cp. Introduction The Jacobian conjecture (JC), \ufb01rst proposed by O.-H. Keller in 1939 [6] and later included among Smale\u2019s problems, concerns the invertibility of polynomial maps over a commutative ring R under the assumption that their Jacobian determinant is a unit in the polynomial ring. Given a polynomial map F = (f1, . . . , fn) \u2208R[X1, . . . , Xn]n, its Jacobian matrix is de\ufb01ned by JF = \u0012 \u2202fi \u2202Xj \u0013 1\u2264i,j\u2264n . The conjecture, referred to as JC(R, n), asserts the following: If F \u2208R[X1, . . . , Xn]n satis\ufb01es det JF \u2208R[X1, . . . , Xn]\u00d7, then there exists G \u2208R[X1, . . . , Xn]n such that F \u25e6G = G \u25e6F = (X1, . . . , Xn). JC(R, n) In this paper, JC(R) refers to the conjunction of JC(R, n) for all n \u22651. The existing results on the Jacobian conjecture depend on the characteristic of the ring R. Here, R is said to have characteristic c, where c is a nonnegative integer, if the kernel of the unique homomorphism Z \u2192R is the ideal c Z. \u2022 Characteristic zero case: E. Connell and L. van den Dries [3], together with H. Bass, E. Mutchnik, and D. Wright [1], proved that for any integral domains R and S of characteristic zero, JC(R) is equivalent to JC(S).
