Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe2 single crystals as a function of tem- perature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resis- tivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe2, we find an isotropic \u2206\u03bb(T) \u223cT \u03b1 power-law tempera- ture dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for T \u2264Tc/3 with \u03b1 < 2, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance Rs(T) \u223cT \u03b1R with \u03b1R < 2. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss. I. INTRODUCTION UTe2 is a remarkable heavy Fermion superconductor near the edge of ferromagnetism, which shows evidence of spin-triplet pairing [1], including extraordinarily high critical fields with multiple superconducting phases, as well as re-entrant and orphan superconducting phases [2, 3]. UTe2 has an orthorhombic crystal structure with D2h point group symmetry. Early generation samples (CVT1, Tc \u223c1.6 K), grown with a chemical vapor trans- port (CVT) method [4], show evidence of time reversal invariance (TRI) breaking in the superconducting state. Two transitions in specific heat and a non-zero polar Kerr effect which onsets near Tc have been observed [5]. Elec- trodynamic properties of CVT1 samples are consistent with point nodal behavior of the superconducting gap [6\u20138]. Similarly, thermodynamic properties are also con- sistent with nodal behavior in UTe2 [1, 5, 9]. The CVT growth method has been improved to produce samples with higher transition temperatures (CVT2, Tc \u22722 K). These samples show only one su- perconducting transition [10]. There is now a genera- tion of molten salt flux (MSF) grown samples with high RRR \u223c100 (MSF1, Tc \u22482.1 K), which likewise, shows only one superconducting transition [11, 12]. Polar Kerr measurements have also been performed on single transi- tion samples grown with both CVT2 and MSF1 methods, which do not show evidence of TRI breaking in the su- perconducting state [13]. Muon spin relaxation (\u00b5SR) measurements also show no evidence of TRI breaking for MSF grown samples [14]. For these CVT2 and MSF1 crystals, Tc increases with RRR, but saturates for RRR \u227350 [10\u201312]. If UTe2 is a simple p-wave superconduc- tor, then ordinary disorder should suppress Tc; hence, higher-Tc crystals should imply higher quality (less dis- ordered) materials. In actuality, this is not the case as samples of the same Tc can have a variety of RRR values [10\u201312]. Numerous studies have been performed on the CVT2 and MSF1 samples to determine the specific single com- ponent order parameter of UTe2; however, there is no agreement. Thermal conductivity has been measured vs. temperature and applied magnetic field for both CVT and MSF grown UTe2 samples [9, 15]. Hayes et. al. find that the extrapolated zero temperature thermal conduc- tivity to temperature ratio shows a rapid increase with magnetic field for very low fields, which is indicative of nodal superconductivity. They conclude that UTe2 is specifically a B1u (nodes along the kz direction) or B2u (nodes along the ky direction) pairing symmetry. Suet- sugu et. al., however, do not observe this behavior when performing the same measurements, concluding an Au (fully gapped) pairing symmetry. A B1u pairing symme- try has also been concluded from measurements of the Josephson coupling between UTe2 and an s-wave super- conductor [16], and a B2u pairing symmetry has also been arXiv:2502.07955v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 11 Feb 2025"
