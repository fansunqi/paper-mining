  "abstract": "It is still not known whether a hyperbolic 3-manifold admits an angle structure or not. We consider angle structures with area-curvature (A, k) on triangulated pseudo 3-manifolds M in this article. A sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of such angle structures is established. As a consequence, any compact hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary admits an angle structure. We also derive certain topological information of M from the existence of such angle structures. 1 Introduction In the 1990s, Casson and Rivin (see [12, 20] or [4] for a self-contained exposition) dis- covered a powerful technique for solving Thurston\u2019s hyperbolic gluing equations. By introducing the concept of angle structures on an ideally triangulated 3-manifold M, they proved that if a maximal volume angle structure exists, it provides solutions to Thurston\u2019s gluing equations, thereby yielding a hyperbolic structure on M. Using theories and tools such as normal surfaces, the connection between angle structures and three-dimensional topology is increasingly being discovered. We refer to [8, 10, 11, 13, 20] for examples. For a triangulated pseudo 3-manifold (M, T ), Luo-Tillmann [16] further developed the concept of (generalized) angle structures with area-curvature (A, \u03ba). Assuming A \u22640, a necessary condition for the existence of such angle structures was established in [16]. In this article, we show that the necessary condition in [16] is also sufficient for the existence of such angle structures, by assuming that (M, T ) admits a semi-angle structure. Let {\u03c31, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3n} be the tetrahedra in a triangulated compact pseudo 3-manifold (M, T ). A normal surface F in (M, T ) is an embedded surface, so as its intersection with any tetrahedron \u03c3i is a disjoint union of normal disks. There are 7 types of normal disks in each tetrahedron \u03c3i, including 3 quadrilaterals and 4 triangles. The normal coordinate of F is an ordered normal disk types (q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q3n, t1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t4n) \u2208R7n. These coordinates satisfy a system of compatibility equations with solution space denoted by C(M, T ). By taking the contributions of each normal disk ti or qj to the Euler characteristic of F, a function \u03c7\u2217(tj) or \u03c7\u2217(qj) can be introduced. Linearly extending those \u03c7\u2217(ti) and \u03c7\u2217(qj), the generalized Euler characteristic function \u03c7\u2217(\u00b7) is well-defined on R7n (see 1 arXiv:2502.11397v1 [math.GT] 17 Feb 2025"
