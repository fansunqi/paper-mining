  "title": "A Very Young Tau-Herculid Meteor Cluster Observed During a 2022 Shower Outburst.pdf",
  "abstract": "Context. To date only very few meteor clusters have been instrumentally recorded. This means that every new detection is an important contribution to the understanding of these phenomena, which are thought to be evidence of the meteoroid fragmentation in the Solar System. Aims. On 31st May 2022, at 6:48:55 UT, a cluster consisting of 52 meteors was detected within 8.5 seconds during a predicted outburst of the \u03c4-Herculid meteor shower. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the atmospheric trajectories of the meteors and use the collected information to deduce the origin of the cluster. Methods. The meteors were recorded by two video cameras during an airborne campaign. Due to only the single station observation, their trajectories were estimated under the assumption that they belonged to the meteor shower. The mutual positions of the fragments, together with their photometric masses, was used to model the processes leading to the formation of the cluster. Results. The physical properties of the cluster meteors are very similar to the properties of the \u03c4-Herculids. This \ufb01nding con\ufb01rms the assumption of the shower membership used for the computation of atmospheric trajectories. This was the third cluster that we have studied in detail, but the \ufb01rst one where we do not see the mass separation of the particles. The cluster is probably less than 2.5 days old, which is too short for such a complete mass separation. Such an age would imply disintegration due to thermal stress. However, we cannot rule out an age of only a few hours, which would allow for other fragmentation mechanisms. Key words. Meteorites, meteors, meteoroids 1. Introduction The \u03c4-Herculid meteor shower1 is a relatively weak meteor shower, which typically displays minimal activity. Only a hand- ful of photographic and video orbits have been reported in the past (Rao 2021). It changed after the breakup of its parent body, comet 73/P Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, which occurred in 1995 (Crovisier et al. 1996). Several authors have modelled the orbital evolution of the dust particles released during this fragmentation process and predicted a meteor outburst or even a storm on 31 May 2022 (for a review see Ye & Vaubaillon 2022). An outburst did indeed occur at the predicted time (e.g. Egal et al. 2023). Meteor outbursts or meteor storms are events that o\ufb00er a higher chance of detecting meteor clusters. This phenomenon was observed in the case of the Leonid meteor shower storms at the turn of the century, when three such events were reported by Japanese astronomers (Kinoshita et al. 1999; Watanabe et al. 2002, 2003). Another case was a statistical grouping of Leonid meteors above chance level during maxima activity in 1999 (T\u00f3th & Kla\u02c7cka 2004). The paper of Watanabe et al. (2003) sug- gests that thermal stressing of very fragile cometary dust is the most likely process leading to the formation of the clusters. This was recently con\ufb01rmed by \u02c7Capek et al. (2022), who analysed in detail a cluster of 10 September \u01eb-Perseid meteors observed over 1 061 TAH code in IAU MDC database the Czech Republic in 2016 and showed that thermal stress of fragile cometary material was the most likely process leading to the formation of the cluster. They found that the age of the cluster was only about 2.3 days. Another event with the same formation scenario was a huge meteor cluster observed in northern Europe in 2022, consisting of at least 22 meteors (Koten et al. 2024). In this case, the age of the cluster was 10.6\u00b11.7 days. It was a sporadic meteor cluster on cometary orbit. For both clusters, the ejection velocities were found to be very low, in the order of 0.1 m s\u22121. There are no more meteor clusters that have been analysed in detail up to now. It is obvious that data on more clusters are needed to determine whether the thermal stress alone is the cause of the cluster formation, or whether other scenarios are possible. These include fragmentation due to fast rotation and collisions with other particles ( \u02c7Capek et al. 2022). Because meteor clusters are rare and unpredictable events, it is necessary to take every opportunity to increase the chances of detecting them. Predicted meteor outbursts are one of them. Al- though the main reason for observing the predicted \u03c4-Herculid meteor outburst was to detect the particles release from the par- ent comet during its disintegration in 1995, increased likelihood of the cluster detection was also one of the objectives. This has indeed happened. A large meteor cluster was recorded by cameras on board an aircraft conducting a research Article number, page 1 of 9"
