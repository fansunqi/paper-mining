Machine learning is now increasingly being used to accelerate the modelling of PCMs, and yet it remains challenging to simultane- ously reach the length and time scales required to simulate the operation of real-world PCM devices. Here, we show how ultra-fast machine-learned interatomic potentials, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, enable simulations of PCMs reflecting applications in devices with excellent scalability on high-performance compu- ting platforms. We report full-cycle simulations\u2014including the time-consuming crystalli- sation process (from digital \u201czeroes\u201d to \u201cones\u201d)\u2014thus representing the entire program- ming cycle for cross-point memory devices. We also showcase a simulation of full-cycle operations, relevant to neuromorphic computing, in a mushroom-type device geometry. Our work provides a springboard for the atomistic modelling of PCM-based memory and neuromorphic computing devices\u2014and, more widely, it illustrates the power of highly efficient ACE ML models for materials science and engineering."
