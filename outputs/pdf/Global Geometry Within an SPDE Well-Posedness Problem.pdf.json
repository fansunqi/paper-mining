  "abstract": "On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter \u03b1 \u22650 to study the well-posedness of the Parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on \u03b1 similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. The argument was made in direct mode, showing that it is possible to bypass Fourier analysis, which was used in all previous work with rough initial conditions. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using the good structure of our noise, we obtain new exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.

We consider the formal Cauchy problem (\u0000\u2202t + 1 2 \u25b3M \u0001 u(t, x) = \u03b2u(t, x) \u00b7 W, (t, x) \u2208R+ \u00d7 M, u(0, x) = \u00b5, (1) where \u03b2 > 0 is a constant, \u25b3M = \u2212div(grad) is the Laplace-Beltrami operator (we follow the geome- ter convention with the negative sign), and \u00b5 is a finite measure on M. We say that a random field {u(t, x)}(t,x)\u2208R+\u00d7M is a mild solution if it satisfies u(t, x) = \u02c6 M Pt(x, y)\u00b5(dy) + \u03b2 \u02c6 t 0 \u02c6 M Pt\u2212s(x, y)u(s, y)W(dy, ds) = J0(t, x) + \u03b2I(t, x) (2) where Pt(x, y) is the heat kernel on M and J0(t, x) := \u00b4 M Pt(x, y)\u00b5(dy) is the homogeneous solution to the heat equation. The second integral I(t, x) is to be understood in the sense of It\u02c6o-Walsh [Wal86]. The It\u02c6o-Walsh solution theory for (1) has been successful for many purposes of study. However, the white noise becomes too singular to apply the Walsh theory when space dimension is greater than 1; and solu- tions have been constructed in the Stratonovich sense via renormalization techniques (see [HL15; HL18] 1 arXiv:2502.04572v1 [math.PR] 6 Feb 2025"
