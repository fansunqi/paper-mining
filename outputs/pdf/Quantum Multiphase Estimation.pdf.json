While much of the research has concentrated on estimating a single phase, the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases can yield significantly enhanced sensitivities when using specially tailored input quantum states. This work reviews recent theoretical and experimental advancements in the parallel estimation of multiple arbitrary phases. We highlight strategies for constructing optimal measurement protocols and discuss the experimental platforms best suited for implementing these techniques. I. INTRODUCTION Quantum metrology has attracted significant interest in re- cent years for its capability to estimate unknown parameters with a precision beyond the reach of classical methods [1\u2013 7]. Research, both theoretical and experimental, has largely centered on the estimation of a single phase\u2013a key paradigm, especially in photonic systems, which are the leading platform for these studies. For single-parameter estimation, the ultimate sensitivity bounds and explicit conditions for their saturation are well known [8, 9]. In this scenario, classical methods are bound by the standard quantum limit (SQL) [10], which dic- tates that the estimation error scales as \ud835\udf08\u22121/2, where \ud835\udf08is the number of independent measurements performed. However, by leveraging quantum resources, this limit can be overcome, achieving a higher precision that follows the Heisenberg limit (HL), where the error scales more favorably as \ud835\udf08\u22121 [11\u201313]. Several proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated phase estimation below the SQL limit in various systems, such as interferometers [14\u201319], atomic clocks [20, 21], and magnetometers [22\u201325]. This quantum enhancement has been strikingly demonstrated in the detection of gravitational waves [26, 27] and is in the realm of modern quantum sens- ing [28, 29]. However, a substantial class of problems resists efficient framing as the estimation of a single parameter. This multipa- rameter scenario, which involves the simultaneous estimation of two or more parameters [30\u201333], represents a relatively recent frontier that holds significant potential for diverse sens- ing applications, such as measuring inherently vector quanti- ties, including fields [34\u201338], displacements [39\u201341], and rota- tions [42\u201344]. Recent advances have concluded that estimat- ing multiple parameters simultaneously may achieve greater sensitivity than estimating them individually [45], and have focused on the roles of entanglement [46], as well as the im- pact of noise [47\u201350]. Specific examples have been studied, encompassing measurement strategies for problems including measurement on biological systems [51], phase imaging [52\u2013 54], spectroscopy and frequency measurements [55\u201357], quan- tum sensing networks [58\u201361], joint estimation of phase and loss [62, 63], phase and phase diffusion [64\u201367], phase and indistinguishability [68], and estimation tasks with incomplete knowledge of the measurement device itself [69]. However, in this multiparameter scenario there are still sev- eral open questions. For instance, while the single-parameter case is well understood, few recipes to saturate the ultimate bounds are known in the multiparameter case [70\u201375]. Here, due to possible noncommutativity of the quantum measure- ments required to simultaneously optimize the estimation of different parameters, it may not be possible to optimally esti- mate all parameters at the same time. The proper definition of general quantum bounds still requires additional investiga- tions. To effectively investigate these multiparameter tasks, it is essential to identify a specific scenario and a corresponding experimental platform. The multiphase problem, where the parameters to be estimated consist of a set of optical phases, offers such a scenario. Numerous theoretical studies have ex- plored this direction [76\u201384]. Recent findings have established necessary and sufficient conditions for determining the optimal projective measurements for pure states [85]. Additionally, ad- vancements have been made in formulating generalized matrix bounds [86] and identifying optimal states [87]. In this paper, we review these capabilities as well as the latest experimental implementations. II. BACKGROUND Light is often used as the probe in sensing tasks. Perhaps the simplest case is the detection of specimens by absorption [88]: a specimen\u2019s distinct features allow one to identify the pres- ence of a compound by looking at the absorption spectrum. Depending on the target compound, it may be more convenient to detect its fluorescence when pumped with light at shorter wavelengths. A different approach employs an interferometric technique. Here, the medium is not directly probed, as for the spectro- scopic approach; instead, its properties are inferred by observ- ing the relative phase in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, or in an equivalent arrangement. One of the arms serves as a reference, while the second either contains or is in close con- arXiv:2502.07873v1 [quant-ph] 11 Feb 2025"
