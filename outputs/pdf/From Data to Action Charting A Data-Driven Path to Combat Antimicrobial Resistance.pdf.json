  "title": "From Data to Action Charting A Data-Driven Path to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance.pdf",
  "abstract": "Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microbes are becoming increasingly common in healthcare as they make modern medicines ineffective and result in serious problems. The cause of AMR is considered related to antibiotic production either in a natural environment or by synthetic processes and the impact of antibiotics on bacteria evolution. However, it is challenging to quantify factors affecting AMR transmissions for effective decision-making. As the data related to AMR has been increasingly collected, data-driven methods have been increasingly used and are promising in providing mean- ingful clues for identifying AMR causes and effective treatment methods. In this paper, we review AMR works from the data analytics and machine learning perspective, in an attempt to summarise the state-of-the-art and give insight into the problem space. In more detail, we explore the diverse as- pects of AMR, including surveillance, prediction, drug discovery, stewardship, and driver analysis. Then, we elaborate on the interaction of these aspects and the common data-related methodologies employed. For data handling, we have discussed sources, methods, and challenges in collecting and analyzing AMR-related data, while underlining the importance of standardization and interop- erability. Further, this article surveys data analysis techniques, from statistical analysis to machine learning/deep learning, illustrating their application in tackling AMR challenges. Mainly aiming at data challenges, including noises and biases introduced in data preparation (e.g., data cleaning and privacy-preserving) and modelling phases, the paper also highlights strategies (i.e., denoising and debiasing) for mitigating data challenges to improve AMR research performance and results in terms of fairness and robustness. In conclusion, the paper focuses on problems in the intersection of AMR and data science, stressing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, especially arousing the awareness of noise and bias in data-driven approaches in the ongoing battle against AMR. It points towards promising paths for further exploration, innovation, robustness and fairness in AMR research. Keywords Antimicrobial resistance, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Data management, Privacy 1 Introduction Antibiotics are often grouped by their mechanisms of action, such as blocking protein synthesis, disrupting folate biosynthesis, changing cell wall construction, compromising the cell membrane integrity and affecting DNA repli- cation [93, 25]. These antibiotics, whether created in labs or found in nature, serve as the primary defence against bacterial infections. However, bacteria employ a series of strategies in response to resist these antibiotics, including inactivating antibiotics through enzymatic degradation, altering the antibiotic target, modifying cell membrane perme- ability, and using efflux pumps to maintain intracellular antibiotic concentrations of antibiotics below inhibitory levels [25]. Moreover, the gene transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) further aggravates this challenge [92]. Resistance can be gained through vertical and horizontal gene transfers, of which the former is the transfer from parent to off- spring, and the latter is the transfer of genetic material, including antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs), from cell to \u2217Corresponding author: Qian Fu (qian.fu@data61.csiro.au) arXiv:2502.00061v1 [cs.LG] 30 Jan 2025"
