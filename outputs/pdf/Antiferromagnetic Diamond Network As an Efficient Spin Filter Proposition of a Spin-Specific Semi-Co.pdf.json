  "abstract": "Maiti1, \u2020 1Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, 203 Barrackpore Trunk Road, Kolkata-700 108, India (Dated: February 18, 2025) We propose, for the \ufb01rst time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-speci\ufb01c semiconducting behavior. We describe the anti- ferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at di\ufb00erent lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin \ufb01ltration relies on the speci\ufb01c arrangement of mag- netic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic \ufb02ux threading each plaquette. Due to the network\u2019s geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate local- ized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-speci\ufb01c p-type and n-type semiconducting behavior. Our \ufb01ndings o\ufb00er a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks. I. INTRODUCTION Antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems are emerging as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic tech- nology1\u20138. Over a decade ago, when researchers \ufb01rst incorporated electron spin alongside charge in micro- electronic devices, ferromagnetic (FM) materials were the preferred choice9\u201314. Ferromagnetic materials fa- cilitate global spin polarization due to their long-range magnetic ordering. However, as technology advances, there is a growing demand for enhanced functionality, reduced power consumption, and miniaturized device ar- chitectures. In this context, AFM spintronic elements present several advantages over conventional FM materi- als. AFM systems can function as multilevel switches15,16 and, crucially, do not generate stray fringe \ufb01elds, en- suring that their performance remains una\ufb00ected by ex- ternal magnetic perturbations17. Moreover, they en- able electronic writing pulse frequencies in the terahertz regime5,18 and exhibit higher ordering temperatures com- pared to FM materials, allowing operation near room temperature3,4. Given these advantageous properties, AFM materials have been established as e\ufb03cient com- ponents in spintronic applications4\u20136. In spin-based electronic devices, a fundamental objec- tive is to spatially separate spin-up and spin-down elec- trons along their transport path, enabling the utilization of spin degrees of freedom alongside charge transport. Achieving this requires the presence of spin-dependent scattering within the system. When an electron moves at a su\ufb03ciently high velocity, the interaction between its angular momentum and spin e\ufb00ectively generates a magnetic \ufb01eld in its rest frame. This phenomenon, known as spin-orbit interaction (SOI), produces an ef- fective magnetic \ufb01eld that facilitates the separation of spin channels19,20. In solid-state systems, two primary types of SOI are typically considered: Rashba and Dres- selhaus interactions. The Rashba interaction arises due to structural inversion asymmetry in the con\ufb01ning poten- tial21, while the Dresselhaus interaction originates from bulk inversion asymmetry22. Although SOI-based spin- dependent scattering mechanisms o\ufb00er several advan- tages, a signi\ufb01cant limitation is the generally weak spin- orbit coupling strength in most materials23. This weak interaction reduces the e\ufb03ciency of spin channel separa- tion, making it challenging to achieve high spin currents and e\ufb00ective spin \ufb01ltration over a reasonable bias win- dow. Given the inherent limitations of spin-orbit-coupled and ferromagnetic materials, recent breakthrough stud- ies on antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems suggest that these materials o\ufb00er a more suitable and reliable plat- form for the future development of spintronic devices with advanced functionalities. In general, the transmis- sion spectra for spin-up and spin-down electrons are iden- tical in AFM materials, resulting in no net spin current unless speci\ufb01c symmetry-breaking conditions are intro- duced. One approach to achieving spin polarization in AFM systems is to introduce asymmetric hopping in se- lective regions, thereby creating distinct transport envi- ronments for spin-up and spin-down electrons. Alterna- tively, a disparity in onsite potential can enable electrons of di\ufb00erent spins to propagate through separate energy channels24. Various methods have been proposed to in- duce asymmetric hopping in di\ufb00erent geometric con\ufb01g- urations. Additionally, chirality combined with an ex- ternal electric \ufb01eld can create spin-dependent potential energy variations in AFM molecular systems25,26. The e\ufb03ciency of spin \ufb01ltration is enhanced in AFM helical structures with long-range hopping order. However, in the absence of helicity or an applied electric \ufb01eld, spin separation is completely suppressed. We seek a system where spin channel separation can be achieved without the application of an external electric \ufb01eld, even in the presence of symmetric hopping. In this work, we demonstrate that a mesoscopic chain with a spe-"
