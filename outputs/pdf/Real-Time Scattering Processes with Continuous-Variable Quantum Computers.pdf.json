  "abstract": "We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on (1+1)-dimensional \u03c64 scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscil- lators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian opera- tions for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the \u03c64 Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influ- ence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC\u2019s scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories. arXiv:2502.01767v1 [quant-ph] 3 Feb 2025"
