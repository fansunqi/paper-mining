  "abstract": ". Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant se- curity risk to organizations and industries. These attacks often lead to severe data breaches and compromise the system for a long time. Mitigat- ing these sophisticated attacks is highly challenging due to the stealthy and persistent nature of APTs. Machine learning models are often em- ployed to tackle this challenge by bringing automation and scalability to APT detection. Nevertheless, these intelligent methods are data-driven, and thus, highly affected by the quality and relevance of input data. This paper aims to analyze measurements considered when recording network traffic and conclude which features contribute more to detecting APT samples. To do this, we study the features associated with various APT cases and determine their importance using a machine learning frame- work. To ensure the generalization of our findings, several feature se- lection techniques are employed and paired with different classifiers to evaluate their effectiveness. Our findings provide insights into how APT detection can be enhanced in real-world scenarios.

The financial loss, rep- utational damage, and at times compromises in national security caused by cyber-attacks make cybersecurity a growing concern for businesses across all sectors [1, 5]. Confidence in digital systems is maintained by protecting digital assets and ensuring the availability of data, integrity, and privacy. Conventional defenses struggle with coping with the rising intensity and scale of cyber-attacks, both in number and sophistication [8,12,18]. Thus, sophisticated and adaptive \u22c6Submitted to CSCI\u2013RTCW 2024. arXiv:2502.07207v1 [cs.CR] 11 Feb 2025"
