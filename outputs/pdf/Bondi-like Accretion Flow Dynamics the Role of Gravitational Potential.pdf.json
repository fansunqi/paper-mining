  "abstract": "The formation of massive black holes and their coevolution with host galaxies are pivotal areas of modern astrophysics. Spherical accretion onto a central point mass serves as a foundational frame- work in cosmological simulations, semianalytical models, and observational studies. This work extends the classical spherical accretion model by incorporating the gravitational potential of host galaxies, including contributions from stellar components and dark matter halos. Numerical solutions spanning parsec-scale to event-horizon-scale regimes reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size of the dark matter halo. Adding low angular momentum to the accreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion, with mass accretion rates converging towards the Bondi rate. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Due to the presence of dark matter, the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of more than \u223c%100 in comparison to analogous hydrodynamic solutions. These findings underscore the critical role of stellar and dark matter gravitational poten- tials in shaping the dynamics and accretion rates of quasi-spherical flows, providing new insights into astrophysical accretion processes.

INTRODUCTION Almost every galaxy hosts a super massive black hole (SMBH). Black hole accretion systems, such as X- ray binariess (XRBs) or active galactic nucleis (AGNs), have the capacity to release significant amounts of en- ergy into the interstellar medium. The mass of a black hole is closely correlated with various properties of its host galaxy, indicating a co-evolution between the cen- tral black hole (BH) and its host galaxy Tremaine et al. (2002); Kormendy & Ho (2013). However, it remains largely unknown how black holes are connected to their larger-scale environments and host dark matter halos. It has been suggested that several mechanisms drive gas into the galaxy\u2019s center, eventually triggering AGN activity, which depends on either the galaxy\u2019s cosmic r.ranjbar@ipm.ir environments or the dark matter halos that host them Hopkins et al. (2008). Understanding these mechanisms could also provide insights into galaxy cluster formation, particularly for low-luminosity AGNs, where accretion dynamics deviate from standard models. In recent decades, numerous analytical models have been developed to elucidate the fundamental physical processes occurring within the accretion flow. The sim- plest model for accretion is spherical accretion, which assumes a spherically symmetric inflow Bondi (1952) ac- cretion model, while being a useful mathematical con- struct, represents an idealized scenario. In reality, an- gular momentum, even if minimal, plays a key role in determining accretion dynamics. Deviations from ideal- ized spherical flows, especially in the presence of small angular momentum or environmental complexities re- mains an important avenue for research. The classical Bondi problem has been instrumental in analyzing accretion onto primordial black holes in the arXiv:2502.12101v1 [astro-ph.HE] 17 Feb 2025"
