  "abstract": "We consider the reachability relation of pushdown systems whose pushdown holds a Mazurkiewicz trace instead of just a word as in classical systems. Under two natural conditions on the transition structure of such systems, we prove that the reachability relation is lc-rational, a new notion that restricts the class of rational trace relations. We also develop the theory of these lc-rational re- lations to the point where they allow to infer that forwards-reachability of a trace-pushdown system preserves the rationality and backwards-reachability the recognizability of sets of con\ufb01gurations. As a consequence, we obtain that it is decidable whether one recognizable set of con\ufb01gurations can be reached from some rational set of con\ufb01gurations. All our constructions are polynomial (as- suming the dependence alphabet to be \ufb01xed). These \ufb01ndings generalize results by Caucal on classical pushdown systems (namely the rationality of the reachability relation of such systems) and com- plement results by Zetzsche (namely the decidability for arbitrary transition structures under severe restrictions on the dependence alphabet).
