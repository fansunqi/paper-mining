  "abstract": "This study is motivated by two key considerations: the significant benefits mobile applications offer individuals and businesses, and the limited empir- ical research on usability challenges. To address this gap, we conducted structured interviews with twelve experts to identify common usability is- sues. Our findings highlight the top five concerns related to: information architecture, user interface design, performance, interaction patterns, and aesthetics. In addition, we identify five key directions for future research: usability in AI-powered mobile applications, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), multimodal interactions, personalized mobile ecosys- tems, and accessibility. Our study provides insights into emerging usability challenges and trends, contributing to both the theory and practice of mobile human-computer interaction. Keywords: mobile, usability, issue, countermeasures 1. Introduction Mobile applications have become an increasingly important part of our business and personal lives for their convenience, accessibility and function- ality [1]. In business, mobile applications increase productivity by giving employees on-the-go access to critical tools and resources [2]. They also improve communication through features such as instant messaging [3] and video conferencing [4], and streamline processes such as project management [5] or customer relationship management [6].
