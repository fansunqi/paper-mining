  "abstract": "\u2014In this work, we describe and demonstrate a novel Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) driven methodology that allows measurement data from \u2018non-ideal\u2019 silicon wafers to be used for re-centering a room temperature-based Process Design Kit (PDK) to cryogenic temperatures. This comprehensive approach holds promise for advancing cryogenic CMOS design in the absence of foundry supplied cryogenic PDKs. Index Terms\u2014Cryogenic, CMOS, TCAD, Compact model, PDK Re-centering I. INTRODUCTION Cryogenic CMOS design has attracted huge interest for reducing the power dissipation in data centers by operating at cryogenic temperatures and for interfacing CMOS analog and digital circuits to the quantum bits (qubits) in the same cryogenic chamber [1], [2] in quantum computing research. An important hurdle is that the foundry PDKs are designed for room temperature operation and at the time of executing this work, and to the best of our knowledge, no PDKs are available for design at cryo temperature. Measurements at cryogenic temperatures can be used to re-center [3] the room temperature PDK to cryogenic temperatures. However, this is a complicated process due to discrepancies between the characteristics of the Typical/Typical (TT) transistors from the foundry PDK and the transistors measured on the silicon wafers. The foundry provides no guarantee to customers that the fabricated devices will have the same characteristics as the TT transistors in the PDK. Instead, the foundry only guarantees that the transistor characteristics on the fabricated wafers will be in-between the characteristics of the fast/fast (FF) and slow/slow (SS) corner transistor characteristics in the PDK. While several methods have been proposed to address cryogenic CMOS modeling, they usually are limited to direct extraction of compact models using data from a few cryogenic temperature measurements of one or in some cases a few devices. Some such recent efforts are: cryogenic modeling of 28nm bulk CMOS tuning two parameters of the PSP model [4], BSIM-CMG model extraction for FinFETs [5] etc. How- ever, the simplistic approach of fitting limited measurements and extracting a compact model cannot produce a cryogenic PDK as the measured die can be anywhere between FF, T.

While for room temperature (RT) models, measurements across many die/wafers/lots are performed and PDK is extracted, but for cryogenic CMOS this is not as easy and is also much more expensive (an example of cryogenic PDK from scratch has been reported in [6], but that is for an old 130nm CMOS technology). Further, this simplistic approach has been usually targeted at a specific device architecture or technology node, which is useful, but has limited applicability for real circuit design, in contrast to the generic approach that we have developed. This paper outlines a procedure to accurately re-center room temperature foundry PDKs for supporting circuit design at cryogenic temperatures, using a combination of a minimum set of experimental cryogenic measurements of CMOS tran- sistors on test chips and TCAD simulations. The methodology delivers PDK quality models for TT, SS, FF, SF and FS transistors and include statistical variability (mismatch). A flowchart summarizing the entire methodology is shown in Fig. 1 (corners skipped for simplicity). The next sections describe the various steps involved in re-centering procedure.

TCAD DECK CALIBRATION FOR TT TRANSISTOR The initial step in the PDK Re-Centering process is the creation of a TCAD deck, starting with the generation of a TCAD device structure of the typical-typical (TT) transistor, considering the room temperature PDK data (SPICE model generated). The structure is created using process simulations [7]), and device simulations are performed under the drift- diffusion formalism [8].
