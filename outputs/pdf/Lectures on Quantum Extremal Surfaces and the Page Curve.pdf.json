  "abstract": "This article is a write-up of pedagogical lectures delivered at the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics online winter school held in January 2021, and also as part of the Quantum Information, Quantum Field Theory and Gravity program held at ICTS, Bengaluru, in August 2024. The topics covered include a brief derivation of Hawking radiation from the perspective of correlation functions, a description of entropy paradoxes in the eternal black hole, and details of the associated entanglement island computations in two-dimensional models. arXiv:2502.01933v1 [hep-th] 4 Feb 2025"
