  "abstract": "Dilatancy, driven by interparticle friction, causes the packing to expand, while particle alignment tends to densify it. We examine the influence of friction, particle aspect ratio, and initial packing conditions on the steady-state particle alignment and packing density. Unlike spherical particles, non-spherical particles with higher AR exhibit either dilatancy or compaction under shear, leading to spontaneous heaping or depression formation. We analyzed the evolution of packing density to identify whether dilatancy or compression prevails within the shear band. Keywords: shear, non-spherical particles, packing density, spontaneous heaping I. INTRODUCTION Granular materials composed of non-spherical parti- cles display complex packing and flow behaviors shaped by particle geometry, size, and frictional interactions [1\u2013 7]. High friction inhibits particle motion, leading to less dense packings, while low friction facilitates particle re- arrangement, resulting in denser packings [8\u201311]. For example, non-frictional spheres with friction coefficient \u00b5 = 0 reach a packing density of approximately 0.64, which decreases to around 0.55 at \u00b5 = 0.5 [12\u201317]. Un- der gravity, non-spherical particles, such as elongated grains (sticks), typically pack less densely than spheres [1, 12, 13, 18]. When subjected to tapping, shearing, or vibration, sticks can align and rearrange, resulting in increased packing density [19\u201324]. This alignment com- petes with dilatancy [25, 26], a concept first introduced by Reynolds in the late 19th century [27], which describes the volume expansion of material under shear due to par- ticle interaction and the resulting relative motion. Con- sequently, sheared sticks experience two opposite effects: particle alignment, which causes a localized depression in the shear zone as particles pack more densely, and dilatancy, which leads to localized heaping due to the materials\u2019 volume expansion [25, 28]. When non-spherical particles are sheared in a split- bottom shear cell, they exhibit heap formation driven by dilatancy and secondary flows [7, 29, 30]. Wortel et al. were the first to observe this phenomenon for a granulate of sticks, attributing the heap formation to the misalign- ment of the particles with the flow direction [31]. Both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal grains show this be- havior, with the heap surface rising approximately 30% higher than the initial filling, causing a depression of the surface above the shear band, a phenomenon not seen with spheres [28, 31, 32]. Secondary flows have been ex- tensively studied in Couette cells and split-bottom shear \u2217huzaif.rahim@fau.de cells filled by densely packed spheres [7, 29, 30], as well as non-spherical grains of aspect ratio 1 [33]. These studies have primarily focused on the effects of fill height, shear rate, and particle shapes on the dilatancy and secondary flows of non-elongated granular materials. However, the influence of friction and initial packing properties on the steady-state structure of sheared elongated particles in granular media remains largely unexplored. Granular flow in cylindrical split-bottom shear cells has been studied to understand the influence of particle shape and material properties on secondary flows, orien- tational order, and dilatancy [25, 32, 34, 35]. Building upon these results, recent studies have employed linear split-bottom shear cells (LSC) with periodic boundary conditions along the flow direction [28, 29, 36, 37]. De- spite the finite domain size, simulations employing peri- odic boundary conditions enable the study of infinitely extended systems by replicating the boundaries seam- lessly, thus capturing the system\u2019s bulk behavior by sup- pressing effects due to the finite system size. In the current paper, we report simulations of LSC. We investigate the impact of the particle shape, friction, and initial packing on the structure of granular flows. We analyze the steady-state packing density, surface profile, and the evolution of particle alignment within the shear band. The interplay between aspect ratio (AR) and fric- tion (\u00b5) is examined to understand their influence on the steady-state surface profile of sheared sticks. II. NUMERICAL METHODS AND SETUP A. Numerical methods We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simula- tions using the open-source code MercuryDPM [38, 39], which includes the multisphere algorithm [40], and ad- vanced force approximations [41\u201343], making it a versa- tile platform for DEM simulations. arXiv:2502.13739v1 [cond-mat.soft] 19 Feb 2025"
