  "abstract": ". Let X be a compact metric space. By 2X we denote the hyperspace of all closed and non-empty subsets of X endowed with the Hausdor\ufb00metric. Let f : X \u2192X be a continuous function. In this paper we study some topological properties of the hyperspace \u03c9(f), the collection of all omega limits sets \u03c9(x,f) with x \u2208X. We prove the following: i) If X has no isolated points, then, for every continuous function f : X \u2192X, int2X (\u03c9(f)) = \u2205. ii) If X is a dendrite for which every arc contains a free arc and f : X \u2192X is transitive, then the hyperspace \u03c9(f) is totally disconnected. iii) Let D\u221ebe the Wazewski\u2019s universal dendrite. Then there exists a transitive continuous function f : D\u221e\u2192D\u221efor which the hyperspace \u03c9(f) contains an arc; hence, \u03c9(f) is not totally disconnected. 1. Introduction A map is a continuous function. Let N denote the set of positive integers. Let X be a compact metric space. Given p \u2208X and \u03b5 > 0, let B(p, \u03b5) denote the \u03b5-ball in X around p. Also, for a given subset A of X, the symbols clX(A), intX(A) and bdX(A) denote the closure, the interior and the boundary of the set A in X, respectively. A compact metric space X is said to be totally disconnected if for each pair of distinct points x, y \u2208X, there exist open subsets U and V of X such that x \u2208U, y \u2208V , U \u2229V = \u2205and X = U \u222aV . A dynamical system is a pair (X, f) where X is a compact metric space and f : X \u2192X is a map. Given a dynamical system (X, f), we denote by f n the n-th iterate of f; that is, f 0 = idX (the identity map) and f n = f \u25e6f n\u22121 if n \u22651. For each x \u2208X, the orbit of x under f is the sequence o(x, f) = {x, f(x), f 2(x), . . .}. A point x \u2208X is called periodic if there is k \u2208N such that f k(x) = x. Given a periodic point x \u2208X, the period of x is the least positive integer m such that f m(x) = x; when m = 1 we say that x is a \ufb01xed point. A non-empty subset A of X is called strongly invariant under f provided that f(A) = A. We de\ufb01ne the \u03c9-limit set of a point x \u2208X to be the set \u03c9(x, f) = \\ n\u2208N clX({f k(x) : k \u2265n}). Note that y \u2208\u03c9(x, f) if and only if there exists a sequence of natural numbers n1 < n2 < . . . such that lim i\u2192\u221ef ni(x) = y. It is well known that \u03c9(x, f) is a non-empty, closed and strongly invariant subset of X (see [4]). The map f : X \u2192X is Date: February 6, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation.
