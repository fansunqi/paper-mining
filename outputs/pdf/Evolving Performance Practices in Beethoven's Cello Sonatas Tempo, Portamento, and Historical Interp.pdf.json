  "title": "Evolving Performance Practices in Beethoven's Cello Sonatas Tempo, Portamento, and Historical Interp.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014 This paper examines the evolving performance practices of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s cello sonatas, with a partic- ular focus on tempo and portamento between 1930 and 2012. It integrates analyses of 22 historical recordings, advancements in recording technology to shed light on changes in interpretative approaches. By comparing Beethoven\u2019s metronome markings, as understood through contemporaries such as Czerny and Moscheles, with their application in modern performances, my research highlights notable deviations. These differences prove the challenges performers face in reconciling historical tempos with the demands of contemporary performance practice. My study pays special attention to the diminishing use of audible portamento in the latter half of the 20th century, contrasted with a gradual increase in tempo after 1970. This development is linked to broader cultural and pedagogical shifts, including the adoption of fingering techniques that reduce hand shifts, thereby facilitating greater technical precision at faster tempos. Nonetheless, my study identifies the persistence of \u201csilent porta- mento\u201d as an expressive device, allowing performers to retain stylistic expression without compromising rhythmic integrity. My paper offers valuable insights for performers and scholars alike, advocating a critical reassessment of Beethoven\u2019s tempo markings and the nuanced application of portamento in modern performance practice. I. METHODOLOGIES To achieve the results discussed in this paper, I employed a combination of audio analysis tools and techniques to inves- tigate tempo, time, and portamento in Beethoven\u2019s sonatas for piano and cello. These methodologies integrate traditional musicological approaches with computational tools, provid- ing a detailed and multifaceted analysis. Tempo and time were analysed using a dual approach. Performance recordings from 1930 to 2012 were segmented into sections and subsections. Beats-per-minute (BPM) were calculated for individual bars and averaged across sections, movements, and entire sonatas. This data was visualised through scatter plots, histograms, and tempographs, revealing trends in tempo evolution over time. Tools such as Audacity and Sonic Visualizer facilitated the extraction of BPM and duration metrics. Sonic Visualizer\u2019s spectrogram functional- ity enabled detailed temporal and spectral analysis, while its measurement tools allowed high-resolution timing analysis for specific passages. For portamento analysis, an innovative methodology was developed to address the challenges of polyphonic record- ings. While previous studies relied on qualitative annotations and small-scale analyses, this study introduced a quantitative approach incorporating two variables: sliding and silent portamento. Both were identified manually through auditory analysis and visualised using Sonic Visualizer\u2019s melodic spectrogram layer. To measure portamento length and steepness, spectrogram data was imported into the GNU Image Manipulation Pro- gram (GIMP). The slope of portamento slides was calculated using a gradient formula, enabling quantification of the speed and character of portamento transitions. Adjustments to spectrogram visibility and gain were necessary for older recordings, where spectral clarity was diminished due to analog-to-digital conversion artifacts. Annotated scores were transferred to Sibelius, where por- tamento occurrences were marked with symbols for slid- ing (wavy lines) and silent (dotted lines) portamento. This transcription enabled systematic comparison of portamento frequency and location across recordings. Data analysis using scatter plots with linear regressions assessed trends over time, revealing a decline in sliding portamento coinciding with faster tempos and shifts in cello technique. Silent porta- mento emerged as a subtle alternative to maintain expressive transitions. In the following section I will introduce two hypothesis which discuss the reasons behind the fastness of the metronome marks that Beethoven left behind and how unattainable they are for the performance of Beethoven\u2019s cello sonatas. II. BEETHOVEN\u2019S METRONOME The tempos in Beethoven\u2019s cello sonatas have sparked significant scholarly debate due to the contrast between Beethoven\u2019s metronome markings and practical performance speeds. Multiple theories attempt to explain this disparity, ranging from mechanical issues with Beethoven\u2019s metronome to the influence of piano design. Beethoven\u2019s metronome (one of the earliest designs by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel (1772\u20131838) who was a German inventor best known for designing one of the first practical metronomes, which standardised tempo indications for musi- cians), faced documented issues. Letters reveal Beethoven\u2019s complaints about the metronome\u2019s \u201cuneven pulse\u201d and fre- quent repairs, raising questions about its accuracy. [1] Mu- sicologists Lawrence Talbot and Sture Forsen hypothesised that mechanical degradation or misalignment in the pendu- lum could have caused Beethoven to set tempos that were unintentionally fast. [2][3] Additionally, researchers I\u00f1aki Ucar and Almudena Mart\u00edn-Castro propose that Beethoven may have misread the triangular measurement indicator of the metronome, potentially adding an unintentional 12 BPM to his markings. [4] The design of Beethoven\u2019s pianos significantly influenced tempo feasibility. Fortepianos in Beethoven\u2019s era had rapid tone decay due to leather damping mechanisms, which arXiv:2502.00030v1 [cs.SD] 23 Jan 2025"
