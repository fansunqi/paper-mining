  "title": "A Machine Learning Approach for Premature Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis According to Different E.pdf",
  "abstract": "Background Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) refers to the early onset of the disease, usually before the age of 55 for men and 65 for women. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) develops when coronary arteries, the major blood vessels supplying the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients, become clogged or diseased. This is often due to many risk factors, including lifestyle and cardiometabolic ones, but few studies were done on ethnicity as one of these risk factors, especially in PCAD. Method In this study, we tested the rank of ethnicity among the major risk factors of PCAD, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), visceral obesity presented as waist circumference (WC), diabetes mellitus (DM), high blood pressure (HBP), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and"
