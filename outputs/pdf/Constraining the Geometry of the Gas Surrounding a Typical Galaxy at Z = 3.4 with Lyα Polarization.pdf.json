  "abstract": "Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) emission is the intrinsically strongest tracer of recombining ionized hydrogen in young, star-forming galaxies, but its origin is still debated. Ly\u03b1 arises when emitted photons scatter in neutral hydrogen, with each scattering event changing their propagation direction and frequency. So far, observational efforts have mostly focused on the Ly\u03b1 surface brightness and spectral profile, which depend on the neutral hydrogen column density, geometry, kinematics, powering mechanism and on the region from which the photons are emitted. Although different processes produce similar spectra, they have different degrees of polarization, that we can use to discriminate between them and to put stringent constraints on the geometry of the galaxy and its circumgalactic medium (CGM) where Ly\u03b1 photons scatter, and on their emission mechanism. In this paper, we present the first deep spectropolarimetric observations of a typical clumpy star-forming galaxy at z \u223c3.4, strongly lensed by the cluster of galaxies Abell 2895, taken with the Polarimetric Multi Object Spectroscopy (PMOS) mode of the VLT/FORS2 instrument. We measure a Ly\u03b1 degree of polarization 1\u03c3 upper limit of 4.6%. We develop new Ly\u03b1 radiative transfer models assuming a biconical outflow geometry to reproduce the observations. We find that they can be explained by assuming the star-forming galaxy being embedded in a CGM with a biconical outflow geometry, with an opening angle of the wind \u03b8o,Wind \u223c30\u25e6for line-of-sight angles \u03b8LOS \u226420\u25e6, \u03b8o,Wind \u223c45\u25e6for \u03b8LOS \u226420\u25e6, \u03b8o,Wind \u223c60\u25e6for \u03b8LOS \u226420\u25e6, and \u03b8o,Wind \u223c75\u25e6for \u03b8LOS \u226440\u25e6, where \u03b8LOS = 0\u25e6means observing in the direction of the outflow. We notice that the constraints from polarization are complementary to those from the spectral line profile, and the joint analysis allows us to break the degeneracies that affect them individually. This study shows the potential of including measurements of the Ly\u03b1 degree of polarization to constrain the symmetry of the gas surrounding typical star-forming galaxies at the cosmic noon, and paves the way to deep spatially-resolved studies of this kind, that will allow us to disentangle between different mechanisms that can originate the Ly\u03b1 emission. Key words. galaxies: evolution - galaxies: high-redshift - polarization - radiative transfer 1. Introduction The evolution of galaxies is impacted by the gas reservoirs around them, known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM; Tum- linson et al. 2017). The CGM plays a central role in the exchange of gas, dust and metals between the galaxy and its surround- ings. It funnels toward galaxies the gas needed to form stars, it is the site where powerful galactic outflows end up and where gas recycling happens (Putman et al. 2012; Fox & Dav\u00e9 2017; P\u00e9roux & Howk 2020; Veilleux et al. 2020). The CGM presents a complex density and kinematic structure, that has been stud- ied in the last decades thanks to multi-wavelength observations and simulations. They revealed that the CGM is \u201cmultiphase\u201d, as it consists of different components ranging over wide intervals of density, temperature, and ionization state (e.g., P\u00e9roux et al. 2019; Wakker et al. 2012; Ford et al. 2013; Anderson et al. 2013; Suresh et al. 2017; Weng et al. 2022). This complexity makes the modeling of the geometry and kinematics of the CGM challeng- ing, in particular at high redshift, where it is usually modeled \u22c6e-mail: andrea.bolamperti@phd.unipd.it with simplified spherically or cylindrically symmetric static or expanding gas geometries (such as expanding ellipsoids) or with bipolar outflows (e.g., Eide et al. 2018), but the currently avail- able data do not allow us to distinguish them. The Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) line is one of the best observational sig- natures used in such studies, in particular at high-z, given its dependence on the structure, ionization, and kinematics of the H i gas where its photons propagate (Osterbrock 1962; Dijkstra et al. 2016; Gronke & Dijkstra 2016). It is the strongest tracer of recombining ionized hydrogen in young star-forming galax- ies (Partridge & Peebles 1967) and is ubiquitously detected at high-z (e.g., Zitrin et al. 2015; Vanzella et al. 2017; Caminha et al. 2023; Bunker et al. 2023; Nakane et al. 2024), but its in- terpretation is still debated. In fact, differently than other lines like the H\u03b1 whose photons propagate undisturbed to reach us, Ly\u03b1 has a resonant nature, and thus a Ly\u03b1 photon can undergo a great number of scatterings after its emission. The number of scatterings that it experiences before being able to leave its emis- sion site depends on the H i column density, geometry, and kine- matics (Adams 1972; Dijkstra 2014), on quantum mechanical Article number, page 1 of 15 arXiv:2502.01742v1 [astro-ph.GA] 3 Feb 2025"
