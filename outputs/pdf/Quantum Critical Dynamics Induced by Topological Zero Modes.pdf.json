  "abstract": "Our key finding is that the formation of hybridized pairs of topological domain wall zero modes leads to the anomalous logarithmic scaling of the ac conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) \u223clog \u03c9 at criticality, and \u03c3(\u03c9) \u223c\u03c92\u03b4 log2 \u03c9 away from it. Using the combination of real-space renormalization group analysis and qualitative hybridization arguments, we demonstrate that the form of the scaling of ac conductivity at criticality stems directly from the stretched-exponential (\u03c8(x) \u223ce\u2212s\u221ax) spatial decay of zero-mode wavefunctions at the critical point. Introduction.\u2014 Transport phenomena in disordered topological insulators exhibit behavior strikingly different from their trivial counterparts. For example, some subset of electronic states may become delocalized even in low- dimensional systems \u2014 a prominent example being the quantum Hall plateau transition [1\u20134] which, despite many years of research, is still poorly understood [5]. A simpler and more tractable model that displays similar behavior is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain [6] with chiral disorder, i.e. with disorder in hopping elements only. In this model, exactly one mode at zero energy becomes delocalized when the geometric averages of even and odd hopping elements are equal [7, 8]. Many aspects of quantum critical behavior in this model and the ones in the same universality class were exten- sively studied [9\u201314], and observed experimentally in dis- ordered atomic wires [15]. The renormalization group flow equations were solved analytically [16, 17] providing access to exact results such as the low-energy density of states and critical exponents. For the continuous 1D fermion model with random mass, characterized by the same fixed point, it has been shown that at criticality, charge carriers exhibit a logarithmically slow spreading of probability density [18, 19]. In this work, we obtain a remarkable manifestation of this behavior in the form of the logarithmic scaling of low-frequency ac conductivity \u03c3crit(\u03c9) \u223clog(\u2126/\u03c9), (1) where \u2126is a high-energy reference scale. This form of ac conductivity is highly atypical: as the frequency \u03c9 is decreased, we would expect the number of states par- ticipating in transport to decrease polynomially due to Pauli blocking. This would lead to insulating behavior as it occurs in the chain with purely on-site disorder (An- derson model) where \u03c3MB(\u03c9) \u223c\u03c92 log2 \u03c9 , according to the Mott-Berezinskiy law [20\u201322]. Instead, in the case of the SSH chain with chiral disorder and at criticality, the divergence of the density of the in-gap states induced by the fluctuations in the winding number introduced by impurities (Dyson singularity [1, 23]) compensates for the Figure 1. Hopping disorder in the SSH chain creates isolated rare regions characterized by extremely small effective tunnel- ing probability teff. Two zero modes appearing on both sides of the link teff hybridize away from zero energy with energy splitting \u03c9 \u223cteff \u223ce\u2212\u03b1\u221a d/\u03be, where \u03be encodes the typical size of individual zero modes and both \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b1 = 2 are possible in this model. The transition amplitude between these states in ac electric field is \u2223\u27e8\u03c8\u2212\u2223\u02c6x\u2223\u03c8+\u27e9\u2223\u223cd \u223clog\u03b1 \u03c9, implying an insulator for \u03b1 = 1 with ac conductivity following a modified Mott-Berezinskiy law (2), and, for \u03b1 = 2, a glassy metal char- acterized by activated dynamical scaling (1). Pauli blocking effects, and the dc conductivity diverges. This divergence is, however, only logarithmic in frequency, which indicates the tunneling regime of electronic prop- agation with the vanishing Drude weight, in contrast to the \u201cfree acceleration\u201d \u03c3(\u03c9) \u223c\u03c9\u22121 form [24] typical in conventional metals. Therefore, the appearance of (1) highlights a remarkable situation in which the topology almost exactly counteracts the localizing effects of disor- der giving rise to logarithmically slow \u201cglassy\u201d behavior of the ac conductivity. We note that using chiral disorder is crucial for this behavior as on-site impurities would lower the symmetry to the topologically trivial Anderson model without a divergent density of states. We also argue that away from the critical point, the form of the ac conductivity in the SSH chain with chiral disorder assumes the form \u03c3(\u03c9) \u223c\u03c92\u03b4 log2 \u03c9 , (2) with \u03b4 > 0 parameterizing the distance to the critical point [25]. Notably, 2\u03b4 = z\u22121, where z is the dynamical critical exponent. Thus, if \u03b4 approaches zero, z diverges, giving way to the activated behavior of Eq. (1).
