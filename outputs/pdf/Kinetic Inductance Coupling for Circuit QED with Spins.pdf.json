Wernsdorfer1, 2, \u2021 1PHI, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany 2IQMT, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany 3Photon Science Institute and School of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK 4Physics Institute 1, Stuttgart University, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany (Dated: February 12, 2025) In contrast to the commonly used qubit resonator transverse coupling via the \u03c3xy-degree of free- dom, longitudinal coupling through \u03c3z presents a tantalizing alternative: it does not hybridize the modes, eliminating Purcell decay, and it enables quantum-non-demolishing qubit readout inde- pendent of the qubit\u2212resonator frequency detuning. Here, we demonstrate longitudinal coupling between a {Cr7Ni} molecular spin qubit ensemble and the kinetic inductance of a granular aluminum superconducting microwave resonator. The inherent frequency-independence of this coupling allows for the utilization of a 7.8 GHz readout resonator to measure the full {Cr7Ni} magnetization curve spanning 0\u2013600 mT, corresponding to a spin frequency range of fspin = 0\u201315 GHz. For 2 GHz detun- ing from the readout resonator, we measure a 1/e spin relaxation time \u03c4 = 0.38 s, limited by phonon decay to the substrate. Based on these results, we propose a path towards longitudinal coupling of single spins to a superconducting fluxonium qubit. Spin systems are a promising platform for quantum information processing (QIP) due to their intrinsic iso- lation from the environment, which offers long coher- ence times [1\u20134]. However, this isolation also poses a significant challenge for spin manipulation and read- out. Superconducting microwave circuits provide a compelling solution within hybrid quantum architec- tures [5\u20137], combining their versatile design, quantum- non-demolishing (QND) readout, and efficient manipu- lation with the long coherence times of spin systems. Over the past decade, superconducting microwave res- onators have demonstrated strong coupling to spin en- sembles in various systems, including vacancy centers in diamond [8], donor atoms in crystalline substrates [9\u201311], and molecular magnets [12\u201315]. Despite these achieve- ments, inhomogeneous broadening limits ensembles co- herence, and QIP requires precise control over individual spins - a milestone recently achieved through the readout and manipulation of single electron spins [4, 16]. These advances rely on transverse coupling between spins and microwave resonators. For the simplest case of a two-level spin system, the resonator microwave field couples to the spin transverse component: H\u22a5 int = \u210fgx\u03c3x(a\u2020 + a), where gx is the coupling constant, a\u2020 and a are the resonator bosonic operators and \u03c3x is the spin Pauli matrix. While mode hybridization due to transverse coupling enables Purcell-effect spin read- out [4, 10\u201313, 16, 17], it is restricted to the cavity fre- quency and inherently non-QND [18, 19]. Longitudi- nal interaction provides a robust alternative because the spins couple directly to the resonator frequency via \u03c3z, i.e. H\u2225 int = \u210fgz\u03c3za\u2020a. The longitudinal coupling strength \u2217simon.guenzler@kit.edu \u2020 First two authors contributed equally. \u2021 wolfgang.wernsdorfer@kit.edu gz = \u03b4\u03c9/2 leads to a spin-flip induced frequency shift \u03b4\u03c9. Since H\u2225 int commutes with \u03c3z, it mitigates the limitations of transverse coupling, enabling frequency-independent and QND readout [20\u201323]. We argue that kinetic inductance presents a promising platform for longitudinal spin coupling, as it can be mod- ulated by magnetic fields or screening currents induced by nearby spins. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are a potential implementation, where the spin magnetic moment tunes the SQUID critical cur- rent [15, 24] and the corresponding kinetic inductance. However, SQUID-based designs face challenges, including limited spin-flux coupling in loop geometries \u2014 prevent- ing scalability toward single-spin readout [24] \u2014 and the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions, which lim- its the power dynamic range of microwave devices. Dis- ordered superconductors, such as NbN, NbTiN, InOx, and granular aluminum (grAl), provide a more versa- tile kinetic inductance for longitudinal coupling [25\u201332]. These materials offer several key advantages: (i) intrin- sic magnetic field susceptibility without requiring a loop geometry, (ii) resilience in Tesla magnetic fields, and (iii) adaptable nonlinearity, which can be significantly lower compared to JJ-based devices [33]. While kinetic induc- tance magnetometers (KIMs) [34\u201336] represent an im- portant step forward, the longitudinal coupling of spins to a microwave device has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we demonstrate longitudinal coupling be- tween a {Cr7Ni} molecular spin qubit ensemble and the kinetic inductance of a grAl microwave resonator. The spin ensemble polarization is encoded in the resonator frequency, independent of the spin-resonator detuning, enabling us to perform a full microwave readout of the magnetization curve. Moreover, we demonstrate time re- solved measurement of spin ensemble excitation and de- cay at GHz detuning from the readout. Finally, we pro- pose a scheme to achieve single spin longitudinal coupling arXiv:2502.07605v1 [quant-ph] 11 Feb 2025"
