  "title": "When 1+1 Does Not Equal 2 Synergy in Games.pdf",
  "abstract": "Although synergy is an important concept that is strongly in- grained in games, it has not been widely discussed by the games community. This is due to the vagueness of the concept and the fact that there is no clear agreement on what it means. To solve this, we present a strict definition of what is synergy. Then we propose a methodology to use this definition to analyze synergy in games. Applying this definition to various games (Chess, League of Legends, and Magic: The Gathering), we illustrate how it can be used to solve many of the practical problems related to synergy.

In fact, to the knowledge of the authors, there is not a single context in which synergy is used with a solid and widely agreed definition. Naturally, games are not free of this dilemma. Games have always been related to synergy by the various par- ties and stakeholders involved. There are several mentions and discussions of what synergy is, how to implement it, where it hap- pens in games, etc. Evidence of this can be found in many places, as further discussed in Section 2. They provide interesting insight on how gamers and game designers/developers view synergy. This discussion covers all types of games, from digital to analog, from strategy to action games. Synergy is an inseparable part of games, and anyone involved with games should give more attention to it. Gamers use it to en- hance their experience, to break games, and try their best to exploit it. However, their view is only one possible angle on the subject.

Having a more firm grip on what synergy is and how it manifests in games allows for better game design, and its detailed study would take steps towards opening paths to studies of the topic. For example: game balance is a property of games studied in depth [13]; a better understanding of synergy enables analysis of how synergy feeds into balance and improves this area. This work aims to help with this conundrum by providing a definition of synergy. We analyze existing discussions and condense the notion and understanding of what is synergy. We aim to allow for a more active, purposeful, and directed use of synergy in games. We provide here the first steps in the research of what synergy is. Continuing this work will then allow us to better understand the topic and its challenges. 2 Literature Review In a variety of informal discussions [3, 9, 17], where synergy is men- tioned, the discussion degrades to what is synergy rather than stay- ing within the original topic. Even when the subject is introduced with a clear meaning of synergy, it becomes a point of contention in the following discussion. However, more experienced industry experts provide a hard def- inition of synergy. Rosewater [10] defines synergy as \u201cconnecting things such that they produce something more potent in aggregate than in isolation\u201d. On the other hand, the Game Maker Toolkit video [14] uses synergy as \u201cwhen two or more elements combine to produce a more powerful effect than the sum of the individual elements\u201d. Those definitions are good for illustrating the general consensus of what synergy is. They serve the purpose of their con- text and discussion, but are not extensible to all applications, and thus can be improved to be more flexible in their application. The formal literature has different issues. Some authors, particu- larly shorter articles, do not define or provide any context for what they mean by synergy [4, 7]. This creates confusion when trying to understand motivation, goals, methodology, or even results. Traditional books usually define synergy when they use it [12]. However, to ensure that its meaning is clear, they go through lengthy explanations, comparisons, and correlations. This shows how complex this topic is, while also confirming how important it is to thoroughly discuss the meaning of synergy. Nevertheless, most of these discussions of synergy are not only about what synergy is. Most of the time, synergy is mentioned within a context of other features or related to other concepts, rather than individually. A common topic is how to achieve balanced synergy. Two red- dit discussions explicitly ask this question [5, 9]. The first counts on 20 replies with good value for the discussion (excluding short hate comments). The second counts with 15 responses with good contribution and citing 1 external source (a designer\u2019s blog post). arXiv:2502.10304v1 [cs.GT] 14 Feb 2025"
