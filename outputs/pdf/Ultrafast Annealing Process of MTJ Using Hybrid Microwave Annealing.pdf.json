  "abstract": "\u2014This paper discovers that the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure is successfully magnetized with hybrid microwave annealing, confirmed by the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and Coercivity (Hc) results. Hybrid microwave annealing can transform CoFeB into a single crystal and form the Fe-O bond at the interface between CoFeB and MgO without adding an extra magnet. The annealing time is significantly reduced from the original 120 minutes to just 1 minute, allowing for rapid low-temperature annealing of the MTJ structure. The TEM results are used to determine the change in the lattice structure of CoFeB from amorphous to a single crystal, and the EELS result indicates the diffusion distribution of atoms in the MTJ structure. This hybrid annealing process can save a significant amount of fabrication time and is an energy- efficient alternative to the current fabrication process of MRAM.

INTRODUCTION Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) is a key element of STT- MRAM [1]. Due to its nonvolatile, high-speed (~5ns), high- density (~F2), and high-retention (~10 years)characteristics, STT-MRAM can replace SRAM [2] and apply to in-memory computing for artificial intelligence [3]. The greatest challenge in designing MTJs for commercial applications is achieving high tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and coercivity (Hc) values, representing the success rate of reading data and stability. In MTJs based on CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB, the crystalline quality determines the TMR value. Commonly, the MgO deposited by RF sputtering exhibits firm texture (001) on the as-deposited amorphous CoFeB layer, which serves as a standard layer for annealing CoFeB. High-temperature annealing (>500 \u00b0C) can cause metal diffusion within the MTJ, leading to deterioration in the quality of CoFeB. Therefore, annealing temperatures are typically kept from 250 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C, with annealing times lasting from 1 to 2 hours. The magnet also helps align the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the interface of CoFeB and MgO during the thermal annealing [4].

In selecting annealing methods, apart from traditional furnace tube annealing, microwave and hybrid microwave annealing can also transform semiconductors into single crystals [5]. Moreover, the microwave is combined with alternating electric and magnetic fields, which control magnetism in ferromagnetic films [6-9] because electric fields redistribute the electron charge density, inducing the change in magnetism [10]. Another advantage of microwave annealing is the low-temperature process, which can reduce dopant diffusion and shorten annealing time. According to the above results, microwave annealing is a promising method for transforming the crystal structure and aligning the magnetism in the MTJ structure. However, one limitation is that the material must inherently possess the ability to absorb microwaves [11]. Hybrid microwave annealing is an improved method of microwave annealing that combines the advantages of traditional thermal annealing and microwave annealing. By introducing a susceptor (absorber) into the sample, materials that are not naturally good at absorbing microwaves can have their dielectric properties altered by the heating from the susceptor, making them more receptive to microwaves [12]. This study compared the effects of microwave annealing, hybrid microwave annealing, and traditional thermal annealing. TMR and Hc are used as indicators of the effectiveness of annealing. The experimental results demonstrate that hybrid microwave annealing can achieve TMR values similar to traditional thermal annealing while reducing the annealing time to one-tenth. A.Microwave annealing The alternating electric field in microwaves interacts with materials and can be divided into thermal and nonthermal effects. Thermal effect includes ohmic conductive loss and dielectric loss. The alternating electric field causes electrons and ions in the material to generate electrical currents, which collide with the material's lattice, resulting in energy transfer [13]. Nonthermal effects occur when microwaves directly interact with atomic bonding, causing energy transfer. This effect can increase the regrowth rate in the annealing process [14]. B.Hybrid microwave annealing Hybrid microwave annealing (HMA) is an improved version of microwave annealing. Compared to MWA, HMA incorporates a susceptor for heat transfer. When the susceptor"
