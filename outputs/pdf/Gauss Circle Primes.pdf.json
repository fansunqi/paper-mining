  "abstract": "Given a circle of radius r centered at the origin, the Gauss Circle Problem concerns counting the number of lattice points C(r) within this circle. It is known that as r grows large, the number of lattice points approaches \u03c0r2, that is, the area of the circle. The present research is to study how often C(r) will return a prime number of lattice points for r \u2264n. The Prime Number Theorem predicts that the number of primes less than or equal to n is asymptotic to n log n. We \ufb01nd that the number of Gauss Circle Primes for r \u2264n is also of order n log n for n \u22642 \u00d7 106. We include a heuristic argument that the Gauss Circle Primes can be approximated by n log n. 1 Gauss Circle Problem The Gauss Circle Problem concerns \ufb01nding the number of lattice points C(r) within a circle centered at the origin of radius r. As r increases, the number of lattice points C(r) approaches \u03c0r2, the area of the circle. See Figure 1 for the example when r = 5. Beginning with Gauss in 1834 [2, pages 271 and 277], researchers have focused on improving the error bounds between C(r) and the area \u03c0r2. Theorem 1.1 (Gauss 1834). The error bound between the number of lattice points C(r) within a circle of radius r centered at the origin and the area of the circle is given by |C(r) \u2212\u03c0r2| < 2 \u221a 2\u03c0r + 2\u03c0.
