  "abstract": "In this paper, we will develop a signi\ufb01cantly more general notion of classical Ramsey numbers (extending most other graph-theoretic general- izations) and make some preliminary characterizations of these new Ramsey numbers using simple algebraic tools. Throughout, we make a case arguing that, while our access to speci\ufb01c values of Ramsey numbers (or, in general, precise numerical solutions to Ramsey-theoretic problems) may be limited, the interplay between and overall structure of Ramseyian objects is likely tractable. To support the relevancy of this perspective, we conclude by demonstrating that the Green-Tao Theorem, the Twin Prime conjecture, Zhang\u2019s bounded prime gap theorem, and Polignac\u2019s conjecture can be viewed as statements about Ramsey numbers.

Usually, a generic Ramsey-theoretic problem seeks to determine the precise value at which this bifurcation occurs. There are many B.
