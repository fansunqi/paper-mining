  "abstract": "\u2014Reassembling multiple axially symmetric pots from fragmentary sherds is crucial for cultural heritage preservation, yet it poses significant challenges due to thin and sharp fracture surfaces that generate numerous false positive matches and hinder large-scale puzzle solving. Existing global approaches, which optimize all potential fragment pairs simultaneously or data- driven models, are prone to local minima and face scalability issues when multiple pots are intermixed. Motivated by Structure- from-Motion (SfM) for 3D reconstruction from multiple images, we propose an efficient reassembly method for axially symmetric pots based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time, called Structure-from-Sherds++ (SfS++). Our method extends beyond simple replication of incremental SfM and leverages multi- graph beam search to explore multiple registration paths. This allows us to effectively filter out indistinguishable false matches and simultaneously reconstruct multiple pots without requiring prior information such as base or the number of mixed objects. Our approach achieves 87% reassembly accuracy on a dataset of 142 real fragments from 10 different pots, outperforming other methods in handling complex fracture patterns with mixed datasets and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code and results can be found in our project page https://sj-yoo.info/sfs/.

INTRODUCTION R ESTORING ancient ceramic pots is essential for un- derstanding human history, including insights into past lifestyles [5], and economies [17]. However, they are often unearthed as fragmented pieces, or sherds, dispersed across Manuscript received xxx xx, 20xx. S.J. Yoo, Y. Aloimonos, and C.

An illustration of 10 real pots simultaneously reassembled from 142 unclustered sherds (3D point clouds) using the proposed SfS++ method. The dataset includes two pairs of identical but different broken potteries \u2014Pot (E, I) and Pot (C, J). SfS++ successfully reassembled the mixed 10 potteries with 87% accuracy, as displayed in this figure. excavation sites, intermingled with other artifacts, and degraded over time. Consequently, pottery restoration requires multiple complex processes to recover valuable historical records. Despite significant efforts by restoration experts\u2014who are equipped with knowledge of geometric features and historical context\u2014reconstructing even a single pot can take days of meticulous work. This challenge is compounded when multiple axially symmetric pots are intermixed. Pieces from different pots can be indistinguishable at first glance, making the trial- and-error approach time-consuming and risky, as repeated handling can cause undesired abrasions on the fracture surfaces. These difficulties underscore the importance of developing an efficient framework capable of virtually reassembling multiple pots at once [3, 42]. Over the past decades, research in pottery restoration has generally advanced along two primary paths: optimization- based global methods and data-driven approaches (see Table I). Optimization-based global methods [34, 25, 14] typically follow a three-stage process. First, extracting features from each pot sherd; second, identifying potential matches between each pair of sherds; and last, solving global combinatorial optimization to determine the most likely 3D pot configuration. This final step simultaneously evaluates all edges in the global sherds configuration graph, allowing the identification of true positive matches. Meanwhile, data-driven approaches [15, 22, 39] treat arXiv:2502.13986v1 [eess.IV] 19 Feb 2025"
