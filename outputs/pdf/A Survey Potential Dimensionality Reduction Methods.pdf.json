  "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental technique in machine learn- ing and data analysis, enabling e\ufb03cient representation and visualization of high-dimensional data. This paper explores \ufb01ve key methods: Prin- cipal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Sparse Kernel PCA, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uni- form Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). PCA provides a linear approach to capturing variance, whereas KPCA and Sparse KPCA extend this concept to non-linear structures using kernel functions. Mean- while, t-SNE and UMAP focus on preserving local relationships, making them e\ufb00ective for data visualization. Each method is examined in terms of its mathematical formulation, computational complexity, strengths, and limitations. The trade-o\ufb00s between global structure preservation, compu- tational e\ufb03ciency, and interpretability are discussed to guide practitioners in selecting the appropriate technique based on their application needs. Keywords: Dimensionality Reduction, Principal Component Analysis, Ker- nel PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, High-Dimensional Data, Data Visualization, Machine Learning. 1 Introduction Dimensionality reduction techniques play a crucial role in analyzing and visu- alizing high-dimensional data by transforming it into a lower-dimensional space while preserving its essential structure. These methods help mitigate the curse of dimensionality, reduce computational costs, and reveal underlying patterns that may not be apparent in the original feature space. This document provides an in-depth exploration of \ufb01ve key dimensional- ity reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Sparse Kernel PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. Each method is discussed in terms of its mathematical foundation, computational complexity, advantages, and limitations. PCA serves as a fundamental linear approach, while KPCA 1"
