We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. In addition to the physical insights, this work may serve as a launching off point for further work on this and related materials. Capturing CO2 from industrial flue streams and the atmosphere holds promise in mitigating climate change. Much academic, governmental, and industrial effort has gone into developing materials and systems that can cap- ture CO2 on a global scale. In most practical applica- tions, other molecular species, especially H2O, will be present in the gas streams from which CO2 will be cap- tured. A systematic understanding of water\u2019s effect on CO2 capture is elusive and difficult1. The nature of the interaction is variable, and depends on the type of CO2 adsorption (chemical vs. physical) and the material itself1. H2O can participate chemically, by forming bicar- bonate with an adsorbed CO2 molecule, form hydrogen bonds with carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate when adsorbed by amines, or compete physically for the same adsorption sites1. Metal-organic frameworks, consisting of metal nodes connected via organic linkers, are crystallographically well-defined structures that been thoroughly explored for their propensity as CO2 adsorbents2. One route to enforcing CO2 selectivity is the introduction of func- tional groups, like amines, into the frameworks. Amine- functionalized variants of Mg2(dobpdc) (Figure 1(a)) have been used as a high-performance sorbent for post- combustion and direct-air capture3\u20139. Generally speak- ing, these materials form ammonium carbamate chains down the crystallographic c-axis of the MOF, wherein the CO2 inserts itself between the metal node and coordinatively bound amine (Figure 1(b)), presenting with a cooperative adsorption mechanism7. Kundu, et al. showed that this behavior can be explained through a statistical mechanical lattice model in N-N\u2019- dimethylethylene diamine-functionalized Mg2(dobpdc) (mmen-Mg2(dobpdc))10. Later work identified the hys- a)jon.r.owens@ge.com teresis responsible for this behavior11. More recent work has extended this framework to account for dry12 and humid adsorption kinetics13, primarily using fits of ex- perimental data. In this work, we start by exploring the energetics of the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2O, with varying lev- els of both, including detailed studies of the atomic-level structures elucidated by ab initio calculations. We then study the physics of the co-adsorption by presenting a adapted model that accounts for the presence of H2O in the lattice model of Kundu, et al.10. Our model structure consists of 4 unit-cell repetitions of mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) in the c-direction. We compute the energetics of chain formation, starting from 1 CO2 adsorbed via the insertion mechanism, then 2, 3, and 4. For all of these cases, we consider 3 different H2O lev- els: 1, 2, and 3 H2O per diamine. We considered water- stabilized carbamic acid, but found it to be energetically unfavorable compared to ammonium carbamate. A key challenge in H2O adsorption is identifying the H2O binding locations. Compared to chemisorption, wherein the binding sites are well defined, the physisorp- tive binding of H2O has many more potential binding sites. To address this, we employed Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations14,15 to incrementally add water molecules, one at a time, to the system. Af- ter determining the optimal binding location for 1 water molecule, we translated it along the c-axis to ensure a consistent water environment across all CO2 binding sites in that lattice. This process was repeated to add between one, two, or three water molecules per CO2 binding site, with the system\u2019s charges reinitialized using the EQEQ method after each addition. Each water molecule was initialized at a low temperature to ensure it reached its energy minimum. Another potential complication is long-distance effects of H2O binding, as water forms extensive hydrogen bond arXiv:2502.00267v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 1 Feb 2025"
