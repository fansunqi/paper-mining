  "abstract": ". We answer an open problem of [ARR15] and [Rho14], extending their work to irreducible well\u2013generated complex re\ufb02ection groups W . We de\ufb01ne a combinatorial W -noncrossing parking space and an algebraic W -parking space for such W , and exhibit a (W \u00d7C)-equivariant isomorphism between the two. As a consequence of this isomorphism, we enumerate the W -noncrossing parking functions. Finally, we extend our results to the Fuss case. We prove the results for all such complex re\ufb02ection groups except G34, E7, and E8. 1. Introduction 1.1. Noncrossing Partitions. One of the most studied noncrossing objects in Coxeter\u2013Catalan com- binatorics are the noncrossing partitions. The noncrossing partitions in type A are partitions \u03c0 = {B1, . . . , Br} of the set [n] := {1, 2, . . ., n} such that there are no a, b, c, d \u2208[n], a < b < c < d where a, c \u2208Bi and b, d \u2208Bj for i \u0338= j. As shown in Figure 1, we can visualize this condition by drawing n nodes around a circle. We label the nodes in clockwise order by the elements of [n] with the condi- tion that the intersection of the convex hulls of distinct blocks is empty, hence the name noncrossing partitions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 1. A noncrossing partition in type A7 with \u03c0 = {{1, 5, 6}, {2, 3, 4}, {7, 8}}. We can extend this de\ufb01nition to \ufb01nite Coxeter groups. Let W be a \ufb01nite Coxeter group with re\ufb02ection representation V and \ufb01x a Coxeter element c \u2208W. The poset of all W-noncrossing partitions, NC(W, c), is de\ufb01ned as the interval [e, c]T in the absolute order (the Cayley graph of W generated by its re\ufb02ections T ). The W-noncrossing partitions are counted by the Coxeter-Catalan number Cat(W) := n Y i=1 h + di di , where d1 \u2264d2 \u2264\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264dn are the degrees of a set of algebraically independent homogeneous polynomials generating the algebra of invariants Sym(V \u2217)W and h = dn is the Coxeter number of W [Rei97, Bes03]. There is a Fuss generalization of these noncrossing partitions, called k-W-noncrossing partitions, given by multichains in NC(W, c) of length k [Arm09]. Noncrossing partitions and their Fuss generalizations can be further de\ufb01ned for irreducible well\u2013generated complex re\ufb02ection groups (see De\ufb01nitions 3.2, 3.5 and 2.11). 1"
