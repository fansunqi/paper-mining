  "abstract": "We present the discovery of the variable optical counterpart to PSR J2055+1545, a redback millisecond pulsar, and the first radial velocity curve of its companion star. The multi-band optical light curves of this system show a 0.4\u20130.6 mag amplitude modulation with a single peak per orbit and variable colours, suggesting that the companion is mildly irradiated by the pulsar wind. We find that the flux maximum is asymmetric and occurs at orbital phase \u22430.4, anticipating the superior conjunction of the companion (where the optical emission of irradiated redback companions is typically brightest). We ascribe this asymmetry, well fit with a hot spot in our light curve modelling, to irradiation from the intrabinary shock between pulsar and companion winds. The optical spectra obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias reveal a G-dwarf companion star with temperatures of 5749 \u00b1 34 K and 6106 \u00b1 35 K at its inferior and superior orbital conjunctions, respectively, and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 385 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121. Our best-fit model yields a neutron star mass of 1.7+0.4 \u22120.1 M\u2299and a companion mass of 0.29+0.07 \u22120.01 M\u2299. Based on the close similarity between the optical light curve of PSR J2055+1545 and those observed from PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1227\u22124853 during their rotation-powered states, we suggest this system may develop an accretion disc in the future and manifest as a transitional millisecond pulsar.

During this LMXB phase, the companion star transfers matter and angular momentum to the neutron star, spinning it up to \u223cms peri- ods (Radhakrishnan & Srinivasan 1982). Once the outward pressure exerted by the neutron star\u2019s magnetic field exceeds the inward ram pressure of the accreting material, the accretion disc is expelled, al- lowing the neutron star to become active as a rotation-powered radio MSP (Tauris et al. 2013). Spiders are a sub-class of MSPs found in compact binary sys- tems (\ud835\udc43orb \u22721 d), where the pulsar\u2019s high-energy particle wind can irradiate and progressively consume their companion stars, po- tentially fully devouring them in few cases (Fruchter et al. 1988; van den Heuvel & van Parad\u0133s 1988). This extreme interaction has earned these systems the nicknames black widows (BWs) and red- backs (RBs), characterized by companion masses \ud835\udc402 \u223c0.01 M\u2299 and \ud835\udc402 \u22430.3\u20130.7 M\u2299, respectively. Notably, three transitional MSPs within the RB category have been observed switching be- \u2605E-mail: marcoturchetta@ntnu.no tween the accretion-powered disc state and the radio pulsar state over timescales of a few weeks to months (Archibald et al. 2009; Pa- pitto et al. 2013; Bassa et al. 2014), positioning RBs as the missing link between the LMXB and MSP evolutionary phases. Furthermore, spider binaries in general are considered prime systems for hosting super-massive neutron stars, having undergone prolonged Gyr-long accretion episodes before activating as radio MSPs (Linares 2020). Spider MSPs often show large eclipses of their radio pulsations, caused by absorption from material expelled by the companion star (Polzin et al. 2020), making their detection in blind radio surveys par- ticularly challenging. Over the past 16 years, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT; Abdollahi et al. 2020) has played a crucial role in expanding the known spider population, with 65 confirmed systems to date (Nedreaas 2024). Since its launch, Fermi has enabled the discovery of numerous spider MSPs, not only as \ud835\udefe-ray emit- ters (Smith et al. 2023), but also through targeted radio searches of previously unassociated \ud835\udefe-ray sources (Thongmeearkom et al. 2024). Spider systems can also be identified through the variable optical emission of their companion stars (e.g. Salvetti et al. 2015; Linares et al. 2017; Au et al. 2023). The shape of their light curves is pri- marily determined by the degree of heating from the pulsar wind, which in turn depends on the system\u2019s orbital period, the compan- \u00a9 2024 The Authors arXiv:2502.13219v1 [astro-ph.HE] 18 Feb 2025"
