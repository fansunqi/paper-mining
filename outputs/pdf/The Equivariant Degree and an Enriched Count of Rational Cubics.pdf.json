  "abstract": ". We define the equivariant degree and local degree of a proper G-equivariant map between smooth G-manifolds when G is a compact Lie group and prove a local to global result. We show the local degree can be used to compute the equivariant Euler characteristic of a smooth, compact G-manifold and the Euler number of a relatively oriented G-equivariant vector bundle when G is finite. As an application, we give an equivariantly enriched count of rational plane cubics through a G-invariant set of 8 general points in CP2, valued in the representation ring and Burnside ring of a finite group. When Z/2 acts by pointwise complex conjugation this recovers a count of real rational cubics. Contents 1. Introduction 1 2. Background 6 3. The Equivariant Degree 9 4.

Introduction The topological degree of a continuous map f : X \u2192Y of connected, oriented manifolds of the same dimension n is the integer d such that the induced map on top homology, f\u2217: Hn(X) \u2192Hn(Y ), is given by f\u2217[X] = d[Y ] in Hn(Y ). The degree is denoted degtop(f), and if X and Y are n-spheres then f\u2217: Z \u2192Z is multiplication by d. The local degree of f at a point x in X in the preimage of a regular value y in Y , denoted degtop x f, is defined by first choosing an open set U \u2282X containing x and V \u2282Y containing y such that U \u2229f \u22121(y) = {x} and f(U) \u2282V . The local degree, degtop x f, is the degree of the induced map on n-spheres obtained by collapsing \u2202U and \u2202V : Sn \u2243U/(U \\ {x}) \u2192V/(V \\ {y}) \u2243Sn. One of the triumphs of classical degree theory is that the degree of f : X \u2192Y can be computed locally as a sum of local degrees.
