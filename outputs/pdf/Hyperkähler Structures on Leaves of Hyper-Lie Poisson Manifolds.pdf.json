  "title": "Hyperk\u00e4hler Structures on Leaves of Hyper-Lie Poisson Manifolds.pdf",
  "abstract": ". Due to its rich structure and close connection with gauge theory, hyperk\u00a8ahler manifolds have attracted increasing in- terest. Using in\ufb01nite dimensional hyperk\u00a8ahler reduction, Kron- heimer proved that certain adjoint orbits of complexi\ufb01ed semisim- ple Lie algebras admits hyperk\u00a8ahler structures. Later on, Xu ob- tained a proof for the existence of hyperk\u00a8ahler structures on adjoint orbits of sl(2, C) from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry. This paper aims to thoroughly investigate and elucidate the key di\ufb00er- ences as well as the underlying connections between two distinct construction methods. \u2022 Keywords: Hyperk\u00a8ahler manifold, Hyper-Lie Poisson structure, Adjoint orbit.
