  "abstract": "Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for vi- sualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse dif- fusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images. 1 Introduction Photoacoustic(PA) imaging[15] is a technique that visualizes the fine vascular structures within the body. In PA imaging, blood vessels absorb laser energy from short-pulsed near- infrared light and convert the energy into heat, leading to the emission of ultrasonic waves. The structures of objects can be reconstructed by sensing the emitted photoacoustic waves. This technology is non-destructive and non-invasive and is used to understand vascular struc- tures before surgery [3, 13, 32]. The issue with PA imaging is that single-shot images, which capture small local areas, are of low quality due to the limitations of the number of acoustic sensors. These images often contain significant noise, leading to a partial absence of foreground parts (such as blood vessels) (Figure 1, upper-right). Image-averaging techniques effectively reduce noise, which involves averaging multiple scans at the same position under the assumption that vessels are linearly correlated while noise is random [1, 4]. However, this approach requires increased acquisition time to cover a wide body area. Moreover, the data acquisition speed \u00a9 2024. The copyright of this document resides with its authors.
