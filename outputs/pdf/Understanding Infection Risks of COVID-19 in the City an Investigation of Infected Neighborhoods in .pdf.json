  "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, built environments in dense urban settings become major sources of infection. This study tests the difference of demographics and surrounding built environments across high-, medium- and low-infection neighborhoods, to inform the high-risk areas in the city. We found that high-infection neighborhoods own a higher ratio of aged population than other neighborhoods on average. However, it shows no statistical difference in terms of population density. Additionally, high-infection neighborhoods are closer to high-risk built environments than the others. In a walking distance, they also can access more of the high-risk built environments except for the wholesale markets and shopping malls. These findings advise policy-makers to deploy social distancing measures in precision, regulating the access of high-risk facilities to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Introduction Social distancing is widely adopted to slow down the spread of COVID-191,2. The epi-center, Wuhan, has successfully contained the infectious disease through effective measures, significantly reducing the daily confirmed cases from 1500-2000 at its peak to 10 cases or less a day 3. Cities that managed to contain COVID-19 would be keen to lift the measures as soon as possible, reviving the economic activities and social interactions back to the pre-quarantine level. Therefore, major cities of China have gradually eased the social distancing measures since late February 4. In a dense urban setting, if certain effective measures were lifted in areas that tend to spread the virus, there could be risks of a second major outbreak, compromising the hard-earned success. In this regard, understanding which types of built environments (BEs) in the city that could be high-risk areas of infection is of significant importance for the policy-makers to implement social distancing measures in precision. To understand the high-risk BE in the city, we should first identify the pathways of COVID-19 transmission. Recent studies confirmed COVID-19 can be transmitted in three ways. Firstly, patients could have acquired the virus through contaminated touchable surfaces5,6. Hospitals, consequently, have been one of the major sources of the virus transmission. Other high-risk areas might also include building elevators, metro stations and work offices. Another way of transmitting COVID-19 is through the aerosolized viral particles7. Infected individuals could spread the virus by sneezing, talking, coughing and vomiting. In this regard, besides the areas that are mentioned above, schools, shopping malls, local markets and wholesale markets could also be the high-risk areas8,9. Latest studies also found fecal-oral could be another transmission"
