  "abstract": "A subgraph H of an edge-colored graph G is rainbow if all the edges of H receive different colors. If G does not contain a rainbow subgraph isomorphic to H, we say that G is rainbow H-free. For connected graphs H1 and H2, if every rainbow H1-free edge-colored complete graph colored in sufficiently many colors is rainbow H2-free, we write H1 \u2264H2. The binary relation \u2264is reflexive and transitive, and hence it is a preorder. If H1 is a subgraph of H2, then trivially H1 \u2264H2 holds. On the other hand, there exists a pair (H1, H2) such that H1 is a proper supergraph of H2 and H1 \u2264H2 holds. Cui et al. [Discrete Math. 344 (2021) Article Number 112267] characterized these pairs. In this paper, we investigate the pairs (H1, H2) with H1 \u2264H2 when neither H1 nor H2 is a subgraph of the other. We prove that there are many such pairs and investigate their structure with respect to \u2264.

If G is H-free, we also say that H is forbidden in G. For an appropriate choice of H and a graph property P, we can observe a phenomenon that the class of H-free graphs is well-behaved with respect to P. The study of these combinations (H, P) is called forbidden subgraphs. It is one of the popular topics in graph theory. For the sake of the subsequent discussions, we restate this topic in a more formal manner. In order to avoid set-theoretic ambiguity, we only consider finite simple graphs and we take vertices from the set of natural numbers N. Define H0 by H0 = {H : H is a finite graph with V (H) \u2282N}. We sometimes consider the quotient set of H0 with respect to the equivalence relation based on the isomorphism. But as in standard textbooks of graph theory, we slightly abuse the notation and adopt the same symbol for both H0 and its quotient set. \u2217Department of Information Science, Nihon University, Sakurajosui 3\u201325\u201340, Setagaya-Ku Tokyo 156-8550, Japan. maezawa.mw@gmail.com, saitou.akira@nihon-u.ac.jp \u2020Research supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant number JP20H05795 and JP22K13956 \u2021Research supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant number JP20K11684 and JP24K06835 1 arXiv:2502.00667v1 [math.CO] 2 Feb 2025"
