Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entagled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled incommensurate magnetic phases in the phase diagram, which previously was predicted only for more complex type of interactions. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases. I. INTRODUCTION A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a novel phase in con- densed matter physics, characterized by the absence of long-range magnetic order due to strong quantum fluc- tuations, so electron spins do not form an ordered pat- tern but remain liquid-like even at zero temperature [1\u2013 5]. QSLs have been extensively studied due to their rich physics and unusual properties, including intrigu- ing topological characteristics [6, 7] and supporting frac- tional excitations [8, 9]. QSLs play an important role in understanding strongly correlated materials [10\u201312] and have the potential to serve as platforms for topological quantum computation in the future [13]. The Kitaev honeycomb model [13] is an exactly solv- able model whose ground state hosts both gapped and gapless Z2 quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The ex- act solution demonstrates that, in the Kitaev spin liq- uid (KSL), spins fractionalize into emergent quasipar- ticles\u2014Majorana fermions. One of the key advantages of the Kitaev model is its conceptual simplicity, which makes it a promising candidate for experimental realiza- tion. However, identifying material realizations of KSLs remains challenging due to the absence of a conventional order parameter [4, 14]. Recently, various iridate and ruthenate compounds have been proposed as potential platforms for realizing KSLs [15\u201321]. To explain Kitaev physics in real materials, numerous extended Kitaev models have been proposed and exten- sively studied. Historically, the first extension of the Ki- taev model was the inclusion of the isotropic nearest- neighbor (NN) Heisenberg interaction J, which arises from the direct overlap of d-orbitals (Kitaev-Heisenberg model) [15, 22\u201325]. Later, it was shown in [26] that an additional bond-dependent anisotropic spin-exchange in- teraction exists between NN sites, commonly referred to \u2217kapranov.av@phystech.edu as the \u0393 coupling (Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model). The \u0393 interaction is highly frustrated and is the second strongest interaction in Kitaev materials, leading to a complex interplay with Kitaev interactions [26\u201333]. A more realistic model must also account for the effects of trigonal splitting of the t2g orbitals, which induces an ad- ditional anisotropic coupling \u0393\u2032, which is not symmetry- allowed in the absence of the trigonal distortion [26]. Other perturbations present in real materials have also been investigated, including the second-neighbor Kitaev interaction K2 [34], and the second- and third-neighbor Heisenberg interactions J2, J3 [35, 36]. Another approach to realizing exotic phases of con- densed matter is through quantum simulations, where quantum-mechanical devices are used to mimic and in- vestigate quantum matter [37, 38]. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) can be realized using Rydberg atom quantum simulators [39] (toric code-type QSL) or quantum proces- sors [40] (Kitaev toric code). Despite significant progress in quantum computing and simulation, relatively high er- ror rates in two-qubit gates remain a challenge [41]. One of the major source of the gate error comes from the non- ideal interactions that induce parasitic coupling between NN and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) qubits. These in- teractions are described by an XX (or YY) Ising-like in- teraction between NN and NNN qubits [42, 43]. The DMRG is a powerful numerical method for com- puting properties of one-dimensional (1D) quantum sys- tems and is widely regarded as the most effective tech- nique for 1D systems [44, 45]. The DMRG algorithm optimizes a matrix product state (MPS)[46\u201348], a robust ansatz represented as a 1D tensor network. The compu- tational cost of DMRG for a system with N sites scales as O(ND3), where D is the bond dimension, which de- termines the size of the MPS and its capacity to capture quantum entanglement. The key reason for the success of DMRG is that the ground states of local Hamiltonians obey the area law [49\u201352]. This implies that the ground states of local Hamiltonians can be accurately repre- sented by MPS with a fixed bond dimension D, which arXiv:2502.08389v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 12 Feb 2025"
