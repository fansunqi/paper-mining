  "abstract": ". The use of monoids in the study of word languages recog- nized by \ufb01nite-state automata has been quite fruitful. In this work, we look at the same idea of \u201crecognizability by \ufb01nite monoids\u201d for other monoids. In particular, we attempt to characterize recognizable subsets of various additive and multiplicative monoids over integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers. While these recognizable sets satisfy prop- erties such as closure under Boolean operations and inverse morphisms, they do not enjoy many of the nice properties that recognizable word languages do. Keywords: Recognizability \u00b7 Additive monoids \u00b7 Multiplicative monoids \u00b7 Algebraic automata theory 1 Introduction Regular (or recognizable) subsets of the free monoid (i.e., the set of \ufb01nite words over a \ufb01nite alphabet) are one of the most well-studied classes of languages. Many seemingly unrelated notions \u2014 recognizability by \ufb01nite-state automata, recog- nizability by \ufb01nite monoids or congruences of \ufb01nite index, rationality, monadic- second order de\ufb01nability \u2014 all coincide for free monoids [4,8,9]. The algebraic notion of recognizability by morphisms into \ufb01nite monoids allows us to use tools from the structure theory of \ufb01nite monoids which has been particularly useful to characterize certain subclasses of the recognizable languages. For instance, we have Sch\u00fctzenberger\u2019s celebrated result that the star-free languages (languages described by rational expressions using only the union, concatenation, and com- plement operations) are exactly those recognized by aperiodic monoids (monoids which do not contain a group). Further, there are algebraic characterizations of piecewise and locally testable languages as well [4,8]. Related work. There has been a lot of research to de\ufb01ne algebraic recognizabil- ity for structures other than sets of \ufb01nite words like sets of trees [5], in\ufb01nite words [7], timed words [2, 6], and data words [1, 2]. The goal has been to show their equivalence with recognizability by automata models or de\ufb01nability by log- ics for these structures. However these \u201crecognizable sets\u201d are not recognized by \ufb01nite monoids but by other algebras. The survey [10] provides a great overview of algebraic recognizability of all the structures mentioned above."
