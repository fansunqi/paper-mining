  "title": "Superconductivity and Magnetic Ordering in Chalcogen-Intercalated Graphene Bilayers with Charge Comp.pdf",
  "abstract": "The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen p orbitals interact with the carbon \u03c0 orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature- flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as \u223c103 K that coexists with p- or f-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures. Superconductivity in carbon-based materials is a rapidly growing area of interest that presents both intriguing theoretical challenges and a potential for major technological advances. Having originated with the experimental discovery of superconducting states in bulk graphite intercalation compounds1\u20133, this field has recently come to incorporate observations of superconductivity in a variety of low-dimensional systems4\u20138 which are believed to be connected to anomalies in the electronic band structure, notably flat bands at magic twist angles in twisted bilayer graphene9. Theoretical interest, which also encompasses possible mechanisms for superconductivity in monolayer graphene10\u201313, is strongly motivated by the possibility of identifying physical mechanisms that may extend the superconducting phases to high temperatures such as those observed in the cuprate superconductors14,15, and focuses on the nature of possible unconventional superconducting states, whether pairing arises due to the electron-phonon or electron-electron interaction, and the possible connections between their mechanisms of origin and those responsible for the high-Tc superconductivity observed in the cuprates and iron pnictides16\u201318. In this work I introduce a class of two-dimensional materials in which two layers of graphene are combined with lattices of chalcogen and alkaline earth atoms in separate layers. While previous experimental work on intercalation of bilayer graphene has focused on metallic intercalants, which are highly ionised and dope the carbon \u03c0 bands to high densities19\u201323, in the systems I propose, the presence of a chalcogen lattice in addition to the metal ions gives rise to complex Fermi surfaces with electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, allowing a conducting state at net zero carrier density. The states near the Fermi level primarily move in the intercalation plane, being formed from the chalcogen p orbitals, and constitute relatively flat bands hosting van Hove singularities, with a strong enhancement of the density of states near the Fermi level leading to spontaneous electronic ordering. I find that the dominant instability is ferromagnetic, with critical temperatures of the order of \u223c103 K, and p- or f-wave spin triplet superconductivity being a subleading instability which fully coexists with ferromagnetism over a range of temperatures. The proposed crystal structure is show in Fig. 1a. Two layers of graphene (blue) are intercalated by a triangular lattice of chalcogen atoms (green) with a lattice spacing twice that of the graphene layers. A second triangular lattice, consisting of alkaline earth atoms (red) sits above the upper graphene layer. The superposition of the intercalant and adatom lattices with the honeycomb structure of graphene results in a superlattice with a unit cell containing one chalcogen atom, one alkali earth atom, and four atoms from each of the carbon planes. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds AC8XC8 with A = [Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba] and B = [O,C,Se,Te] was calculated using density functional theory (DFT) with the Quantum Espresso package24 with norm-conserving, scalar relativistic pseudopotentials25 and the DFT-D van der Waals correction26. An ionic relaxation calculation was performed to confirm the mechanical stability of the compounds at ambient pressure and determine the atomic positions. The 20 compounds share strong similarities in their electronic structure. DFT results for the density of states and the electronic dispersion along a path \u0393\u2013M\u2013K\u2032\u2013K\u2013\u0393 in the folded Brillouin zone are shown in Fig. 1b and 1c for CaC8OC8 and BeC8SeC8, with results for the remaining 18 compounds provided in the Supplementary Material. The bands closest to the Fermi level are primarily shaped by the interaction between the \u03c0 bands of the carbon layers and the intercalant p orbitals. Electrostatic interaction with the partially ionised chalcogen and alkali earth layers results in an energy splitting between the \u03c0 bands of the upper and lower carbon planes, as well as a shift of the intercalant states towards the Fermi level. As the separation between chalcogen atoms (twice the lattice constant of the carbon monolayers) is much larger than arXiv:2502.02931v2 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 6 Feb 2025"
