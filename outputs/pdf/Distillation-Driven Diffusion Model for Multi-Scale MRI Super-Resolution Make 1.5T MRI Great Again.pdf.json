  "abstract": "\u2014Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers critical insights into microstructural details, however, the spatial resolution of standard 1.5T imaging systems is often limited. In contrast, 7T MRI provides significantly enhanced spatial resolution, enabling finer visualization of anatomical structures. Though this, the high cost and limited availability of 7T MRI hinder its widespread use in clinical settings. To address this challenge, a novel Super- Resolution (SR) model is proposed to generate 7T-like MRI from standard 1.5T MRI scans. Our approach leverages a diffusion- based architecture, incorporating gradient nonlinearity correction and bias field correction data from 7T imaging as guidance. Moreover, to improve deployability, a progressive distillation strategy is introduced. Specifically, the student model refines the 7T SR task with steps, leveraging feature maps from the inference phase of the teacher model as guidance, aiming to allow the student model to achieve progressively 7T SR performance with a smaller, deployable model size. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline teacher model achieves state-of-the-art SR performance. The student model, while lightweight, sacrifices minimal performance. Furthermore, the student model is capable of accepting MRI inputs at varying resolutions without the need for retraining, significantly further enhancing deployment flexibility. The clinical relevance of our proposed method is validated using clinical data from Massachusetts General Hospital. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZWang78/SR.

INTRODUCTION M AGNETIC resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and versatile medical imaging technique that leverages strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency pulses, and sophisticated computational algorithms to produce detailed images of internal body structures [1].

One of the key strengths of MRI lies in its ability to generate high-resolution images of soft tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and other critical anatomical regions [3]. This capability has established MRI as indispensable in the detection and characterization of complex neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, brain tumours, and stroke [4]. For instance, in MS, MRI is used to visualize demyelinating lesions and monitor disease progression [5], while in Alzheimer\u2019s, advanced techniques such as volumetric analysis and functional MRI (fMRI) aid in detecting early cortical atrophy and disrupted brain activity [6]. Moreover, MRI\u2019s role in identifying ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes [7]. Over the last decade, significant technological advancements have transformed MRI, enhancing its diagnostic power through stronger magnetic fields and higher-resolution imaging capa- bilities [8]. From its early inception in the 1980s, when MRI systems operated at field strengths below 0.5T, the technology has progressed to the widespread clinical adoption of 1.5T systems [9], and more recently, to the cutting-edge 7T MRI [10]. These advancements reflect the remarkable strides in magnet design, gradient performance, and imaging sequences, which have collectively improved image quality, reduced scan times, and expanded the scope of clinical and research applications. The advent of ultra-high-field 7T MRI represents a quantum leap in imaging technology. With its substantially higher spatial resolution and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 7T MRI enables the visualization of minute anatomical structures and subtle pathological changes that may be overlooked with lower- field systems [11]. This capability is critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and prognostic assessments in a variety of neurological conditions [12]. For example, in epilepsy, 7T MRI has demonstrated an unparalleled ability to localize small epileptogenic lesions, facilitating precise surgical planning [13]. Similarly, in multiple sclerosis, it allows for the detection of cortical lesions that are less visible at 1.5T or 3T, providing deeper insights into disease progression and treatment response [14]. Despite these advantages, the clinical adoption of 7T MRI remains limited due to several challenges. The high cost of acquisition and installation, coupled with the need for specialized infrastructure such as radiofrequency shielding and cryogenic cooling systems, makes these systems prohibitively expensive for many institutions [15]. Moreover, operational expenses, including maintenance and the need for highly trained personnel, further restrict accessibility. As of 2022, fewer than arXiv:2501.18736v1 [eess.IV] 30 Jan 2025"
