  "title": "Zero Patterns in Multi-Way Binary Contingency Tables with Uniform Margins.pdf",
  "abstract": "We study the problem of transforming a multi-way contingency table into an equivalent table with uni- form margins and same dependence structure. This is an old question which relates to recent advances in copula modeling for discrete random vectors. In this work, we focus on multi-way binary tables and develop novel theory to show how the zero patterns a\ufb00ect the existence and uniqueness of the transfor- mation as well as its statistical interpretability in terms of dependence structure. The implementation of the theory relies on combinatorial and linear programming techniques. Several examples are described to illustrate the approach and point to interesting future research directions.

Introduction Largely employed across numerous domains such as healthcare, biology, and social sciences, contin- gency tables serve to display data in tabular format. Contingency tables have been extensively analyzed within the \ufb01eld of statistics, primarily with the objective of developing methods to understand the depen- dence between variables (see, for example, [1]). Recent work presented in [2] highlights fascinating con- nections between the analysis of two-way contingency tables and copulas. The essence of copula theory is centered on distinguishing between the in\ufb02uence of separate variables and their mutual dependency within the model. This separation facilitates the use of ad hoc dependence modeling techniques by trans- forming the initial joint probability distribution into one with uniform margins on [0, 1], known as the copula. When the marginal distributions are continuous, the copula associated with the original distri- bution is uniquely de\ufb01ned ([3]). For discrete random variables, it is not possible to transform marginal distributions into uniform distributions using the Probability Integral Transform (PIT). The PIT identi\ufb01es thecopulasolelywithinaspeci\ufb01csubdomain. Asaresult, numerouscopulamodelsalignwiththis speci\ufb01c subdomain. The adaptation of copula theory to utilize an analogous notion for establishing a margin-free model within a discrete framework has been investigated in [2, 4]. In that study and the referenced litera- ture, the authors explore the concept of transforming a given two-way contingency table into a new one that has uniform margins. This type of transformation clari\ufb01es the underlying relationships in the table, which could be obscured by notably uneven margins, as explained in the example below. Motivating example. For 2 \u00d7 2 tables, the process entails converting the original table into a new one in which each marginal probability equals 1/2, indicating a uniform distribution across the subdomain. In Table 1, we provide a classic instance from [5] that demonstrates smallpox cases documented at She\ufb03eld Hospital. The dataset categorizes patients based on their vaccination status (yes or no) and their recov- ery outcome (yes or no). The odds ratio, frequently used to evaluate associations in contingency table analysis, is notable with a value of 19.47. Despite this, the unevenness of the marginals could potentially Preprint submitted to arXiv February 17, 2025"
