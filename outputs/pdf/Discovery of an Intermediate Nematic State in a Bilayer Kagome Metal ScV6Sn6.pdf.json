Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee- Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA 5 Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, USA Nematicity, where rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice is spontaneously broken, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in correlated quantum matter, often intertwining with other orders to produce a richer spectrum of phases. Here we report a new phase transition in high-quality ScV6Sn6 bilayer kagome metal at a temperature \ud835\udc13\u2217, occurring seven Kelvins below the charge density wave (CDW) transition at \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc16, as indicated by thermodynamic, transport, and optical measurements. This emerging intermediate phase does not exhibit spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking, as evidenced by zero-field Sagnac interferometer experiments. However, it displays a strong, spontaneous (strain- and field-free) anisotropy in the kagome plane between \ud835\udc13\u2217 and \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc16, as revealed by transport and optical polarization rotation measurements. Additionally, a pronounced depolarization effect detected by the Sagnac interferometer further confirms its nematic nature. This intermediate nematic phase, alongside the recently discovered intra-unit cell nematic order at much lower temperatures, presents a diverse landscape of nematicities at multiple length and temperature scales, distinguishing it from those observed in kagome metals AV3Sb5. Our findings highlight ScV6Sn6 and the broader RM6X6 intermetallic family as fertile platforms for realizing symmetry-breaking phases driven by a unique interplay of competing CDW instabilities, kagome physics, and Van Hove singularities. Spontaneous symmetry breaking underlines a multitude of fundamental natural phenomena, from the mass acquisition of elementary particles 1 to various solid-state matters in nature 2.
