  "title": "Hidden Symmetries and the Generic Spectral Setting of Generalized Laplacians on Homogeneous Spaces.pdf",
  "abstract": ". The purpose of this work is to establish the spectral setting of some generalized Laplace operators associated to a generic G-invariant metric on a compact homogeneous space M = G/K. We show that this generic spectral con\ufb01guration depends on the G-isometries and on some certain hidden symmetries constructed in the adjacent structures of M and of these operators. Contents 1.

The spectral theory of operators such as the Laplacian, the Hodge-Laplacian and other similar related operators (for example, Hamiltonian operators and the Dirac operator) has many applications including classical and quantum physical systems, the di\ufb00usion of heat on a given surface, the propagation of a biological virus or a tumor or even other diseases, the evolution of neural nets, data processing, and so on [1, 10, 25, 36]. Specially in physics, the aforementioned operators are related to dynamics and physical phenomenons in many areas as quantum physics, New- tonian mechanics, general relativity, astronomy, wave mechanics, \ufb02uid mechanics, string theory, just to cite a few of them [14, 20, 22, 29].
