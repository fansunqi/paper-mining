  "abstract": ". A multispecies, collisionless plasma is modeled by the Vlasov-Poisson system. Assuming the plasma is neutral and the electric \ufb01eld decays with su\ufb03cient rapidity as t \u2192\u221e, we show that solutions can be constructed with arbitrarily fast, polynomial rates of decay, depending upon the properties of the limiting spatial average and its derivatives. In doing so, we establish, for the \ufb01rst time, a countably in\ufb01nite number of asymptotic pro\ufb01les for the charge density, electric \ufb01eld, and their derivatives, each of which is necessarily realized by a su\ufb03ciently smooth solution and exceeds the established dispersive decay rates. Finally, in each case we establish a linear L\u221escattering result for every particle distribution function, namely we show that they converge as t \u2192\u221ealong the transported spatial characteristics at increasingly faster rates. 1. Introduction We consider a plasma comprised of a large number of charged particles. If there are N \u2208N distinct species of particles within the plasma, then those of the \u03b1th species (for \u03b1 = 1, ..., N) have charge q\u03b1 \u2208R, mass m\u03b1 > 0, and are distributed in phase space at time t \u22650 according to the function f \u03b1(t, x, v) where x \u2208R3 represents particle position and v \u2208R3 particle velocity. Assuming that electrostatic forces dominate collisional e\ufb00ects, the time evolution of the plasma is described by the multispecies Vlasov-Poisson system (VP) \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u2202tf \u03b1 + v \u00b7 \u2207xf \u03b1 + q\u03b1 m\u03b1 E \u00b7 \u2207vf \u03b1 = 0, \u03b1 = 1, ..., N, \u03c1(t, x) = N X \u03b1=1 q\u03b1 Z R3 f \u03b1(t, x, v) dv E(t, x) = \u2207x(\u2206x)\u22121\u03c1(t, x) = 1 4\u03c0 Z R3 x \u2212y |x \u2212y|3 \u03c1(t, y) dy with prescribed initial conditions f \u03b1(0, x, v) = f \u03b1 0 (x, v) \u22650 for each \u03b1 = 1, ..., N. Here, E(t, x) represents the electric \ufb01eld induced by the charged particles, and \u03c1(t, x) is the associated density of charge within the plasma. A quantity that will play a signi\ufb01cant role throughout this paper is the total net charge (1) M := Z \u03c1(0, x) dx = N X \u03b1=1 ZZ q\u03b1f \u03b1 0 (x, v) dvdx which, in fact, is preserved at later times t > 0. It is well-known that given smooth initial data with either compact support in phase space or \ufb01nite moments, (VP) possesses a global-in-time smooth solution [26, 33, 35]. Though well-posedness has been intensely studied, the large time behavior of solutions to (VP) has only recently become better understood. Partial results for the Cauchy problem are known in some special cases, including small data [2, 13, 22, 23, 39], monocharged and spherically-symmetric data [21, 30], and lower-dimensional settings [3, 6, 16, 17, 18, 37]. Additionally, an understanding of the intermediate asymptotic behavior was obtained in [5], namely that there are solutions for which the L\u221enorms of the charge density and electric \ufb01eld can be made arbitrarily large at some later, \ufb01nite time regardless of their initial size. For general background concerning (VP) and associated kinetic equations, we refer the reader to [15, 34]. Date: February 6, 2025.
