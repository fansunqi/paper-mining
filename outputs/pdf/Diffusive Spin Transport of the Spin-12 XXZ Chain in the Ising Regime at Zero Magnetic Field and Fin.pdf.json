Rovisco Pais, P-1049-001 Lisboa, Portugal The studies of this paper on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at finite temperatures T > 0 have two complementary goals. The first is to identify the spin carriers of all its Sq > 0 energy eigenstates and to show that their spin elementary currents fully control the spin-transport quantities. Here Sq is the q-spin of the continuous SUq(2) symmetry of the model for anisotropy \u2206> 1. To achieve this goal, our studies rely on a suitable exact physical-spin representation valid in throughout the Hilbert space and associated with normal spin operators, rather than fractionalized particles such as spinons. Both the spin stiffness and the zero-field spin-diffusion constant are expressed in terms of thermal expectation values of the square of the elementary currents carried by the spin carriers. Our second goal is to confirm that the zero-field and finite-temperature spin transport is normal diffusive for \u2206> 1. We use two complementary methods that rely on an inequality for the T > 0 spin stiffness and the above thermal expectation values, respectively, to show that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish. Complementarily, for T > 0 and \u2206> 1, the spin-diffusion constant is found to be finite and enhanced upon lowering T, reaching its largest yet finite values at low temperatures. Evidence suggests that it diverges in the \u2206\u21921 limit for T > 0, consistent with T > 0 anomalous superdiffusive spin transport at \u2206= 1 and zero field. I. INTRODUCTION There has been significant recent interest in the spin transport properties of the one-dimensional (1D) spin- 1/2 XXZ chain in the limit of high temperature [1\u20137]. In this paper we consider that spin chain for anisotropy \u2206> 1. It is a correlated quantum system of great inter- est for different physical systems. For instance, this in- cludes systems of ultra-cold atoms where spin transport in a tunable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has been realized [8]. The theoretical complex Bethe strings of lengths two and three [9\u201312] in the spin-conducting phase of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for spin densities m = 2Sz/N \u2208[0, 1], cor- responding magnetic fields h \u2208[hc1, hc2], and anisotropy \u2206\u22482 have been observed in experimental studies of the dynamical properties of spin chains in quasi-1D materials [12, 13]. [The critical fields hc1 and hc2 are defined in Eq. (A13) of Appendix A.] Indeed, the low-temperature dy- namical properties of such materials is well described by this and related 1D integrable quantum systems [12\u201317]. Studies considering the limit of high temperature re- veal that at zero magnetic field the spin-1/2 XXZ chain has ideal ballistic spin transport for \u22121 < \u2206< 1, anoma- lous superdiffusive behavior for \u2206= 1, and normal dif- fusive spin transport for \u2206> 1 [1\u20137]. Finite contribu- tions to the spin-diffusion constant exist for anisotropy 0 < \u2206< 1 and T > 0 at zero field [18\u201320]. However, for 0 < \u2206< 1 the finite-temperature dominant spin trans- port is ballistic, the spin stiffness being finite [21]. Finite contributions to the spin-diffusion constant at finite tem- perature are also known to exist for anisotropy \u2206> 1 and zero magnetic field [20, 22]. The issue, however, is whether normal diffusive spin transport is dominant at finite temperature. This requires that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The absence of spin-flip odd charges besides the to- tal magnetization for \u2206> 1, zero field, and all finite temperatures T > 0 [20] proves that the Mazur lower bound [23] of the spin stiffness vanishes. Whether this, combined with arguments involving the use of the hydro- dynamic assumption (local equilibration) provides a rig- orous proof that the spin stiffness itself vanishes [19, 20] or merely a strong heuristic argument that it vanishes [24] remains under debate. Complementarily to the studies of Ref. 20, in this paper we handle the problem using completely different methods. In the last three to four decades, representa- tions in terms of spinons and similar quasi-particles such as psinons and antipsinons [25] have been widely used to successfully describe the static and dynamical properties of both spin-chain models and the physics of the mate- rials they represent. Hence such representations became the paradigm of the spin-chains physics. However, at zero field and arbitrary finite temperature, the contributions to spin transport involve a huge num- ber of energy eigenstates. Many of those are generated in the thermodynamic limit from ground states by an in- finite number of elementary microscopic processes. This renders the usual spinon and alike representations un- suitable to handle that very complex finite-temperature quantum problem. The results of this paper are for zero magnetic field, h = 0, unless specified. Alternatively, we use a suit- able exact physical-spin representation for the N phys- ical spins 1/2 of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for \u2206> 1 in its full Hilbert space. It is associated with normal spin operators, rather than fractionalized particles such as spinons, psinons, and antipsinons. It accounts for the q-spin continuous SUq(2) symmetry of that chain for arXiv:2502.11855v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 17 Feb 2025"
