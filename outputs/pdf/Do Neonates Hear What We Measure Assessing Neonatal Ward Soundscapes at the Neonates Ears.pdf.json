However, the lack of recognised international standards for mea- suring neonatal soundscapes has led to inconsistencies in instrumentation and microphone placement in existing literature, raising concerns about the relevance and effectiveness of these guidelines. This study addresses these gaps through long-term acoustic measurements in an operational NICU and a high-dependency ward. We investigate the influence of microphone positioning, bed placement, and ward layout on the assessment of NICU soundscapes. Beyond traditional A-weighted decibel metrics, this study evaluates C-weighted metrics for low-frequency noise, the occurrence of tonal sounds (e.g., alarms), and transient loud events known to disrupt neonates\u2019 sleep. Using linear mixed- effects models with aligned ranks transformation ANOVA (LME-ART-ANOVA), our results reveal significant differences in measured noise levels based on microphone placement, highlighting the importance of capturing sound as perceived directly at the neonate\u2019s ears. Additionally, bed position and ward layout significantly impact noise exposure, with a NICU bed position consistently exhibiting the highest sound levels across all (psycho)acoustic metrics. These findings support the adoption of binaural measurements along with the integration of additional (psycho)acoustic metrics, such as tonality and transient event occurrence rates, to reliably characterise the neonatal auditory experience. 1. Introduction 1.1. Background and Motivation The development of the auditory system begins very early in gestation. By 26 weeks of gestation, the human fetus begins to react to auditory stimuli. The auditory system then continues to develop to be fine-tuned to specific frequen- cies, to process acoustic stimuli into electric signals sent to the brainstem, to discern different speech phonemes and to facilitate learning and memory formation [1]. Following birth, neonates become increasingly attuned to their acous- tic surroundings. They can distinguish auditory cues from background noise and differentiate human speech from non- biological sounds as early as 28 weeks [2]. While sensory input due to the acoustic environment has an impact on the structure and function of the neural systems throughout life, its influence is most pronounced during infancy [3]. Hence, the auditory environment of a developing infant is extremely important to its development. In the uterus, the fetus receives auditory input via bone conduction and is surrounded by fluid and maternal tis- sues which attenuates high frequency sounds more so than low frequency sounds [4]. Preterm exit from the optimal environment of the womb means that preterm infants are \u2217Corresponding authors blam002@e.ntu.edu.sg (B. Lam); ang.shin.yuh@singhealth.com.sg (S.Y.

Prolonged exposure to high-frequency noise, especially in NICUs, can disrupt physiological and developmental processes. Studies have shown that such noise may lead to alterations in blood pres- sure, respiratory rates, and sleep cycles, all of which could be detrimental to neural growth and auditory development [4, 5, 6, 7]. In the NICU, loud transient sounds can induce immedi- ate physiological responses, including elevated heart rates, altered respiratory patterns, and disrupted sleep cycles [8, 9, 10]. These sudden noises are likely to trigger startle reflexes and stress-mediated defensive response, which may interfere with homeostatic regulation and delay neurological development [9, 11]. The absence of in utero maternal sounds increases the risk of long-term speech and language deficits in preterm neonates [1, 12]. Evidence suggests that interventions in- volving the introduction of spoken or recorded maternal sounds, can mitigate these effects, promoting improved au- ditory and visual orientation as well as enhanced cognitive and language outcomes later in life [13]. Consequently, opti- mizing the NICU soundscape by minimizing non-biological noise is essential, as it may enhance the efficacy of maternal voice interventions [2, 6]. However, a recent systematic review found that no NICU meets the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines of 45 dB(A), indicating a need for Lam et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 1 of 16 arXiv:2502.00565v1 [eess.AS] 1 Feb 2025"
