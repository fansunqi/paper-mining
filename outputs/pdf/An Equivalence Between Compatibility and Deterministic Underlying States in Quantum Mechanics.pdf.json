We \ufb01rst argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system\u2019s observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order. INTRODUCTION One of the most debated fundamental problems in modern physics is whether the quantum formalism\u2019s description of nature is complete, or if it could be supplemented with additional, or \u201chidden\u201d, variables [1\u20137]. While hidden-variable models have been con- structed which (partially or fully) reproduce the pre- dictions of quantum mechanics [5, 7\u20139], various impos- sibility theorems, notably Bell\u2019s [10, 11] and Kochen and Specker\u2019s [4], have shown that such attempts inevitably violate certain consistency conditions which we would arguably want from a successful description of reality [4, 10, 12, 13]. These theorems di\ufb00er in the conditions they impose, but a common feature is their indirect de- pendence on incompatible observables [4, 11, 14, 15]. In this paper, we explore the quantum state update rule (L\u00a8uders\u2019 rule [16]) to establish an equivalence be- tween the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and the existence of a speci\ufb01c type of determin- istic hidden-variable model for that scenario. The models we consider (called deterministic \u201cunderlying-state mod- els\u201d hereafter) are those in which underlying states deter- mine the values of quantum observables, while quantum states act as statistical mixtures of (i.e., probability mea- sures over) these \u201cbetter de\ufb01ned states\u201d [3]. These are the models typically considered in the contextuality and nonlocality literature [3, 4, 17\u201319]. In Ref. [20, 21], we argue that the result remains valid when the assumption of determinism is dropped, meaning it applies to all on- tological models [18], as well as all other hidden-variable models satisfying factorisability (i.e., the union of statis- tical independence and no superluminal interaction [22]), such as are typically used to test Bell nonlocality [11, 19]. Since we consider L\u00a8uders\u2019 rule, our analysis does not ap- ply \u2014 at least not straightforwardly \u2014 to hidden-variable reformulations of quantum mechanics that (directly [23]) exclude the collapse postulate, such as de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory. To begin with, we argue that, contrary to the typi- cal description of updated states as post-measurement states, updated states are theoretically constructed as pre-measurement states, with the quali\ufb01er post- measurement state regarded instead as a merely circum- stantial attribute. That is, instead of being updated by propositions in the simple past (\u201ca measurement of \u02c6A was made, and the value \u03b1 was obtained\u201d), we argue that quantum states are theoretically updated to ensure the validity of propositions in the \ufb01rst conditional (\u201cif a measurement is made of \u02c6A, the result will be found to be \u03b1\u201d) [24]. This approach aligns with multiple perspec- tives on quantum mechanics [25\u201329]. By this account, we argue L\u00a8uders\u2019 rule should translate into underlying- state models as conditional probability, because consid- erations about interactions with measuring apparatuses are automatically removed. Using Bayes\u2019 rule and Kol- mogorov\u2019s extension theorem [30], we then show that a set of quantum observables admits a state-updating underlying-state model (where states update via condi- tional probability) if and only if that set consists of pair- wise compatible observables. A single pair of incompat- ible observables is su\ufb03cient to rule out a scenario being representable by a state-updating hidden-variable model. Building on this result, we analyse ontological and meta- physical views typically associated with the absence of hidden variables in quantum mechanics. QUANTUM STATE UPDATE We \ufb01rst argue that updated states in quantum me- chanics are constructed as pre-measurement states, with"
