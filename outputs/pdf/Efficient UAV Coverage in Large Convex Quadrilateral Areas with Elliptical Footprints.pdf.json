  "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained signi\ufb01cant attention for improving wireless com- munication, especially in emergencies or as a complement to existing cellular infrastructure. This letter addresses the problem of ef\ufb01ciently covering a large convex quadrilateral using multiple UAVs, where each UAV generates elliptical coverage footprints based on its altitude and antenna tilt. The challenge is approached using circle-packing techniques within a unit square to arrange UAVs in an optimal con\ufb01guration. Subsequently, a homography transformation is applied to map the unit square onto the quadrilateral area, ensuring that the UAVs\u2019 elliptical footprints cover the entire region. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing insight into coverage density and optimal altitude con\ufb01gurations for different placement scenarios. The results highlight the scalability and potential for improving UAV-based communication systems, focusing on maximizing coverage ef\ufb01ciency in large areas with irregular shapes.

INTRODUCTION Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as airborne mobile terminals to ensure wireless connectivity during emergencies when cellular networks are unavailable or support terrestrial base stations to improve network performance [1]. Optimizing network coverage and throughput with a \ufb01xed number of UAVs presents a practical and intriguing challenge [2].
