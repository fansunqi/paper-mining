  "abstract": "We study the morphology of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows viewed off-axis using a simplified analytical model. We consider steep jets, which are expected to be the most common type. These jets, characterized by steep lateral gradients in energy and Lorentz factor, produce highly beamed emission. The observed signal is dominated by their minimum visible angle at any given time. Consequently, the afterglow morphology depends on when this angle begins to decrease, revealing the inner regions of the jet. Depending on whether this decrease occurs before, at, or after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta, three distinct classes of light curves emerge. In the first scenario, the de-beamed emission can produce a rapidly rising signal even prior to the reverse shock crossing. This is expected in GRBs with long duration, low energy, dense circumburst media, or combinations thereof. In some cases, the ejecta shell can be considered as effectively thick in the inner regions and effectively thin in the outer regions. For forward shocks, the temporal slopes in both regimes are identical, which makes it hard to detect the transition. Reverse shocks, however, have distinct temporal slopes, allowing potential detection of the transition in light curves if their emission surpasses that of the forward shock. The characteristic synchrotron frequency of de-beamed emission evolves independently of jet structure for forward shocks but depends on the lateral energy and Lorentz factor gradients for the reverse shock, with slower evolution for steep energy and shallow Lorentz factor gradients.

The electrons accelerated by these shocks produce the afterglow emission (e.g., Sari et al. 1998; Sari & Piran 1999; Kobayashi 2000; Zhang et al. 2006; Pe\u2019er & W\u0133ers 2006). These afterglows, observable from X- ray to radio wavelengths, evolve over timescales from seconds to years, providing probes of jet dynamics, energetics, and surrounding environments (Frail et al. 2001; Li et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2020). The evolution of the ejecta depends on whether the RS becomes relativistic before traversing the ejecta or remains sub-relativistic (Sari & Piran 1995). The former occurs in \u2018thick shells\u2019, while the latter takes place in \u2018thin shells\u2019 (Zhang et al. 2022). In thick shells, the RS becomes relativistic and significantly decelerates the ejecta. By the time the RS crosses the shell, most of the ejecta kinetic energy has been transferred to the shocked external medium (Sari 1997). In contrast, for thin shells, the RS remains sub-relativistic, resulting in \u2605ernazar.abdikamalov@nu.edu.kz \u2020 pazb@openu.ac.il negligible deceleration of the ejecta. However, as the RS crosses the shell, the FS sweeps up sufficient material to transfer most of the ejecta initial kinetic energy to the external medium (e.g., Kobayashi et al. 1999). Following shock crossing, the ejecta transitions into a decelerating self-similar expansion phase (e.g., Piran et al. 1993). For a jet with Lorentz factor \u0393, relativistic beaming confines emis- sion to a cone with a half-angle of \u0393\u22121 (e.g., Sari et al. 1999; Woods & Loeb 1999; Yamazaki et al. 2002). Observers can detect emis- sion only if they are within the beaming cone of the emitting region (Granot et al. 2002). Consequently, although GRBs are randomly oriented (e.g., Rhoads 1997), we are likely to observe jets that are on-axis or slightly off-axis (Nakar et al. 2002; Beniamini & Nakar 2019). As the jet decelerates, however, the beaming angle widens, revealing further regions on longer time scales (Granot et al. 2005; Granot 2005). Studying these events is important for understanding the full GRB population and jet structures (Huang et al. 2004; Lamb et al. 2021a; Duque et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024). For a recent review, see Salafia & Ghirlanda (2022). The detection of gravitational waves from the neutron star merger GW170817, along with the subsequent GRB, provides strong evi- dence for an off-axis viewing scenario (Abbott et al. 2017; Granot et al. 2017; Lazzati et al. 2017; Lamb & Kobayashi 2017; Gill & Granot 2018; Kathirgamaraju et al. 2018). Initially, off-axis viewing resulted in faint early emission due to relativistic beaming, but as \u00a9 2025 The Authors arXiv:2502.12757v1 [astro-ph.HE] 18 Feb 2025"
