  "abstract": ". Explicit representations of complex structures on closed manifolds are valuable, but relatively rare in the literature. Using isoparametric theory, we con- struct complex structures on isoparametric hypersurfaces with g = 4, m = 1 in the unit sphere, as well as on focal submanifolds M+ of OT-FKM type with g = 4, m = 2 and m = 4 in the de\ufb01nite case. Furthermore, we investigate the existence and non-existence of invariant (almost) complex structures on homogeneous isopara- metric hypersurfaces with g = 4, providing a complete classi\ufb01cation of those that admit such structures. Finally, we discuss the geometric properties of the complex structures arising from isoparametric theory. 1. Introduction Determining whether a given closed di\ufb00erentiable manifold admits a complex structure is a challenging problem, as the Cauchy-Riemann equation becomes over- determined in higher dimensions. Known examples of complex manifolds include complex submanifolds in complex projective spaces, Hopf manifolds, Calabi-Eckmann manifolds ([CE53]), the product of two odd-dimensional Brieskorn homotopy spheres ([BV68]), and twistor spaces of C. Taubes\u2019 self-dual 4-manifolds. Beyond these, few examples of complex manifolds are known. To study the existence of complex structures on a given manifold, one \ufb01rst intro- duces the concept of an almost complex structure and then explores its integrability. An almost complex structure J on a di\ufb00erentiable manifold M is an endomorphism of the tangent bundle, J : TM \u2192TM with J2 = \u2212Id. A manifold equipped with such a structure is called almost complex. It is clear that an almost complex manifold must be both even-dimensional and orientable. An orientable manifold M2n admits an almost complex structure if and only if the structure group of TM reduces to the unitary group U(n), making the existence of an almost complex structure a topological ques- tion. For example, Borel and Serre [BS53] showed that S2 and S6 are the only spheres admitting almost complex structures. The next question is whether an almost complex 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 32Q60, 53C15, 53C30.
