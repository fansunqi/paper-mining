  "abstract": "\u2014This paper proposes a joint design of probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) and precoding to enhance the sum- rate performance of multi-user visible light communications (VLC) broadcast channels subject to signal amplitude constraint. In the proposed design, the transmission probabilities of bipolar M-pulse amplitude modulation (M-PAM) symbols for each user and the transmit precoding matrix are jointly optimized to improve the sum-rate performance. The joint design problem is shown to be a complex multivariate non-convex problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function. To tackle the original non-convex optimization problem, the firefly algorithm (FA), a nature-inspired heuristic optimization approach, is employed to solve a local optima. The FA-based approach, however, suffers from high computational complexity. Thus, using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we propose a low-complexity design, which is solved using an alternating optimization approach. Additionally, considering the channel uncertainty, a robust design based on the concept of end-to-end learning with autoencoder (AE) is also presented. Simulation results reveal that the proposed joint design with PCS significantly improves the sum-rate performance compared to the conventional design with uniform signaling. For instance, the joint design achieves 17.5% and 19.2% higher sum-rate for 8-PAM and 16-PAM, respectively, at 60 dB peak amplitude-to-noise ratio. Some insights into the optimal symbol distributions of the two joint design approaches are also provided. Furthermore, our results show the advantage of the proposed robust design over the non-robust one under uncertain channel conditions.

INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, the exponential growth of mobile devices and data-intensive multimedia applications has tremen- dously burdened current radio-frequency (RF) wireless sys- tems. The immense demand for data traffic and high data- rate transmission has led to rapid progress in the research and development of new wireless technologies.

With several unique advantages, such as providing high-capacity data transmission with a huge unlicensed spectrum and im- munity to RF interference, VLC is expected to play a key role in the future ubiquitous networks [2]. While input signals in RF communications can be complex and are often subject to average power constraints, input signals in VLC systems must be real, non-negative, and are constrained by a peak power (i.e., amplitude constraint) to ensure the limited linear range of the LEDs and/or to comply with the eye-safety regulations [3]. According to [4] and [5], the capacity-achieving input distribution for a scalar Gaussian channel under an amplitude constraint is discrete with a finite number of symmetric mass points. In practical systems with a particular modulation scheme, this implies that the position and transmission probability of the symbols should be jointly optimized to approach the channel capacity. In literature, the optimizations of symbols\u2019 position and transmission probabil- ity are known as geometric constellation shaping (GCS) and probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS), respectively. Using GCS, the positions of the constellation symbols are arranged to approximate the capacity-achieving input distribution [6]\u2013 [8]. However, GCS is typically impractical because finding the optimal locations of constellation points for arbitrary channel conditions is complex. Furthermore, the irregular arrangement of GCS constellation symbols increases transceiver complexity significantly and makes it difficult to maintain Gray mapping. Instead of arranging the constellation symbol\u2019s position, PCS shapes the probability of occurrence of constellation symbols, i.e., constellation symbols are chosen with a nonuniform probability distribution [9]\u2013[11]. A probabilistically shaped constellation can be generated by a constant composition distribution matcher (CCDM) [12], which maps uniform in- formation bits into symbols with the desired distribution. In contrast to GCS, constellation symbols in PCS are evenly spaced, enabling easy implementation of Gray mapping and not requiring upgrading or modifying the transceiver. Due to its low complexity and flexibility, PCS has been widely studied in optical fiber [13]\u2013[15] and optical wireless communications [16]\u2013[19]. For optical fiber communication systems, the authors in [13] derived the optimal parameters of PCS and forward error correction (FEC) that maximize the information rate.
