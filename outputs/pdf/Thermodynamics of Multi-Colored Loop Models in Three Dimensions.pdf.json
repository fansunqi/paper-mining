  "abstract": "We show that the nature of the transition is intimately related to the nature of the loops. The symmetric loops undergo a first order phase transition, while the non-symmetric loops show a second-order transi- tion. The critical exponents for the non-symmetric loops are calculated. In three dimensions, the regular loop model with no interactions is dual to the XY model. We argue that, due to interactions among the colors, the specific heat exponent is found to be different from that of the regular loop model. The continuous nature of the transition is altered to a discontinuous one due to the strong inter-color interactions. I.
