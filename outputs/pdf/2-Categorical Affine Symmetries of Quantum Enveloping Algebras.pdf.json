    "2-representations of U+(s\u0303ln+1) on U+(sln+1)"
  ],
  "title": "2-Categorical Affine Symmetries of Quantum Enveloping Algebras.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We produce 2-representations of the positive part of a\ufb03ne quantum enveloping algebras on their \ufb01nite-dimensional counterparts in type An. These 2-representations naturally extend the right- multiplication 2-representation of U+ q (sln+1) on itself and are closely related to evaluation morphisms of quantum groups. We expect that our 2-representation exists in all simple types and show that the corre- sponding 1-representation exists in type D4. Contents 1. Introduction 1 1.1. A\ufb03ne Quantum Groups 2 1.2.

These representations extend the natural right-multiplication 2-representation of U + q (sln+1) on itself and are given by formulas based on the quantum evaluation homomorphisms Uq(\u02dcsln+1) \u0589 Uq(gln+1). We expect that our 2-representation can be de\ufb01ned outside of type An, which was a limitation of the quantum evaluation homomorphisms. To construct these 2-representations, we use the monoidal categori\ufb01cations of quantum groups via KLR algebras introduced in 1"
