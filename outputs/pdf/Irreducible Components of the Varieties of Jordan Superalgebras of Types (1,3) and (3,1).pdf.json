  "abstract": ". We describe the variety of Jordan superalgebras of dimension 4 whose even part is a Jordan algebra of dimension 1 or 3. We prove that the variety is the union of Zariski closures of the orbits of 11 and 21 rigid superalgebras, respectively. In both cases, the irreducible components of the varieties are described. Furthermore, we exhibit a four-dimensional solvable rigid Jordan superalgebra, showing that an analogue to the Vergne conjecture for Jordan superalgebras does not hold. 1. Introduction The algebraic classification of different types of low-dimensional algebras repre- sents a classical problem of significant interest in algebraic studies. In recent years, there has been a growing significance in their geometric classification. Several noteworthy results have been achieved regarding the degenerations be- tween low-dimensional algebras in a variety defined by polynomial identities. A crucial focus in this line of inquiry is to find the rigid algebras of the variety. These algebras hold significant interest since the closures of their orbits, under the action of the general linear group, constitute irreducible components within the considered variety, with respect to the Zariski topology. Numerous works have delved into the challenging task of identifying the irre- ducible components of low-dimensional algebraic varieties. Namely, the works of P. Gabriel [11] and G. Mazzola [21] have describe all rigid algebras for the variety of unitary associative algebras of dimensions four and five, respectively. Moreover, the geometric classification of Lie algebras, is known for dimension up to six; see, for example, [8] and [19]. As for the variety of Jordan algebras, references began in 2005 with [14], by I. Kashuba and I. Shestakov, related to three-dimensional Jordan algebras. It was followed by [15] and [16], by I. Kashuba and M. E. Martin, who studied the geometric classification of four-dimensional Jordan algebras over an algebraically closed field and three-dimensional real Jordan algebras, respectively. The authors showed that any irreducible component in these varieties is determined by a rigid algebra. In [4], it was established that the subvariety of nilpotent Jordan algebras is irreducible for dimensions up to three, and it admits two algebraic components in dimension four. In 2018, in [17], was determined that the subvariety of nilpotent 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 17C55, 17C70, 14J10. Key words and phrases.
