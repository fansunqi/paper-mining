  "abstract": ". In this paper, we give a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for a subgroup to be a perfect code for \ufb01nite groups. As an application, we determine all subgroup perfect codes of extraspecial 2-groups and \ufb01nite groups whose Sylow 2-subgroup is extraspecial. Keywords: Cayley graph, subgroup perfect codes, extraspecial 2-group. Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation: 05C25, 05C69, 94B25 1 Introduction All groups considered are \ufb01nite, and all graphs considered are \ufb01nite, undirected and simple. Let G be a group and S be an inverse-closed subset of G \\ {1}. The Cayley graph Cay (G, S) on G with connection set S is the graph with vertex set G such that x, y \u2208G are adjacent if and only if yx\u22121 \u2208S. A subset C of the vertex set of a graph \u0393 is called a perfect code [8] in \u0393 if C is an independent set and every vertex of \u0393 is at distance no more than 1 to exactly one vertex of C, in particular, a perfect code is also called an independent perfect dominating set [11] or e\ufb03cient dominating set [3]. A subgroup H of a group G is called a perfect code of G if there exists a Cayley graph Cay (G, S) of G admiting H as a perfect code. In the research of perfect codes in graphs, especially perfect codes in Cayley graphs have received special attention [1\u20136,9\u201316]. For a \ufb01nite group G, the question whether a subgroup of G is a perfect code of G has attracted a lot of attention. In [6], Huang, Xia and Zhou introduced the concept of subgroup perfect codes in Cayley graphs and gave a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for a normal subgroup of G to be a perfect code and determined all subgroup perfect codes of cyclic groups and dihedral groups. In [12], Ma, Walls, Wang and Zhou proposed that a group is called code-perfect if every subgroup of G is a perfect code, and showed that a group is code-perfect if and only if \u2217Corresponding author at: College of General Education, Guangxi Vocational University of Agriculture.
