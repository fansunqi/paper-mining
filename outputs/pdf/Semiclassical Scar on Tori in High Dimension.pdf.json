  "abstract": "We show that the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint elliptic h\u2212di\ufb00erential operator Ph(t) exhibits semi- classical scar phenomena on the d\u2212dimensional torus, under the \u03c3-Bruno-R\u00a8ussmann condition, instead of the Diophantine one. Its equivalence is described as: for almost all perturbed Hamiltonian\u2019s KAM Lagrangian tori \u039b\u03c9, there exists a semiclassical measure with positive mass on \u039b\u03c9. The premise is that we can obatain a family of quasimodes for the h\u2212di\ufb00erential operator Ph(t) in the semiclassical limit as h \u21920, under the \u03c3-Bruno-R\u00a8ussmann condition. Keywords: Eigenvalue, Quasimode, semiclassical scarring, positive mass, energy window 1. Introduction Semiclassical scars are an intriguing phenomenon in quantum systems, where, despite the system\u2019s chaotic behavior at the classical level, the quantum wave function localizes near certain classical periodic orbits. This phenomenon, known as scars, is primarily observed in the semiclassical limit, where the system\u2019s energy is low (i.e., the Planck constant h is small) or the wavelength is long. While the classical system is chaotic, the quantum wave function may still localize near these periodic orbits, leaving behind a scar. This highlights the transition between quantum and classical descriptions, particularly in the low-energy regime, where classical orbits signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uence the quantum state. Although the classical chaos, semiclassical methods provide insights into this phenomenon by linking quantum states to classical dynamics, such as WKB theory together with Gutzwiller\u2019s trace formula. The understanding of semiclassical scars helps to explore the quantum-classical relationship, o\ufb00ering deeper insights into quantum chaos, dynamics, and information. Moreover, this phenomenon has potential ap- plications in quantum computing, particularly in the control and stabilization of quantum states. In the physics literature, if an eigenfunction exhibits slight enhancement near unstable periodic orbits, this phenomenon is commonly referred to as a scar by physicists (Hel\ufb00er [13]). Accordingly, in the mathematics literature, a sequence of eigenfunctions is said to be strongly scarred if the corresponding semiclassical measure \u00b5 is supported on some periodic trajectory (Anantharaman [1]). 1E-mail address : yuanhh128@nenu.edu.cn 2E-mail address : liyong@jlu.edu.cn 3Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation (MSC 2020): 81Q20, 37J40, 70H08.
