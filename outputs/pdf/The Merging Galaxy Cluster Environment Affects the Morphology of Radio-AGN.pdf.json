  "title": "The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN.pdf",
  "abstract": "It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z<0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.

INTRODUCTION It is now well established that dense environments such as galaxy clusters affect the properties and evolu- tion of the galaxies within them (see references detailed Corresponding author: Emily Moravec emoravec@nrao.edu \u2217co-first author Mary Rickel was a summer student at Green Bank Observatory \u2020 co-first author below). There are a variety of interactions between the galaxies, the intra-cluster medium (ICM; a diffuse, hot, ionized plasma that is gravitationally bound to the cluster), and the cluster potential that are possible and prevalent in clusters that affect properties and evolution of galaxies. Some examples of the possible interactions are galaxy-galaxy harassment (repeated close encoun- ters with neighbors; Moore et al. 1996, 1999), galaxy- cluster potential tidal effects (Fujita 1998; Natarajan et al. 1998), and galaxy interactions with the ICM, such as ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972) arXiv:2502.04198v1 [astro-ph.GA] 6 Feb 2025"
