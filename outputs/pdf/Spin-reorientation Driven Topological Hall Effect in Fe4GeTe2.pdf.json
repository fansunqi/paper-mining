  "abstract": "Compet- ing magnetic interactions and anisotropies can give rise to nontrivial spin textures in these materials, resulting in novel topological features. Fe4GeTe2 (F4GT) is a nearly room-temperature vdW ferromagnet, well known for hosting a spin-reorientation transition (SRT) arising from the interplay of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and shape anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the angle-dependent magneto-transport properties of F4GT single crystals. We report a large topological Hall effect (THE) in a multi-layer F4GT originating from the SRT-driven non-coplanar spin textures. The THE appears at the in-plane orientation of the external magnetic field and persists over a wide range of temperatures around SRT. Additionally, we find a thickness-sensitive THE signal for the c axis orientation of the magnetic field at a low-temperature regime which is associated with a reentrant Lifshitz transition. Introduction.\u2014 In the last few decades, intensive research focusing on the topological aspect of condensed matter physics has led to many remarkable and exciting discoveries. Novel topological materials, such as Weyl and Dirac semimet- als, topological insulators, and topological superconductors, have emerged as platforms for exploring unique and exotic physical phenomena. Since the discovery of the skyrmion lat- tice in the chiral ferromagnet MnSi [1], observation of numer- ous other topologically non-trivial chiral spin textures, such as antiskyrmions [2], skyrmionium [3], (anti)merons [4, 5], bimerons [6], etc. have been reported in various other sys- tems. A finite scalar spin chirality typically characterizes these topological vortices and other non-coplanar spin tex- tures. As electrons hop between localized spin sites with scalar spin chirality, they acquire a Berry phase factor, re- sulting in a fictitious magnetic field. The emergent gauge field leads to intriguing magneto-transport phenomena, such as the topological Hall effect (THE). The Berry phase fac- tor is also responsible for the well-known anomalous Hall ef- fect (AHE) in ferromagnets. However, unlike the AHE, which arises from an electron acquiring an anomalous velocity due to a finite Berry phase in k-space, the THE originates from Berry phase accumulation in real space caused by chiral spin textures. THE originating from topological spin textures has mostly been observed in non-centrosymmetric systems like MnSi [7], MnGe [8], Mn5Si3 [9], FeGe [10], etc, as a bro- ken inversion symmetry favors Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya inter- action (DMI). There also exists experimental observation of THE in a few centrosymmetric systems such as MnNiGa [11], NdMn2Ge2 [12], Mn3Sn [13], Gd2PdSi3 [14], etc., attributed to magnetic frustration induced local breaking of inversion symmetry. Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have garnered significant attention in the field of low-dimensional magnetism in re- cent years, owing to their atomically smooth surface which can be conveniently integrated into novel heterostructures. FenGeTe2 (n= 3,4,5) is a family of vdW ferromagnets that is well-known for their high Curie temperature, which extends up to 310 K in Fe5GeTe2 [15]. Competing magnetic interac- tion and anisotropies often lead to exotic magnetic phases and topologically non-trivial spin formations in these systems. Re- cent observations of skyrmions and merons in centrosymmet- ric Fe3GeTe2 [16, 17], Fe5GeTe2 [18], Fe5\u2212xGeTe2 [4, 19] and Fe3GaTe2 [20\u201323] holds promise for next-generation energy-efficient and high-performance technologies. On the other hand, Fe4GeTe2 (F4GT) is a near room-temperature vdW ferromagnet of the same family with a well-known spin reorientation transition (SRT) at the intermediate temperature which arises from the competing magnetic anisotropies [24, 25]. Despite belonging to the centrosymmetric R3m space group, these competing interactions can potentially give rise to distinctive topological properties. In this work, we study the angle-dependent magneto- transport properties of F4GT crystal to characterize its topo- logical features. We identify a large THE near the SRT tem- perature for the ab plane orientation of the applied magnetic field. The THE signature persists down to the lowest mea- sured temperature of 2 K with diminishing strength. For c axis orientation of the DC field, we observe a thickness-dependent THE signature at low temperatures associated with a reentrant Lifshitz transition. Experimental methods.\u2014 F4GT single crystals are grown using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method with io- dine (I2) as a transport agent. The typical crystal dimension is approximately 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.1 mm3. Energy dispersive X- ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement is carried out on freshly cleaved crystal surfaces to confirm the atomic composition of the F4GT crystals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement is performed using a PANalytical X\u2019Pert diffractometer to study the crystallinity of the bulk single crystals. The static mag- netic properties of the bulk samples are studied with a vibrat- ing sample magnetometer (VSM) from Quantum Design Ltd. For the magneto-transport measurements, we use a variable temperature insert (VTI) along with a 12 T superconducting magnet provided by Cryogenics Ltd. Results and discussion.\u2014 F4GT crystallizes into cen- trosymmetric R\u00af3m space group with rhombohedral lattice symmetry where Fe4Ge slabs remain sandwiched between Te layers [Fig. 1(a)].
