  "abstract": ". We construct the first examples of rationally convex surfaces in the complex plane with hyperbolic complex tangencies. In fact, we give two very different types of rationally convex surfaces: those that admit analytic fillings by handle-bodies, and those that do not have any compact Riemann surfaces attached at all. The fillable examples all live in the round sphere and are unknotted, while the non-fillable examples can moreover be produced in several different smooth isotopy classes. Contents 1.

In particular, their study has motivated a lot of research in low dimensional topology. A key question is whether there is a filling by holomorphic discs. From the point of view of complex analysis, these questions hold interest as part of the theory of polynomial hulls of submanifolds of Cn. From the point of view of complex analysis, a key fact is that a Lagrangian torus is rationally convex. Conversely, if a torus is isotropic for some global K\u00a8ahler form, then it is rationally convex. Both results are contained in Duval\u2013Sibony\u2019s seminal work [DS95]. Recall that Lagrangian for some global K\u00a8ahler form implies totally real, but that the converse does not necessarily hold. Suppose now that \u03a32 \u2286C2 is an embedded surface. Consider a vector-field V tangent to \u03a3 with 2 \u22122g algebraic number of zeroes contained in the totally-real locus of \u03a3. If we push off \u03a3 along JV to \u03a3JV , we thus get a contribution of 2g \u22122 from the zeros of V to the algebraic intersection number \u03a3 \u2022 \u03a3JV = 0. If JT\u03a3 \u2229T\u03a3 is generic, it follows that there must be additional intersections that give rise to an algebraic count 2 \u22122g, which all must come from the presence of complex tangencies; the hyperbolic (resp. elliptic) complex tangents are those generic and isolated complex tangencies that contribute to \u22121 (resp. +1) to this intersection number. If there are elliptic complex tangents, then there must exist a local holomorphic fillings, which precludes rational convexity; see [BK91]. On the other hand, if \u03a32 has only hyperbolic complex tangents, which thus necessarily means that 2g \u22122 \u22650, then the surface could be rationally convex. In Subsection 4.1 we show that such a surface can be assumed to be Lagrangian for a K\u00a8ahler form that becomes degenerate precisely at the hyperbolic complex tangencies (no such K\u00a8ahler form can The first author is supported by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the grants KAW 2021.0191 and KAW 2023.0294. 1 arXiv:2502.03357v1 [math.SG] 5 Feb 2025"
