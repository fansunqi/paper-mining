  "title": "Federated Learning-Driven Cybersecurity Framework for IoT Networks with Privacy-Preserving and Real-.pdf",
  "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has revolutionized various sectors but has also introduced critical vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Conventional centralized methods for securing IoT networks often struggle to achieve a balance between privacy preservation and real-time threat detection. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel Federated Learning-Driven Cybersecurity Framework designed for IoT environments. Our approach enables decentralized data processing through local model training on edge devices, thereby ensuring data privacy. The locally trained models are securely aggregated using homomorphic encryption, enabling collaborative learning without exposing sensitive information. The framework leverages recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for anomaly detection, tailored specifically for IoT networks with constrained resources. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed system can detect complex cyber threats, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, with over 98% accuracy. Additionally, it achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency, with a 20% reduction in resource consumption compared to centralized approaches. This research bridges existing gaps in IoT cybersecurity by integrating federated learning principles with state-of-the- art threat detection techniques. Furthermore, it provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution tailored for diverse IoT applications. Future directions include the integration of blockchain for traceable model aggregation and the exploration of quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to strengthen the framework\u2019s security in evolving technological landscapes.

Introduction 1.1 Background The Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly evolved into a transformative technology, connecting billions of devices worldwide and driving innovation across diverse industries, including healthcare, smart cities, and manufacturing. By 2025, the global IoT landscape is expected to comprise more than 75 billion interconnected devices, contributing significantly to economic growth and technological advancement [1]. Despite these opportunities, the widespread adoption of IoT systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities that can compromise sensitive data and disrupt essential services. Attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults, malware infections, and unauthorized access to IoT networks are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating innovative and robust cybersecurity solutions [2]."
