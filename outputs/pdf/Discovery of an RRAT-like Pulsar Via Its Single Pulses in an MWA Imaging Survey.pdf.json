  "title": "Discovery of an RRAT-like Pulsar Via Its Single Pulses in an MWA Imaging Survey.pdf",
  "abstract": "We report the discovery of PSR J0031\u22125726 in the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA eXtended imaging survey at a Galactic latitude of b \u2248\u221260\u25e6. The pulsar exhibits both sporadic, extremely bright pulses reminiscent of rotating radio transients (RRATs) as well as a persistent, dimmer pulses. The bright pulses tend to arrive at later rotation phases than their dimmer counterparts, and have dramatically varying polarization angle curves, such that the integrated profile appears almost completely depolarized down to the system noise level. The rotation measure of individual pulses was found to sometimes vary by up to \u223c0.8 rad/m2, but was otherwise generally consistent with its average (ionosphere-corrected) value of 10.0\u00b10.1 rad/m2. We surmise that J0031\u22125726 may represent a class of pulsar that is intermediate between normal pulsars and RRATs. 1. INTRODUCTION Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars which are known to exhibit a wide variety of sin- gle pulse behaviors, including sub-pulse drifting (Drake & Craft 1968), nulling (Backer 1970), gi- ant pulse emission (Staelin & Reifenstein 1968; Knight et al. 2006), and microstructure (Hank- ins 1971). Various subclasses of pulsars can be defined in terms of the presence or absence these phenomena, as well as the time scales involved. For instance, the subclass of rotating radio tran- sients (RRATs) (McLaughlin et al. 2006) are those which exist in its null state for much longer\u2014up to weeks, months, and years\u2014than its burst state, which may only last for a few rotations (Konar & Deka 2019). The subclass of giant pulse emitters can be defined as pul- sars whose brightest pulses follow a power law distribution (although other definitions exist, cf. Johnston & Romani 2004). There does not yet exist a comprehensive model of pulsar radio emission that can satisfactorily account for all observed single pulse phenomena. Finding more pulsars with interesting and unique single-pulse behavior, and studying them in detail, remains an important exercise towards gaining a deeper understanding of the emission mechanism. Most known pulsars were discovered us- ing Fourier-domain methods which exploit the strict periodicity of the pulses (e.g. Manchester et al. 2001; Keith et al. 2010). Such methods are naturally less sensitive to pulsars with in- termittent or strongly fluctuating pulses, which can dilute the signal-to-noise (S/N) by leaking signal power away from the harmonics of the fundamental spin period. Famously, RRATs are so intermittent that their defining charac- teristic is that they are more easily detected via their single pulses rather than via a periodicity search (McLaughlin et al. 2006). Nowadays, ra- dio transient surveys often include single-pulse search techniques as a standard part of their data processing pipelines (Good et al. 2021; Dong et al. 2023; Grover et al. 2024a). arXiv:2502.02130v1 [astro-ph.HE] 4 Feb 2025"
