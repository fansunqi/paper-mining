  "abstract": "We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symme- try on a torus in terms of the representation of GL(2, Z). However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to unoriented surfaces in a way compat- ible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we can assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to unoriented surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry. 1 arXiv:2502.13532v1 [hep-th] 19 Feb 2025"
