  "abstract": "Scalable and secure data management is important in Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart water meters, where traditional blockchain storage can be restrictive due to high data volumes. This paper investigates a hybrid blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) approach designed to optimise storage efficiency, enhance throughput, and reduce block time by offloading large data off-chain to IPFS while preserving on-chain integrity. A substrate-based private blockchain was developed to store smart water meter (SWM) data, and controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate blockchain performance with and without IPFS. Key metrics, including block size, block time, and transaction throughput, were analysed across varying data volumes and node counts. Results show that integrating IPFS significantly reduces on-chain storage demands, leading to smaller block sizes, increased throughput, and improved block times compared to blockchain-only storage. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid blockchain-IPFS models for efficiently and securely managing high-volume IoT data.

This concept gained widespread attention following the publication of the foundational Bitcoin whitepaper by Nakamoto [1]. Blockchain combines various software and theoretical mechanisms, including cryptography, networking, hashing algorithms, and a unique storage model, to achieve decentralisation, peer-to-peer interaction, immutable storage and enhanced security. Data in the blockchain is organised into blocks that are sequentially created, appended, and cryptographically linked through hashes generated from the root hash of the previous block [2]. Research has shown promising applications for blockchain in data-intensive domains. For instance, Wenjun et al. [3] applied blockchain technology to optimise intelligent water management. However, as data-intensive applications like IoT networks, environmental monitoring, and financial transactions continue to grow, blockchain\u2019s limitations, particularly in storage capacity and latency, have become apparent [4], [5], [6]. For example, studies on blockchain-based smart water meter systems [7] highlight that constraints on block storage size can lead to bottlenecks and latency during block creation and finalisation. A promising approach to address these storage limitations is through off-chain storage solutions. Yang et al. [2] analysed different peer-to-peer (P2P) data networks such as Nasper [8], BitTorrent [9], Swarm [10], Storj [11] and the Hypercore"
