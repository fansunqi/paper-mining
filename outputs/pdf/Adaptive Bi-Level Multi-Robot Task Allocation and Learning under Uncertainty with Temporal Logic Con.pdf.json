  "title": "Adaptive Bi-Level Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Learning under Uncertainty with Temporal Logic Con.pdf",
  "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of multi-robot coordination under unknown robot transition models, ensuring that tasks specified by Time Window Temporal Logic are satisfied with user-defined prob- ability thresholds. We present a bi-level framework that integrates (i) high-level task allocation, where tasks are assigned based on the robots\u2019 estimated task completion probabilities and expected rewards, and (ii) low-level distributed policy learning and execution, where robots independently optimize auxiliary rewards while fulfill- ing their assigned tasks. To handle uncertainty in robot dynamics, our approach leverages real-time task execution data to iteratively refine expected task completion probabilities and rewards, enabling adaptive task allocation without explicit robot transition models. We theoretically validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating that the task assignments meet the desired probability thresholds with high confidence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through comprehensive simulations. KEYWORDS Multi-Robot Systems; Task Allocation; Temporal Logic; Reinforce- ment Learning 1 INTRODUCTION Efficient and high-quality task allocation plays a critical role in co- operative multi-robot applications, such as on-demand ridesharing and delivery [11], assembly lines [13], and warehouse logistics [42]. Recently, multi-robot task allocation with temporal constraints has attracted growing attention due to its significance in time-sensitive applications. For instance, [32] formulates a distributed constraint optimization problem to allocate tasks with time windows and ordering requirements to heterogeneous robots. [5] considers un- certainty in completing time-windowed tasks and combines high- level task allocation with low-level scheduling to minimize task incompletion. [26] addresses tasks with precedence constraints, proposing an algorithm that ensures the probability of task failure remains below a user-specified threshold under uncertainties in robot traits. Research in this area typically considers tasks that can be executed independently. Multi-robot systems often involve more complicated scenarios where tasks are logically and temporally correlated. For instance, in warehouse logistics, robots need to coordinate to retrieve items from multiple storage locations based on orders, inventory, and replacement options, then assemble and deliver them within a set time frame, with each step depending on the successful comple- tion of the previous one. Temporal logic (TL) provides a rigorous framework for specifying such temporal order and dependencies between tasks. Different methods have been proposed to coordinate robots to satisfy a global temporal logic formula, including graph search on product automata [28], sampling-based methods [14, 21], and optimization-based approaches [2, 15, 41]. Other works assign local temporal logic tasks to individual robots, employing methods such as receding horizon planning [34], path-finding on product graph [8], and integer programming-based planning [31]. Nevertheless, these studies do not address uncertainty, which is crucial for time- sensitive tasks. For instance, environmental factors like traffic jams can disrupt task execution within the required time window. Some prior studies [1, 3, 10, 12] employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize the probability of satisfying temporal logic con- straints under unknown transition dynamics, primarily focusing on single-robot systems. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been explored for joint policy learning with temporal logic ob- jectives [9, 38, 43]. Additionally, semi-decentralized methods [30], deep RL [23], and model-based RL [20] have been explored to im- prove learning efficiency. However, these MARL approaches either do not explicitly address system model uncertainty or assume full system knowledge, limiting their applicability in uncertain envi- ronments. Overall, there are research gaps in existing multi-robot task allo- cation, planning, and learning approaches, as they either assume the tasks are independent, neglect the uncertainty in system models, or unrealistically presume full knowledge of uncertainties. Addi- tionally, prior studies often aim to maximize robustness degree [23, 38], minimize incomplete tasks [5], or optimize some cost func- tions [14, 21]. While these approaches are effective, they often lack quantifiable guarantees on task satisfaction. Motivated by these gaps, this paper addresses multi-robot task allocation to ensure a specified probability of satisfying Time Win- dow Temporal Logic tasks under unknown transition dynamics. Additionally, a secondary objective is to maximize auxiliary reward functions for each robot based on user preferences. Fig. 1 illustrates an example where robots must transport materials within specific time windows with high probability while also performing auxiliary tasks such as identifying and monitoring traffic-prone intersections or returning to stations for future assignments. Our proposed formulation, which incorporates primary tasks and auxiliary objectives, has broader applicability in various scenarios, such as: (i) Search-and-rescue: Robots deliver supplies within time-critical windows while minimizing energy use or maximizing coverage to identify other areas needing help. (ii) Environmental monitoring: Drones monitor areas during specific intervals, such as wildlife peaks, while collecting additional data or conserving power for longer missions. In summary, this work makes the following contributions: arXiv:2502.10062v1 [cs.RO] 14 Feb 2025"
