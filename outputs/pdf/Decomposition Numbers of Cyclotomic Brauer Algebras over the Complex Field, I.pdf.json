  "title": "Decomposition Numbers of Cyclotomic Brauer Algebras over the Complex Field, I.pdf",
  "abstract": ". Following Nazarov\u2019s suggestion [23], we refer to the cyclotomic Nazarov-Wenzl algebra as the cyclotomic Brauer algebra. When the cyclotomic Brauer algebra is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of MIi,r\u2013 the tensor product of a simple scalar-type parabolic Verma module with the natural module in the parabolic BGG category O of types Bn, Cn and Dn, its decomposition numbers can theoretically be computed, based on general results from [1] and [29, Corollary 5.10]. This paper aims to establish explicit connections between the parabolic Verma modules that appear as subquotients of MIi,r and the right cell modules of the cyclotomic Brauer algebra under condition (1.12). It allows us to explicitly decompose MIi,r into a direct sum of indecomposable tilting modules by identifying their highest weights and multiplicities. Our result demonstrates that the decomposition numbers of such a cyclotomic Brauer algebra can be explicitly computed using the parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of types Bn, Cn, and Dn with suitable parabolic subgroups [32]. Finally, condition (1.12) is well-supported by a result of Wei Xiao presented in Section 6. 1. Introduction Throughout this paper, we work over C. All algebras and categories are de\ufb01ned over C. In his groundbreaking paper [2], Ariki established a remarkable result stating that K0( \u221e M r=0 Ha,r(u)-mod) \u2297Z C is isomorphic to an integral highest weight g-module. Here Ha,r(u) denotes the cyclotomic Hecke algebra of type G(a, 1, r) with parameters u = (u1, u2, . . . , ua), and g is either sl\u221e or \u02c6sle [2]. In this context, e represents the quantum characteristic of q, a parameter within Ha,r(u). Ariki further demonstrated that the dual canonical basis elements and canonical basis elements of the integral highest weight module correspond to simple Ha,r(u)-modules and their projective covers, respectively. When a = 1, this result con\ufb01rms Lascoux-Leclerc- Thibon\u2019s conjecture regarding the decomposition numbers of the Hecke algebra over C at a primitive eth root of unity. For two positive integers a and r, and two families of parameters u = (u1, u2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ua), and \u03c9 = (\u03c9i)i\u2208N, Ariki, Mathas and Rui [3] introduced a class of associative algebras, known as the cyclotomic Nazarov-Wenzl algebras Ba,r(u), aiming to replace the cyclotomic Hecke algebras in Ariki\u2019s framework. The cyclotomic Nazarov-Wenzl algebra is a cyclotomic quotient of the a\ufb03ne Wenzl algebra in [22]. Based on Nazarov\u2019s suggestion [23], we refer to the a\ufb03ne Wenzl algebra, and the cyclotomic Nazarov-Wenzl algebra as the a\ufb03ne Brauer algebra, and the cyclotomic Brauer algebra, respectively.
