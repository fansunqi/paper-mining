  "abstract": "\u2014Edge computing has emerged as a paradigm to bring low-latency and bandwidth-intensive applications close to end- users. However, edge computing platforms still face challenges related to resource constraints, connectivity, and security. We present GENIO, a novel platform that integrates edge computing within existing Passive Optical Network (PON) infrastructures. GENIO enhances central offices with computational and storage resources, enabling telecom operators to leverage their existing PON networks as a distributed edge computing infrastructure. Through simulations, we show the feasibility of GENIO in supporting real-world edge scenarios, and its better performance compared to a traditional edge computing architecture.

INTRODUCTION Traditionally, edge computing and broadband access net- works have been separated from each other. Edge computing platforms focus on running IT applications and services closer to users, either on their devices or on local fog servers. These platforms enable low-latency applications and have been used in several domains such as smart cities, smart infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. On the other hand, access networks provide access for end users to the Internet, ensuring high uplink and downlink speeds. Passive Optical Networks (PONs) have emerged as a standard among telecom operators for access network technology [1]. In practice, deploying an edge computing platform still faces significant challenges. Edge devices provide limited computa- tional and storage resources, which can be a bottleneck in computationally intensive applications. Using fog servers is also difficult because they either require dedicated servers and connectivity (e.g., on a local wired or wireless network), which incurs significant costs, or they have to be connected through the Internet, which hampers low latency. Furthermore, security and privacy are critical concerns because sensitive data at the edge are exposed to physical and digital attacks. These threats place an additional burden on the security and management of edge and fog servers. To address these challenges, telecom operators are exploring the placement of applications in central offices (i.e., physical hubs to which users connect) using the telecom infrastructure as an edge computing system [2], [3]. Previous studies have been focused primarily on theoretical design of algorithms for scheduling edge computing tasks (such as, using reinforcement learning) [4], [5]. However, these studies do not consider other aspects that are related to the deployment, orchestration, and management of an edge computing platform. In line with these trends, we propose the GENIO platform (Edge cloud platform enabled by a new intelligent OLT for GPON networks). GENIO is a joint industry-academia R&D project that aims to seamlessly integrate edge computing with PON high-speed broadband networks, overcome existing barriers, and bridge the gap between IT applications and users. The main goal of GENIO is to enhance elements of the PON infrastructure, particularly Optical Line Terminals (OLT) and Optical Network Units (ONU), with the capability to run edge services with low latency and guaranteed bandwidth. The GE- NIO platform will be a cost-effective opportunity for telecom operators to provide computing and storage resources using their existing PON infrastructure. ONUs will be extended with smart embedded systems at the user site, and OLTs will evolve into IT servers with computational and storage capabilities. In this work, we present a new software architecture for edge computing on PON infrastructures, which integrates well with off-the-shelf software and hardware of OLT systems. In particular, the architecture leverages recent technology for \u201cnetwork softwarization\u201d, including VOLTHA/SEBA and ONOS. The GENIO architecture introduces several compo- nents for orchestration and management, that are deployed over the cloud, edge, and far edge layers. Moreover, the proposal envisions a workflow that includes both providers of IT applications and end-users that use these IT applications through the PON infrastructure. We also discuss security practices and solutions to harden OLTs against physical and digital attacks. Finally, our work analyzes the feasibility of the GENIO project using off-the-shelf CPUs for use cases of industrial relevance, and compares performance with respect to a traditional edge computing architecture.

BACKGROUND Over the past decade, optical fiber networks have been extensively deployed, particularly in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) architectures, relying heavily on Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies. Forecasts [6] suggest that approximately 40 percent of the global population will have fixed FTTH connections by 2026, underscoring the pivotal role of PON technologies. PON networks, with their passive optical distri- bution networks, have proven to be cost-effective and energy- efficient, with various standardized architectures.
