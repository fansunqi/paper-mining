  "abstract": "Lorenzo Calibbi ,1, \u2217Tong Li ,1, \u2020 Lopamudra Mukherjee ,1, \u2021 and Michael A. Schmidt 2, \u00a7 1School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China 2Sydney Consortium for Particle Physics and Cosmology, School of Physics, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of B+ \u2192K+ + invisible events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) predic- tion for B+ \u2192K+\u03bd\u00af\u03bd, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess. \u2217calibbi@nankai.edu.cn \u2020 litong@nankai.edu.cn \u2021 lopamudra.physics@gmail.com \u00a7 m.schmidt@unsw.edu.au arXiv:2502.04900v1 [hep-ph] 7 Feb 2025"
