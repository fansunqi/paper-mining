  "title": "A Comprehensive Review of U-Net and Its Variants Advances and Applications in Medical Image Segmenta.pdf",
  "abstract": "Medical images often exhibit low and blured contrast between lesions and surounding tisues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant chalenges in segmentation. Therefore , precise segmentation of lesions has become an esential prerequisite for patient condition asesment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U - Net model in recent years . It improves segmentation performance and is extensively aplied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to ofer technical suport for consistent quantitative lesion an alysis methods. First , this paper clasifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U - Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, inovative designs, and limitations of each aproach are discused in detail. Second , we sumarize the four central improvement mechanisms of the U - Net and U - Net variant algorithms: the jump - connection mechanism, residual - conection mechanism, 3D - UNet, and transformer mechanism . Finaly, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and comonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic sumary and reference for researchers in related fields, and w e lok forward to designing more eficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U - Net network. Keywords: U - Net ; network architecture ; transformer mechanism; segmentation performance 1. Introduction Computer vision has greatly increased the inteligence level of medical image procesing, reduced the inteligence level of medical staff, and improved the quality and eficiency of medical services. Simultaneously, it establishes a robust technical foundation for advancing inteligent healthcare and telemedicine to higher levels in the future. In terms of image analysis and recognition, whether traditional X - rays, CT scans, MRI, or more advanced PET and optical imaging, computer vision technology can autom aticaly recognize and analyze the structure and features in medical images, such as identifying key information such as lesions, organ contours, and vascular distributions , which can help doctors quickly locate and judge posible lesions . Convolutional neural networks (CNs ) have the potential to suport clinicians in the early screening and diagnosis of diseases, thereby enhancing both detection rates and diagnostic accuracy for conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and brain lesions . J et al. designed a fuly convolutional neural network (FCN) [1] . Compared with CNs , the most prominent feature is the use of convolutional layers instead of fuly conected layers. The FCN"
