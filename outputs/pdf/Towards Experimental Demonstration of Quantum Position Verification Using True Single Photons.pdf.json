  "abstract": "However, recently, it has been shown that by combining quantum mechanics with the speed of light limit of special relativity, this might be possible: quantum position verification. Here we demonstrate experimentally a protocol that uses two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference at a beamsplitter, which, in combination with two additional beam splitters and 4 detectors is rendering the protocol resilient to loss. With this we are able to show first results towards an experimental demonstration of quantum position verification. Since the geographical location is often a good credential of a party in communications, verification thereof could add a useful layer to communication security \u2013 this is the case, for instance, with data centers, banks, govern- ment buildings, a lab in a quantum network, or even a satellite. Classically, position verification is only possi- ble securely if a shared private key is established which requires physical contact of the parties [1]. In quantum mechanics, mainly thanks to the no-cloning theorem, this can be avoided [2\u20135]. The general scheme of quantum position verification (QPV) is shown in Fig. 1: Two ver- ifiers V0 and V1 share a private communication channel and aim to confirm the location of a third party, the prover P. The verifiers send classical and quantum in- formation, the prover performs a task and returns clas- sical (and possibly quantum) information. The verifiers use this information and the timing and conclude if the prover was at the claimed position or not. This scheme is one-dimensional but can be extended to higher dimen- sions [6]. However, it quickly was found that attackers with shared entanglement and exploiting quantum teleportation can break quantum position verification protocols, after first attempts [7\u20139] a general attack was found [10]. This find- ing has stimulated broad research into the topic [11\u201325], and it was found that by including classical-information cryptographic tasks, QPV protocols can be made secure for all practical purposes such that attackers require a very large amount of shared entanglement that does only depend on the amount of classical information used in the QPV protocol [26, 27]. \u2217kanneworff@physics.leidenuniv.nl \u2020 loeffler@physics.leidenuniv.nl d A A P V V1 1 0 0 Position t = 2d c LOCC attack Honest Prover x x y y z z z z ' ' Time |\u03a8 \u3009 0 |\u03a8 \u3009 0 |\u03a8 \u3009 1 |\u03a8 \u3009 1 Figure 1.

Dashed grey lines show a potential form of attack by two adversaries (A0 and A1) positioned around the supposed location of the prover that try to mimic the honest prover responses and are restricted to local operations and classical communica- tion (LOCC). Symbols are explained in the text. In real-world QPV, the quantum information is sent by photons, and two major loopholes emerge from this: First, photons are susceptible to loss during transmission, which opens up a generic attack strategy since the ad- versaries can claim loss if their measurements have been performed in the wrong basis, for instance. Therefore, fully loss-tolerant protocols are required [23, 28, 29], the first having been developed in Refs. [11, 25]. We will in- arXiv:2502.04125v1 [quant-ph] 6 Feb 2025"
