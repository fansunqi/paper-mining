  "abstract": "Creating custom artifacts with computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines typically requires mastery of complex computer- aided design (CAD) software. To eliminate this user barrier, we introduced Draw2Cut, a novel system that allows users to design and fabricate artifacts by sketching directly on physical materials. Draw2Cut employs a custom-drawing language to convert user- drawn lines, symbols, and colors into toolpaths, thereby enabling users to express their creative intent intuitively. The key features include real-time alignment between material and virtual toolpaths, a preview interface for validation, and an open-source platform \u2217These authors contributed equally to this work.

Through technical evaluations and user studies, we demonstrate that Draw2Cut lowers the entry barrier for per- sonal fabrication, enabling novices to create customized artifacts with precision and ease. Our findings highlight the potential of the system to enhance creativity, engagement, and accessibility in CNC-based woodworking.
