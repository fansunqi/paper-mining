INTRODUCTION Quantum entanglement [1\u20136] is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. It plays a pivotal role in distinguishing the quantum from the classical world. The principle of entanglement monogamy [7] says that a quantum system, once entangled with one subsystem, will constrain its level of entanglement with the remaining subsystems. The monogamy relations not only dictate the distribution of entan- glement within multipartite settings, but also applies to various realms of quantum physics, such as in characterizing the construction of a quantum system [9\u201311] and in proving the nocloning theorem [12]. It also acts as an important gradient in enhancing the security of quantum cryptography [13]. Mathematically, the monogamy of entanglement is characterized through an entanglement measure E, applied to a tripartite system \u03c1ABC, as follows E(\u03c1A|BC) \u2265E(\u03c1AB) + E(\u03c1AC), (1) which is commonly recognized as the CKW inequality [7], where \u03c1AB = TrC(\u03c1ABC) and \u03c1AC = TrB(\u03c1ABC) are the reduced density matrices by tracing over the subsystem C and B, respectively, with TrB (TrC) denoting the partial trace with respect to the subsystem B (C). In Ref. [8], the authors es- tablished the longstanding conjecture by Coffman et al., demonstrating that the distribution of bipartite quantum entanglement, quantified by the tangle \u03c4 [7], across N qubits adheres to a tight inequality: \u03c4\u03c1A1A2 + \u03c4\u03c1A1A3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c4\u03c1A1AN \u2264\u03c4\u03c1A1|A2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AN . Here, \u03c4\u03c1A1|A2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AN represents the bipartite quantum entanglement measured by the tangle when the system is bipartitioned between A1 and the combined subsystem A2A3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 AN. In Ref. [14], the authors introduced a simple identity that effectively delineates the trade-off between entanglement and classical correlation, thereby providing a solid foundation for the derivation of stringent monogamy relations. Furthermore, the authors also established diverse monoga- mous trade-off relations involving other entanglement and correlation measures. In Ref.
