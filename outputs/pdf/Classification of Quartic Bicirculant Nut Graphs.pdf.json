  "abstract": "A graph is called a nut graph if zero is its eigenvalue of multiplicity one and its corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. A graph is a bicirculant if it admits an automorphism with two equally sized vertex orbits. There are four classes of connected quartic bicirculant graphs. We classify the quartic bicirculant graphs that are nut graphs by investigating properties of each of these four classes. Keywords: nut graph, bicirculant graph, quartic graph, graph spectrum. MSC 2020: 05C50, 05C25, 05C75. 1 Introduction The motivation for this paper comes from the recent interest for nut graphs, i.e., graphs having zero as eigenvalue of multiplicity one, with the corresponding eigenvector with no zero entries [7, 29, 30]. In a series of papers [5, 6, 11, 14], the problem of existence of nut graphs among various families of graphs has been investigated. In particular, the pairs (n, d) for which there exists at least one d-regular nut graph of order n have been determined up to degree d \u226411 in [20], and for degree d = 12 in [6]. The methods used in these papers included mainly circulant graphs. Based on these results, [10, 14] expanded this approach, with [11] completely resolving the problem of existence of circulant nut graphs of a given order and degree. Note that every circulant graph is a Cayley graph and, therefore, it is vertex-transitive. It has been observed that each vertex-transitive nut graph has an even degree [20]. One can conclude that the smallest degree for which a circulant nut graph exists is four. The quartic circulant nut graphs were classi\ufb01ed in [12], while the cubic tricirculant nut graphs were classi\ufb01ed in [13]. For more results on the symmetries of nut graphs, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 9]. In this paper, the complete classi\ufb01cation of quartic bicirculant nut graphs is given. We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne bicirculant graphs. Then we describe in more detail the connected quartic bicirculant graphs and give the statement of our main theorem, which gives the classi\ufb01cation of quartic bicirculant nut graphs. A bicirculant is a graph of order n = 2m admitting an automorphism with two vertex orbits of equal size m. It can be described as follows; see for example [27]. Given an integer m \u22653 and sets S, T, R \u2286Zm such that S = \u2212S, T = \u2212T, R \u0338= \u2205and 0 \u0338\u2208S \u222aT, the graph BiCirc(m; S, T, R) has vertex set V = {x0, . . . , xm\u22121, y0, . . . , ym\u22121} and edge set E = {xixi+j | i \u2208Zm, j \u2208S} \u222a{yiyi+j | i \u2208Zm, j \u2208T} \u222a{xiyi+j | i \u2208Zm, j \u2208R}. 1"
