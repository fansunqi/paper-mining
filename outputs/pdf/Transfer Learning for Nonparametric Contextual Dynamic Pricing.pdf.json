  "abstract": "Dynamic pricing strategies are crucial for firms to maximize revenue by adjusting prices based on market conditions and customer characteristics. However, designing optimal pricing strategies becomes challenging when historical data are limited, as is often the case when launch- ing new products or entering new markets. One promising approach to overcome this limitation is to leverage information from related products or markets to inform the focal pricing decisions. In this paper, we explore transfer learning for nonparametric contextual dynamic pricing under a covariate shift model, where the marginal distributions of covariates differ between source and target domains while the reward functions remain the same. We propose a novel Trans- fer Learning for Dynamic Pricing (TLDP) algorithm that can effectively leverage pre-collected data from a source domain to enhance pricing decisions in the target domain. The regret upper bound of TLDP is established under a simple Lipschitz condition on the reward function. To establish the optimality of TLDP, we further derive a matching minimax lower bound, which includes the target-only scenario as a special case and is presented for the first time in the lit- erature. Extensive numerical experiments validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods and highlighting its practical utility in real-world applications. 1 Introduction Dynamic pricing is a fundamental strategy used across many industries to maximize revenue by adjusting prices based on market conditions (e.g. Araman and Caldentey, 2009; Besbes and Zeevi, 2009). In recent years, the rapid growth of online marketplaces and advances in data collection have further enabled sellers to use contextual information, such as customer characteristics, product features and market trends, to make more informed pricing decisions. This has fostered research in contextual dynamic pricing (e.g. Wang et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024), which further incorporates in-depth information to optimize pricing strategies. Effective dynamic pricing involves balancing the exploration of the unknown revenue model with the exploitation of the estimated revenue model to maximize rewards. The revenue model, representing the relationship between covariates, prices and revenue, has been explored under both parametric and nonparametric settings in the literature. The parametric settings impose specific assumptions on the revenue model and have been widely studied (e.g. Qiang and Bayati, 2016; Javanmard and Nazerzadeh, 2019; Ban and Keskin, 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2024). 1 arXiv:2501.18836v1 [cs.LG] 31 Jan 2025"
