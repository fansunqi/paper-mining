  "abstract": "\u2014The variety of building blocks and algorithms in- corporated in data-centric and ML-assisted solutions is high, contributing to two challenges: selection of most effective set and order of building blocks, as well as achieving such a selection with minimum cost. Considering that ML-assisted solution design is influenced by the extent of available data, as well as available knowledge of the target system, it is advantageous to be able to select matching building blocks. We introduce the first iteration of our InfoPos framework, allowing the placement of use-cases considering the available positions (levels), i.e., from poor to rich, of knowledge and data dimensions. With that input, designers and developers can reveal the most effective corresponding choice(s), streamlining the solution design process. The results from our demonstrator, an anomaly identification use-case for industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, reflects achieved effects upon the use of different building blocks throughout knowledge and data positions. The achieved ML model performance is considered as the indicator. Our data processing code and the composed data sets are publicly available.

INTRODUCTION One of the important activities involved in a successful strategy towards predictive maintenance for industrial Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS) is anomaly detection and identifi- cation. Examples of such systems are semiconductor pho- tolithography machines, production printing machines, die bonder machines, and so forth. What these systems all have in common is the presence of highly complex, multi-node compute and control elements, limited domain of operational tasks (highly purpose-built), and continuous high yield targets for machine production output. In the context of industrial CPS, data-centric solutions con- suming time-series data from machine sensors, have proven to be highly capable [1]. For such solutions, there are numerous data processing and Machine Learning algorithms suitable for time-series data analysis, to choose from. Generally speaking, with industrial CPS, we also have the abundance of available data, which can be collected from a multitude of available sensors, especially in modern CPS, while the machine oper- ates. Needless to say, these machines are intended to operate non-stop, at full capacity, requiring any data collection and monitoring to be well-planned. This publication is part of the project ZORRO with project number KICH1.ST02.21.003 of the research programme Key Enabling Technologies (KIC), which is (partly) financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Contrary to one\u2019s initial assumption, the abundance of data becomes a challenge. Besides the complexities and resource cost imposed with excessive data collection, high amounts of data does not necessarily lead to better prediction. As such, it is highly advantageous to be able to select the right data processing steps, choose the best ML algorithm, and focus on the most effective portion of the data. It is even more advantageous to know which of the above ingredients (data processing, ML algorithm and data subset) match and work best, allowing for the selection of the most effective combination, should one ingredient be restricted. For instance, if we are limited to a specific part of data, the best complementary ML algorithm shall be considered. Most importantly, we want to know all such compatibilities upfront. Contribution: We introduce the first iteration of our In- foPos framework, intended to support designers and engineers in the selection of most effective elements when building ML-assisted solutions for industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Examples of such element variations are the type of ML algorithm, data processing/transformation steps applied, or the level of these steps, and the considered portion of data. We demonstrate the use of InfoPos framework within the context of an anomaly identification use-case. Our results are based on real data and our data processing code, as well as the generated data sets, are made publicly available. In short, we provide: \u2022 The InfoPos framework as a pre-design support tool for ML-assisted solution design fine-tuning. \u2022 Preliminary results from a real-world platform, as our demonstrator use-case, covering numerous combinations of available knowledge, available data and traditional ML algorithms. \u2022 Publicly available processed data sets [2] and the data workflow code [3], covering the data processing and ML model training.

BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS To explain our perspective and what we consider roles of knowledge and data are in shaping data-centric and ML- assisted solutions, it is important to clarify the terminology first. Throughout this paper, what we consider as data is primarily metric traces collected from a multitude of available sensors, a.k.a., Extra-Functional Behaviour metrics. Indus- trial CPS machines, especially modern ones, are equipped with sensors, mainly intended for product quality control. We consider both individual hardware sensors, e.g., a torque arXiv:2502.10331v1 [cs.LG] 14 Feb 2025"
