  "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the power-expansion/OPE expansion in super- renormalizable QFTs. In comparison to \u201cmarginal\u201d short distance asymptotics, the power- expansion in super-renormalizable theory has a higher level of correlation with the coupling constant expansion, and the \ufb01xed-point perturbation theory for the coe\ufb03cient functions su\ufb00ers increasing level of IR divergences when the order of power-expansion/coupling con- stant expansion increases. This increasing IR sensitivity anticipates the presence of vacuum condensates of non-trivial local operators in the OPE expansion, which not only cancel the IR divergences for coe\ufb03cient functions through their UV divergences, but also shape the structure of logarithms at each power in the power-expansion. This UV-IR correspondence has been used to argue for the renormalon cancellation between coe\ufb03cient functions and operators in marginal asymptotics, where the residue IR sensitivity of coe\ufb03cient func- tions to be canceled by the operators manifests through high-order factorial growths after renormalization subtraction. However, in supper-renomalizable theory, high-order behavior in coupling constants in the coe\ufb03cient functions is simultaneously large-order behavior in the power expansion, and one may wonder if there are also factorial growths for high-order/power terms in the coe\ufb03cient functions, as they also require large-numbers of IR subtractions. In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE- expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an O(N)-model with N-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading 1 N order in the large-N expansion, we show that the IR subtractions indeed cause addition factorial enhancements for large order/power terms in the coe\ufb03cient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coe\ufb03cient functions and operators only o\ufb00-diagonally across di\ufb00erent powers. The facto- rial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former is similar to the \u201cUV renormalon\u201d of coe\ufb03cient functions and cancels with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter is similar to \u201cIR renormalon\u201d and cancels with factorial enhancements of renormalized op- erators at higher powers in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent."
