  "abstract": "Recent work by Shehper et al. (2024) demonstrated that the well-known Akbulut- Kirby AK(3) balanced presentation of the triv- ial group is stably AC-equivalent to the triv- ial presentation. This result eliminates AK(3) as a potential counterexample to the stable Andrews-Curtis conjecture. In this paper, we present an alternative proof of this result us- ing an automated deduction approach. We pro- vide several transformation sequences, derived from two di\ufb00erent proofs generated by the auto- mated theorem prover Prover9, that certify the stable AC-equivalence of AK(3) and the triv- ial presentation. We conclude by proposing a challenge to develop computational methods for searching stable AC-transformations. 1 Introduction The Andrews-Curtis conjecture (ACC) [3] is a well- known open problem in combinatorial group theory deeply linked with the questions in low-dimensional topology. ACC states that every balanced presenta- tion of the trivial group can be transformed into a trivial presentation by a sequence of simple transfor- mations. Several computational methods have been sug- gested for e\ufb03ciently searching for such simpli\ufb01cations (e.g. [5, 13, 16, 7, 6, 9, 15]). However, there are still in\ufb01nite sets of balanced trivial group presenta- tions that could serve as potential counterexamples to the conjecture, for which the necessary simpli\ufb01ca- tions have not yet been discovered. For a group presentation \u27e8x1, . . . , xn; r1, . . . rm\u27e9 with generators xi, and relators rj, consider the fol- lowing transformations. AC1 Replace some ri by r\u22121 i . AC2 Replace some ri by ri \u00b7 rj, j \u0338= i. AC3 Replace some ri by w \u00b7 ri \u00b7 w\u22121 where w is any word in the generators. AC4 Introduce a new generator y and relator y or delete a generator y and relator y. Two presentations g and g\u2032 are called Andrews- Curtis equivalent (AC-equivalent) if one of them can be obtained from the other by applying a \ufb01nite sequence of transformations of the types (AC1) - (AC3). Two presentations are stably AC- equivalent if one of them can be obtained from the other by applying a \ufb01nite sequence of transforma- tions of the types (AC1)\u2013(AC4). A presentation \u27e8x1, . . . , xn; r1, . . . rm\u27e9is called balanced if n = m. A balanced presentation is called AC-simpli\ufb01able, or AC-trivializable, if it is equivalent to trivial presenta- tion \u27e8x1, . . . , xn; x1, . . . xn\u27e9. Conjecture 1 (Andrews-Curtis [3]) If \u27e8x1, . . . , xn; r1, . . . rn\u27e9 is a balanced presentation of the trivial group it is AC-equivalent to the trivial presentation \u27e8x1, . . . , xn; x1, . . . xn\u27e9 1"
