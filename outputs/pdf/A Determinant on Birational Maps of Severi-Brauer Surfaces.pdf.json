  "abstract": ". We define a determinant on the group of automorphisms of non-trivial Severi- Brauer surfaces over a perfect field. Using the generators and relations, we extend this determinant to birational maps between Severi-Brauer surfaces. Using this determinant and a group homomorphism found in [BSY23] we can determine the abelianization of the group of birational transformations of a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface. This is the first example of an abelianization of the group of birational transformations of a geometrically rational surface where the automorphisms are non trivial. Using the abelianization we find maximal subgroups of the group of birational transformations of a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface over a perfect field. Contents 1.
