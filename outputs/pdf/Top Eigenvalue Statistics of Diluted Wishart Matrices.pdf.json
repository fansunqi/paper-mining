  "abstract": ". Using the replica method, we compute analytically the average largest eigenvalue of diluted covariance matrices of the form J = XT X, where X is a N \u00d7 M sparse data matrix, in the limit of large N, M with \ufb01xed ratio. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the N-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be e\ufb03ciently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identi\ufb01ed with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm. We \ufb01nd excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation. 1. Introduction In recent decades, we have witnessed an unprecedented surge in the amount of information available for processing and forecasting, marking the emergence of the Big Data era. Contemporary data analysis challenges frequently involve processing datasets with numerous variables and observations. This high-dimensional nature of data is particularly evident in \ufb01elds such as climate studies, genetics, biomedical imaging, and economics [1]. Consider a scenario where one conducts N measurements of M variables that characterise a system. These variables might represent, for instance, assets in a stock market or a collection of climate observables, with measurements taken simultaneously at N di\ufb00erent time points. The collected data can be organised into an N \u00d7 M matrix X, where element Xij represents the i-th measurement of the j-th variable. From"
