  "title": "Radio Signatures of a Massive Black Hole in GHZ9 at Z \u223c 10.pdf",
  "abstract": "Synergies between the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Chandra X-ray observatory have advanced the observational frontier by detecting a handful of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) beyond z \u223c10. In particular, the recent discovery of a candidate 8 \u00d7 107 M\u2299black hole (BH) in the galaxy GHZ9 at z = 10.4 favors massive seed formation channels for these objects. Motivated by prospects for their detection in radio by recent studies, we estimate radio \ufb02uxes for GHZ9 and explore the possibility of their detection with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and next- generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). We \ufb01nd that ngVLA should be able to detect radio emission from GHZ9 for integration times as short as 1 hr while SKA will require integration times of up to 100 hr. We also \ufb01nd that radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that due to H II regions and supernovae in its host galaxy. The detection of a few hundred nJy radio signal at frequencies > 2 GHz will be a smoking gun for the presence of a BH in GHZ9.

JWST has now revealed a population of previously hidden low- luminosity AGNs at z > 4, with a handful of candidates at z > 10 (Kokorev et al. 2023; Lambrides et al. 2024; Larson et al. 2023; Kocevski et al. 2023; Maiolino et al. 2023, 2024; Furtak et al. 2024). These BHs are typically a few 105 \u2212107 M\u2299with bolometric luminosities of 1044 \u22121045 erg s\u22121. This suggests that massive seeds from the direct col- lapse scenario might be their origin (Whalen & Fryer 2012; Latif et al. 2013; Hosokawa et al. 2013; Woods et al. 2017; Haemmerl\u00b4e et al. 2018; Latif et al. 2022a; Schleicher et al. 2022; Volonteri et al. 2023; Patrick et al. 2023). Synergies between Chandra X-ray and JWST near infrared (NIR) ob- servations have now revealed BHs beyond z \u223c10, like the 4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299BH in UHZ1 at z = 10.3 (Bogd\u00b4an et al. 2023; Goulding et al. 2023) and now the 8 \u00d7 107 M\u2299BH in GHZ9 at z = 10.4 (Kov\u00b4acs et al. 2024, hereafter K24). \u22c6E-mail: latifne@gmail.com GHZ9 was originally found in the UNCOVER and GLASS surveys by Atek et al. (2023) and Castellano et al. (2023) as a lensed dropout Lyman-break galaxy behind the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. Its redshift z, stellar mass, M\u22c6, and star formation rate (SFR) are derived from stellar en- ergy distribution (SED) models and vary from 10.37+0.32 \u22121.09 - 9.35+0.77 \u22120.35, 4.9+2.0 \u22122.6 \u00d7 107 - 3.3+2.9 \u22122.4 \u00d7 108 M\u2299, and 0.56+0.23 \u22120.29 - 14.4+15.0 \u22127.3 M\u2299yr\u22121, respectively. Recently, GHZ9 was con- \ufb01rmed to be an AGN candidate in Chandra X-ray observa- tions (K24). These BHs are overmassive relative to their host galaxies, 2-3 orders of magnitude above the local MBH \u2212M\u22c6 relation. Both NIR and X-rays are obscured by dust in the host galaxies while radio waves escape. Therefore, radio fol- lowups of these sources will be crucial in con\ufb01rming the pres- ence of BHs in future obscured AGN candidates and probing their formation pathways. Previous studies indicate that BHs \u2273106 M\u2299could be detected at z \u227213 \u221214 by ngVLA and SKA in the coming decade (Whalen et al. 2023; Latif et al. 2024a,b). Recently, Whalen et al. (2023) found that SKA and the ngVLA could detect radio emission from the BH in UHZ1 with integra- tion times of 10 - 100 hr and 1 - 10 hr, respectively. Here we determine if the existence of a BH in GHZ9 can be con- \ufb01rmed by detection of radio \ufb02ux, taking into account thermal bremsstrahlung emission from H II regions and synchrotron \u00a9 2024 The Authors"
