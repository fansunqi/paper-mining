  "abstract": "\u2014The fuzzy job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) emerges as an innovative extension to the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), incorporating a layer of uncertainty that aligns the problem more closely with the complexities of real-world manufacturing environments. This improvement increases the computational complexity of deriving the solution while improv- ing its applicability. In the domain of deterministic scheduling, neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has recently demon- strated remarkable efficacy. However, its application to the realm of fuzzy scheduling has been relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the feasibility of employing neural networks to assimilate and process fuzzy information for the resolution of FJSSP, thereby leveraging the advancements in NCO to enhance fuzzy scheduling methodolo- gies. To achieve this, we approach the FJSSP as a generative task and introduce an expectation-maximization algorithm-based autoregressive model (EMARM) to address it. During training, our model alternates between generating scheduling schemes from given instances (E-step) and adjusting the autoregressive model weights based on these generated schemes (M-step). This novel methodology effectively navigates around the substantial hurdle of obtaining ground-truth labels, which is a prevalent issue in NCO frameworks. In testing, the experimental results demonstrate the superior capability of EMARM in addressing the FJSSP, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for practical applications in fuzzy scheduling.

INTRODUCTION T HE job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a well- established combinatorial optimization problem (COP) that holds both theoretical significance and practical relevance [1]\u2013[3]. The JSSP describes the processing time in the form of crisp numbers. However, in real-world manufacturing sce- narios, numerous uncertain factors, such as human variability [4] and machine flexibility [5], often preclude the accurate specification of processing times. To overcome this limitation, the fuzzy JSSP (FJSSP) that represents processing times with fuzzy numbers has emerged and drawn extensive attention [6]. Current algorithms for the FJSSP predominantly employ heuristic algorithms. Li et al. [7] contributed to the field by developing a bi-population balancing multiobjective evolu- tionary algorithm tailored for the distributed flexible FJSSP. They introduced an innovative crossover operator and two cooperative population environmental selection mechanisms, which effectively balanced the convergence and diversity ca- pabilities of the algorithm. Zhang et al. [8] proposed a multi- objective evolutionary algorithm that integrated clustering and hierarchical estimation techniques, addressing the challenge of maintaining a balance between the diversity and convergence of nondominated solutions while ensuring overall convergence. Gao et al. [9] crafted a differential evolution algorithm with a novel selection mechanism, enhancing the solution of FJSSP. Li et al. [10] enhanced an artificial immune system algorithm for the flexible FJSSP by incorporating simulated annealing, thereby boosting its exploration capabilities. Sun et al. [11] created an effective hybrid cooperative coevolution algorithm aimed at minimizing the fuzzy makespan of the flexible FJSSP, with a combination of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms significantly improving the convergence ability. Wang et al. [12] utilized fuzzy relative entropy to convert a multiobjective FJSSP into a single-objective problem and designed a hybrid adaptive differential evolution algorithm to address it. Pan et al. [13] focused on the energy-efficient flexible FJSSP and developed a bi-population evolutionary arXiv:2502.00018v1 [cs.AI] 11 Jan 2025"
