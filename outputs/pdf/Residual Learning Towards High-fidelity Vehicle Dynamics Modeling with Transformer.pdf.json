  "abstract": "\u2014The vehicle dynamics model serves as a vital compo- nent of autonomous driving systems, as it describes the temporal changes in vehicle state. In a long period, researchers have made significant endeavors to accurately model vehicle dynamics. Tra- ditional physics-based methods employ mathematical formulae to model vehicle dynamics, but they are unable to adequately describe complex vehicle systems due to the simplifications they entail. Recent advancements in deep learning-based methods have addressed this limitation by directly regressing vehicle dynamics. However, the performance and generalization capabilities still require further enhancement. In this letter, we address these problems by proposing a vehicle dynamics correction system that leverages deep neural networks to correct the state residuals of a physical model instead of directly estimating the states. This system greatly reduces the difficulty of network learning and thus improves the estimation accuracy of vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, we have developed a novel Transformer-based dynamics residual correction network, DyTR. This network implicitly represents state residuals as high-dimensional queries, and iteratively updates the estimated residuals by interacting with dynamics state features. The experiments in simulations demonstrate the proposed system works much better than physics model, and our proposed DyTR model achieves the best perfor- mances on dynamics state residual correction task, reducing the state prediction errors of a simple 3 DoF vehicle model by an average of 92.3% and 59.9% in two dataset, respectively.

INTRODUCTION A CQUIRING high-precision models of complex vehicle dynamical systems is critical in Autonomous Driving (AD) researches, due to its ability to truthfully mimic a real vehicle\u2019s dynamics, thus helping to develop and tune vehicle planning and control modules [1], [2]. Inaccurate state predictions from the dynamic models will result in an incor- rectly optimized trajectory and eventually lead to inappropriate vehicle motions, hindering the safety of AD systems [3]. Over the decades of development in vehicle dynamics research, the field has witnessed significant advancements and paradigm shifts. Some researches attempt to directly approximate vehicle dynamics, which is categorized as the This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foun- dation of China (52394264, 52472449, 52372414, 52402499), Beijing Nat- ural Science Foundation (23L10038, L231008), Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Z241100003524013, Z241100003524009), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2024M761636). 1Jinyu Miao, Rujun Yan, Bowei Zhang, Tuopu Wen, Kun Jiang, Mengmeng Yang, Jin Huang, and Diange Yang are with the School of Vehicle and Mobil- ity, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.jinyu.miao97@gmail.com 2Zhihua Zhong is with Chinese Academy of Engineering, Beijing, China. \u2217Corresponding author: Diange Yang, Kun Jiang, and Tuopu Wen Fig. 1.

Early solutions under the DSE frame- work focus on developing sophisticated physics-based models, from simple point-mass model [4], single-track model [5], to double-track model [6]. This evolution signifies the deepening of researchers\u2019 understanding of complex vehicle systems, and has led to a gradual increase in the precision and Degree-of- Freedom (DoF) of vehicle dynamics state estimation. How- ever, these physics-based vehicle dynamics models inevitably drift for long-horizon state prediction due to simplification in modeling. This phenomenon is even significant when the DoF of vehicle is increased (e.g., distributed electric-driven vehi- cles) or the operating conditions of vehicles are challenging. Inspired by recent significant successes taken by deep learning techniques in several areas [7], [8], researchers have begun to employ Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model for directly learning vehicle dynamical attributes. Being attributable to the exceptional non-linear fitting capabilities of DNN models, it achieves superior performance on vehicle dynamic modeling task than physics-based methods and gets rid of the limited human knowledge of vehicle systems [9], [10]. Such a solution learns DNN model in data-driven manner, so its accuracy and generalization ability may be challenged due to varying distributions of dynamics states between different conditions. And the performance of long-range state estimation is still limited due to its open-loop training strategy. As researchers have found in the ResNet [7], the DNN models are generally easier to learn residual functions with arXiv:2502.11800v1 [cs.RO] 17 Feb 2025"
