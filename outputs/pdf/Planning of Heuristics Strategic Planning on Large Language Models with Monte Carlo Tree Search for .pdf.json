  "abstract": "Heuristics have achieved great success in solv- ing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans re- quire too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language Mod- els (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to under- stand and generate content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel way to automatically optimize heuristics. There- fore, we propose Planning of Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self- reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algo- rithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing im- provement suggestions. Our method enables to it- eratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on the improvement sug- gestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Prob- lem (TSP) and the Flow Shop Scheduling Prob- lem (FSSP). The experimental results show that PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the signifi- cant improvements and the state-of-the-art per- formance of our proposed method in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs. 1. Introduction Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) commonly exist in diverse fields such as national defense(Xing et al., 2024), transportation(Wang & Tang, 2021), industry(Zhao et al., 2024), and communication(Witt et al., 2024). Their 1School of Artificial Intelligence, Anhui University, Hefei, An- hui, China 2Pengcheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

Heuristics are widely studied to solve COPs and achieve superior performance. The typical heuristics consist of guided local search (GLS) (Voudouris & Tsang, 1999), genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1973), and ant colony op- timization (ACO) (Dorigo et al., 1996). Usually, achieving satisfactory solutions with these methods requires human experts to manually adjust the heuristics for each specific problem. Although manually designed heuristics can be effective in many cases, this approach requires much time for experts to design, implement, and validate heuristics. In addition, for many complex COPs, this approach may result in errors. Consequently, Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has emerged as a promising alternative (Kumar et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022). The increasing availability of computa- tional resources further facilitates AHD. By reducing the reliance on specialized domain knowledge, AHD enables us to explore large design spaces, demonstrating substantial potential to address complex COPs. Given the fact that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing COPs, due to their broad knowledge understanding and powerful reasoning abilities (Yang et al., 2024). Furthermore, lever- aging their extensive training corpora, LLMs benefit from a wider search space compared to traditional evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms, leading to performance im- provements (Liu et al., 2024b; Ma, 2024). Recent research has successfully applied LLMs to heuristic generation and evolutionary search processes (Liu et al., 2024a; Ye et al., 2024; Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel AHD ap- proach called Planning of Heuristics (PoH). PoH reframes heuristic optimization as a strategic planning problem to manage the complexity of search spaces. Using strategic planning, PoH iteratively refines heuristics (represented as states) through insightful improvement proposals (actions). Starting with an initial heuristic (state), the system systemat- ically explores the heuristic search space using a tree-based search, prioritizing high-reward trajectories to efficiently navigate this extensive space. Using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning strategy, PoH can anticipate and 1 arXiv:2502.11422v1 [cs.AI] 17 Feb 2025"
