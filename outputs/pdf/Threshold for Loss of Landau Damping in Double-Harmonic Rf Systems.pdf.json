  "title": "Threshold for Loss of Landau Damping in Double-Harmonic Rf Systems.pdf",
  "abstract": "In the longitudinal plane, loss of Landau damping (LLD) occurs when a coherent mode of oscillation emerges from the incoherent band of the bunch synchrotron frequencies. This work extends the recent LLD studies to the relevant case of double-harmonic rf systems. Specifically, it is shown that in the bunch shortening mode (both rf systems in phase at the bunch position for a non-accelerating bucket), inductive impedance above transition energy results in a vanishing LLD threshold for a binominal particle distribution, similar to the single-harmonic rf case. In this configuration, refined analytical estimates of the synchrotron frequency distribution enabled the derivation of an analytical equation for the LLD threshold by introducing an upper cutoff frequency to the impedance. The LLD threshold is studied through the concept of van Kampen modes and takes into account the effect of the voltage ratio, as well as the relative phase between the two rf systems for an inductive impedance above transition energy (or capacitive below). The validity of the theoretical studies is supported by extensive beam measurements conducted under different bucket- filling conditions in two synchrotrons, the PS and the SPS at CERN. Beyond the analytical estimates, the observations are moreover compared with the semi-analytical code MELODY and macroparticle tracking simulations in BLonD. I. INTRODUCTION Landau damping [1] is a natural mechanism that pro- vides beam stability to a wide range of working high- intensity accelerators. Hence, acquiring a comprehensive understanding and making accurate predictions of the threshold for the loss of Landau damping (LLD) is es- sential for both single and multi-bunch instabilities in current as well as future projects. With reference to the longitudinal plane, Landau damping is established by means of the spread of synchrotron frequencies of individ- ual particles in a bunch, which is caused by the non-linear voltage of the rf system. In general, LLD occurs when the frequency of the coherent bunch oscillations emerges from the incoherent band of the bunch synchrotron fre- quencies. Different techniques are employed to enlarge the synchrotron frequency spread, including increasing the longitudinal emittance. However, the most effective method is introducing higher harmonic rf systems (these are often referred to as Landau rf systems). Several accel- erators, including the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Su- per Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN, operate with double-harmonic rf systems to increase the instability threshold [2\u20138] or manipulate the bunch shape. In double-harmonic rf, the particles experience a total voltage given by Vrf(\u03d5) = V0[sin(\u03d5 + \u03d5s0) + rV sin (rh\u03d5 + rh\u03d5s0 + \u03a62)] , (1) where V0, is the voltage magnitude of the main rf sys- tem, \u03d5s0 is the phase of the synchronous particle, and \u03d5 is the phase offset relative to the synchronous phase. The parameters rV and rh denote the rf systems volt- age and harmonic number ratios, while \u03a62 represents \u2217leandro.intelisano@cern.ch the relative phase between them. Two distinct opera- tional modes can be distinguished depending on the value of \u03a62. Bunch shortening mode (BSM) occurs when the rf systems are in phase at the bunch position for a non- accelerating bucket, leading to shorter bunches. On the other hand, when the rf systems are in counter-phase, one refers to the bunch lengthening mode (BLM). Figure 1 shows the synchrotron frequency distributions for differ- ent harmonic ratios, rh, in both configurations. Several methods have been developed to assess the LLD thresh- old, one of which is the Sacherer stability diagram derived from a general integral equation [9]. In this approach, co- herent modes are calculated assuming a linear rf field and neglecting the incoherent frequency spread. The LLD occurs when the coherent mode crosses the boundary of the stability diagram. Another method, similar to the Sacherer analytical criterion, obtains the LLD threshold from the integral form of the Lebedev equation [10] as shown in [11] assuming a constant reactive impedance. Hoffman and Pedersen proposed an alternative pro- cedure [12] to compute the frequency of a rigid-dipole mode, including synchrotron frequency spread in a single- harmonic rf system and elliptic particle distribution. Boine-Frankenheim, Shukla, and Chorniy [7, 8] extended the Hofmann-Pedersen approach to the case of multi- harmonic rf system. The Sacherer stability criterion and the Hoffman- Pedersen approach can overestimate the actual LLD threshold due to inherent approximations as observed in calculations [6] and confirmed in measurements [5]. Chin, Satoh, and Yokoya [13] contributed to a new de- scription of Landau damping, explaining it as the phase mixing of the van Kampen modes [14, 15]. The LLD oc- curs when any of these modes emerge beyond the bound- aries of the incoherent synchrotron frequencies band.
