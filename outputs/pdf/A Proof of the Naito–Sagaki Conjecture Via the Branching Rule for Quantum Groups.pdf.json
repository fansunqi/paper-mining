  "abstract": ". The Naito\u2013Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the re- striction of \ufb01nite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of GL2n(C) to Sp2n(C) amounts to the enumeration of certain \u201crational paths\u201d satisfying speci\ufb01c conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann\u2013Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito\u2013Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann\u2013Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for \u0131quantum groups of type AII2n\u22121. Here, note that \u0131quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized uni- versal enveloping algebra obtained by q-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were de\ufb01ned by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial opera- tions, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras. 1. Introduction The purpose of this paper is to give a new proof of the branching rule for the re- striction of irreducible highest weight representations of general linear Lie algebras to symplectic Lie algebras, conjectured by Naito and Sagaki in [NS05]. Let I be the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram of type Ar, and g the general linear Lie algebra of rank r. In Lie theory, it is a fundamental problem to describe how each irreducible highest weight g-module L(\u03bb) decomposes when we restrict the action of g to its certain subalebra bg, where \u03bb is a dominant weight in the weight lattice P of g. In [Lit94] and [Lit95], Littelmann answered this question in terms of \u201crational paths\u201d lying in the real form PR = R \u2297Z P of the dual space of the Cartan subalgebra of g when bg is a Levi subalgebra of g. Here, let us brie\ufb02y review Littelmann\u2019s theory of the path model. Throughout this paper, a piecewise-linear, continuous map \u03c0 : [0, 1]R \u2192PR is called a path if \u03c0(0) = 0 and \u03c0(1) \u2208P; the set of all paths lying in PR is denoted by P. For i \u2208I, Littelmann de\ufb01ned certain operators on P, called root operators, which arise from the action of the Chevalley generators of g. Let P(\u03bb) denote the set of all paths obtained by applying root operators to the straight-line path connecting the origin and a dominant integral weight \u03bb \u2208P. Littelmann discovered that the set P(\u03bb), equipped with the root operators, is 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. Primary 05E10; Secondary 17B10, 17B37.
