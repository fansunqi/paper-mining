  "abstract": "Neural signals related to movement can be measured from intracranial recordings and used in brain-machine interface devices (BMI) to restore physical function in impaired patients. In this study, we explore the use of more abstract neural signals related to economic value in a BMI context. Using data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders that can predict the monkey\u2019s choice in a value-based decision-making task. Out-of-sample performance was improved by augmenting the training set with synthesized data, showing the feasibility of using limited training data. We further demonstrate that we can predict the monkey\u2019s choice sooner using a neural forecasting module that is equipped with task-related information. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuroengineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals. Introduction Decoding neural signals is a primary focus of neuroengineering applications. By extracting the neural correlates of a particular cognitive process, neuroengineering systems like brain machine interfaces (BMIs) can help restore or augment that process. For example, BMI systems can partially restore motor functions by decoding movement-related signals from cortical motor areas, allowing users to control robotic limbs (Velliste et al. [2008],Oby et al. [2020],Shenoy et al. [2003]) or on-screen cursors (Irwin et al. [2017],Kim et al. [2008],Gilja et al. [2012],Jarosiewicz et al. [2015]),Sussillo et al. [2012],Fan et al. [2014]). Recent work has expanded on these ideas to decode neural correlates of sensory signals (Gao et al. [2014],Guenther et al. [2009],Hill et al. [2004],Jia et al. [2017],O\u2019Doherty et al. [2011],Heelan et al. [2019]). Other work in non- human primates has focused on invasive BMI applications for the prefrontal cortex to decode signals related to eye movements and spatial locations in a virtual maze (Johnston et al. [2023]). Despite these advances, very few studies have explored the use of abstract cognitive signals related to subjective mental contents (Card et al. [2024],Wairagkar et al. [2023],Chinchani et al. [2022],Even-Chen et al. [2017]) . By detecting signals that are related to a user\u2019s goals or beliefs, systems can be developed to aid higher cognitive functions. In this work, we seek to explore the development of BMI systems that can extract abstract neural signals encoding economic values. Economic value (also called utility) is the subjective perception of the benefit or harm associated with a given stimulus, outcome, or course of action. Values are typically learned through experience and depend on an individual\u2019s behavioral context, goals, and internal state. Neural representations of value form the foundation for goal-directed decision-making (Castegnetti et al. [2021], O\u2019Doherty [2011]). Thus, the ability to extract subjective value information from neural activity is an important step in decoding abstract mental contents such as goals and desires. The neural correlates of value have been extensively characterized in animal models including nonhuman primates (McGinty and Lupkin [2023],Sharma et al. [2024],Padoa-Schioppa and Assad [2006],Padoa-Schioppa and Conen [2017],Thorpe et al. [1983],Conen and Padoa-Schioppa [2015],Kimmel et al. [2020],Padoa-Schioppa [2013],McGinty et al. [2016],Kennerley et al. [2009],Yamada et al. [2018],Rich and Wallis [2016],Padoa-Schioppa and Assad [2006],Tremblay and Schultz 1 arXiv:2502.12092v1 [q-bio.NC] 17 Feb 2025"
