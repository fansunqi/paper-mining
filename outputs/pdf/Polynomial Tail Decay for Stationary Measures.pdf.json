Our result applies for example to self-similar or self-a\ufb03ne measures. Contents 1. Introduction 1 2. Proof of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 4 3. Further Remarks 7 References 8 1. Introduction Let X be a complete metric space. For a continuous map g : X \u2192X denote by \u03c1(g) the Lipschitz constant of g de\ufb01ned as \u03c1(g) = min{\u03c1 > 0 : d(gx, gy) \u2264\u03c1 \u00b7 d(x, y) for all x, y \u2208X}, where we use throughout this paper the notation gx = g(x) for all x \u2208X. Consider the semi-group L(X) = {g : X \u2192X : \u03c1(g) < \u221e} of Lipschitz maps. For a probability measure \u00b5 on L(X) we de\ufb01ne the contraction ratio of \u00b5 as \u03c7\u00b5 = Eg\u223c\u00b5[log \u03c1(g)] whenever it exists. Given a further probability measure \u03bd on X the convolution \u00b5 \u2217\u03bd is the measure uniquely determined by satisfying (\u00b5 \u2217\u03bd)(f) = Z Z f(gx) d\u00b5(g)d\u03bd(x) for all continuous compactly supported functions f : X \u2192R. The main result of this note is the following. We refer to the end of the intro- duction for the asymptotic notation used. Theorem 1.1. Let X be a complete metric space and let \u00b5 be a \ufb01nitely supported probability measure on L(X) with \u03c7\u00b5 < 0. Then there exists a unique probability measure \u03bd on X such that \u00b5 \u2217\u03bd = \u03bd. Moreover, there is \u03b1 = \u03b1(\u00b5) > 0 such that for all x \u2208X and R > 0, \u03bd({y \u2208X : d(x, y) \u2265R}) \u226a\u00b5,x R\u2212\u03b1, (1.1) where the implied constant depends on \u00b5 and x. 1"
