Angelo, via Cinthia, I-80126 Napoli, Italy We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function also fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry, with stroboscopic projective measurements. I. INTRODUCTION Entanglement [1, 2] is a fundamental concept in quan- tum mechanics that has been widely exploited to charac- terize many-body quantum systems. It can spotlight the presence of quantum phase transitions [3] and the exis- tence of topological boundary modes [4\u20137], or can distin- guish the unitary dynamics of thermalizing, integrable, and many-body localized quantum systems [8\u201317]. More- over, in short-range systems undergoing a unitary evolu- tion, it asymptotically attains a value that scales propor- tionally with the system size (volume law). Recently, attention has shifted to understanding the effects of an external monitoring on the asymptotic be- havior of the entanglement. Intuitively, in the presence of projective measurements, the system collapses onto an eigenstate of the measurement operator and the entan- glement remains constant with the system size (area law, in one-dimensional systems). However this scenario may change when undergoing both a measurement processes and a Hamiltonian evolution. Indeed, the interplay be- tween the entangling effect of the Hamiltonian dynamics and the disentangling role of measurements leads to a variety of dynamical phases, characterized by peculiar entanglement behaviors. This gives rise to the entangle- ment transitions that have been identified in a variety of models, spanning from quantum circuits [18\u201338], to inte- grable or solvable [24, 39\u201366] and nonintegrable [67\u201374] Hamiltonian systems. Focusing on free-fermion systems in the presence of local weak measurements, a crossover from a phase in which the asymptotic bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) grows logarithmically with the system size to a phase in which it remains constant has been observed. The numerical evidence for a transition has been analyt- ically confirmed in the case of a Z2 symmetry [48] and challenged for a U(1) symmetry [49], suggesting that the logarithmic increase ceases for a size that is exponentially large in the inverse coupling. In this same context, when considering nonlocal weak measurements (e.g., power- law decaying measurement operators) or particular lat- tice geometries, one numerically observes transitions be- tween three distinct situations: A volume-law, an inter- mediate subvolume-law, and an area-law entanglement phase [75, 76]. This is similar to what happens when the dynamics is only induced by random measurements of nonlocal strings [77\u201379]. Here we look at this kind of transitions from a different unifying perspective, considering a variety of monitored fermionic systems (including the ones mentioned above) coupled to the environment through a quantum-state- diffusion monitoring process. We find that, in all cases, the asymptotic stationary value of the bipartite EE de- pends on the system size L in a way that is remarkably well fitted, for all the sizes we study, by the function f(L) = A L 1 + C Lb , (A, C, b \u22650). (1) This behaves linearly at small L and becomes a power law at large sizes, suggesting that the monitored system keeps being still in some way correlated, with a power- law increasing correlation length. Even though we lack a theoretical interpretation, we believe that this obser- vation can contribute in the direction of a well stated description of the entanglement transitions. The paper is divided in three parts. We first focus on integrable monitored fermionic models: (i) the tight- binding chain with onsite dephasing, (ii) the Kitaev chain arXiv:2502.09401v1 [quant-ph] 13 Feb 2025"
