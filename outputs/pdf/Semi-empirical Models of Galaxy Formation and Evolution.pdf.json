  "abstract": "We provide a review on semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution. In Section 1 we present a brief census of the three main modeling approaches to galaxy evolution, namely hydrodynamical simulations, semi-analytic models, and semi-empirical models (SEMs). In Section 2 we focus on SEMs in their different flavors, i.e. interpretative, descriptive and hybrid, discussing the peculiarities and highlighting virtues and shortcomings for each of these variants. In Section 3 we dissect a simple and recent hybrid SEM from our team to highlight some technical aspects. In Section 4 we offer some outlook on the prospective developments of SEMs. In Section 5 we provide a short summary of this review. Key points \u2022 Semi empirical models (SEM) are effective, data-driven, easily expandable and computationally low-cost approaches to galaxy evolution, complementary to (semi-)analytic models and numerical simulations. \u2022 Descriptive SEMs produce realistic snapshots of the Universe at a given cosmic time. Interpretative SEMs serve to test specific hypotheses or consistency among different datasets. Hybrid SEMs feature elements partly in line with an interpretative and partly with a descriptive viewpoint. \u2022 SEMs are being exploited to address open issues in galaxy evolution like galaxy quenching mechanisms and the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. A strong synergy of SEMs with data science techniques could also be foreseen in the near future. 1 Introduction: the triumvirate of galaxy formation models (SIMs, SAMs, and SEMs) Acquiring a comprehensive picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological context is one of the main challenges in modern astrophysics (see Mo et al. 2010; Silk and Mamon 2012; Maiolino and Mannucci 2019; Cimatti et al. 2020). Whilst a well-defined standard model exists in particle physics, there is no equivalent in the realm of extragalactic astrophysics, where major unknowns still limit our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Leading theories suggest that galaxies form from the condensation and cooling of pristine gas within virialized dark matter (DM) structures called halos. Ironically, the evolution of such an \u2018obscure\u2019 DM component is somewhat simpler and better understood than the \u2018luminous\u2019 baryonic one, since allegedly the only force at play among DM particles is (Newtonian) gravity. Cosmological N\u2212body simulations have been able to precisely delineate the formation and evolution of DM halos and to extensively characterize their statistical properties. In contrast, the physics regulating baryons is intrinsically complex, since it involves many physical processes occurring on vastly different spatial, time, and energy scales. 1"
