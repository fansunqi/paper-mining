The X(3872) is determined to be a bound state with a significance of 6\u03c3, and its pole is located at EX= \u0000\u221253+ 9 \u221224 \u2212i 34+ 2 \u221212 \u0001 keV, relative to the nominal D0 \u00afD\u22170 threshold. Moreover, we confirm the presence of an isovector partner state, Wc1. It is found as a virtual state at (1.6+0.7 \u22120.9 +i 1.4+0.3 \u22120.6) MeV relative to the D+D\u2217\u2212threshold on an unphysical Riemann sheet, strongly supporting a molecular nature of both X(3872) and Wc1. As a highly non-trivial prediction we show that the Wc1 leads to nontrivial lineshapes in B0 \u2192K0X(3872) \u2192K0D0 \u00afD0\u03c00 and K0J/\u03c8\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u2014thus the scheme presented here can be tested further by improved measurements. INTRODUCTION Since over 20 years the study of exotic hadronic states is one of the central themes in hadron physics. These states, which lie beyond the conventional quark model for quark-antiquark mesons and three-quark baryons, offer a unique opportunity to understand the inner workings of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), since different multi- quark configurations mean different realizations of con- finement: In molecular states, confinement happens in the smallest possible subsystems, typically conventional hadrons, which are then bound together via a residual strong force, analogously to the binding of nucleons in nuclei; however, in the compact tetraquark picture, con- finement is the binding force among all possible quark- (anti)quark pairs. The new quest was initiated by the discovery of X(3872) in B decays [1], also denoted as \u03c7c1(3872) [2] after the quantum numbers were fixed to JP C = 1++ [3, 4]. The state was shortly after confirmed in various other experiments, and a growing family of exotic hadron candidates has since been reported exper- imentally and investigated theoretically; see Refs. [5\u201314] for recent reviews. The X(3872) continues to serve as a benchmark for testing theoretical frameworks and con- straining models of hadronic structure. Despite the large number of experimental and theo- retical studies, several aspects of X(3872) remain poorly understood. Although the X(3872) mass has been mea- sured with high precision\u20143871.64(6) MeV according to the 2024 issue of the Review of Particle Physics [2]\u2014it re- mains unclear whether it lies above or below the D0 \u00afD\u22170 threshold, as the uncertainty encompasses this bound- ary. Notably, the mass and width of X(3872) listed in Ref. [2] are from averaging values extracted using the Breit-Wigner parameterization (e.g., in Refs. [15\u201317]), which is not appropriate for describing X(3872) line- shape near the D0 \u00afD\u22170 threshold, a channel to which X(3872) couples strongly in S-wave. While the Flatt\u00b4e parameterization of Ref. [18] employed in Refs. [19, 20] offers improvement by including the nonanalyticity at the D0 \u00afD\u22170 threshold, it neglects the three-body effects of the D \u00afD\u03c0 system, as discussed in Refs. [21\u201325] for similar systems, which could hinder a precise determination of the X(3872) properties. It also has the drawback that it assumes the coupled-channel potential matrix to be non-invertible and thus might not be sufficiently gen- eral [26\u201331]. Furthermore, another potentially crucial factor is missing in all existing analyses: In Ref. [25], it was shown using chiral effective field theory that data call for the existence of an isovector partner of X(3872), there and here called Wc1\u2014according to the naming scheme in Ref. [2] it should be Tc\u00afc1(3882) due to its quantum num- bers IG(JP C) = 1\u2212(1++).1 The charged members of the same multiplet appear as virtual states in (D \u00afD\u2217)\u00b1 scat- tering. Their existence is supported by a recent lattice QCD calculation [32]. The neutral W 0 c1 manifests itself as a mild cusp at the D+D\u2217\u2212threshold whose strength is expected to be much weaker than the peak around the D0 \u00afD\u22170 threshold [25], which, however, distorts the line- shape and contaminates the signal of X(3872). Therefore, in order to extract the X(3872) (and Wc1) properties reliably, it is necessary to reanalyze the data in 1 Not to be confused with the Tc\u00afc1(3900), also known as Zc(3900), with quantum numbers 1+(1+\u2212). arXiv:2502.04458v1 [hep-ph] 6 Feb 2025"
