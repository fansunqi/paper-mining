  "abstract": "Model uncertainties in the nonlinear structure growth limit current probes of cosmological parameters. To shed more light on the physics of nonlinear scales, we reconstruct the finely binned three-dimensional power-spectrum from lensing data of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), relying solely on the background cosmology, source redshift distributions, and the intrinsic alignment (IA) amplitude of sources (and their uncertainties). The adopted Tikhonov regularisation stabilises the deprojection, enabling a Bayesian reconstruc- tion in separate z-bins. Following a detailed description of the algorithm and performance tests with mock data, we present our results for the power spectrum as relative deviations from a \u039bCDM reference spectrum that includes only structure growth by cold dark matter. Averaged over the full range z \u22721, a Planck-consistent reference then requires a significant suppression on nonlinear scales, k = 0.05\u201310 h Mpc\u22121, of up to 20%\u201330% to match KiDS-1000 (68% credible interval, CI, throughout). Conversely, a reference with a lower S 8 \u22480.73 avoids suppression and matches the KiDS-1000 spectrum within a 20% tolerance. When resolved into three z- bins, however, and regardless of the reference, we detect structure growth only between z \u22480.4\u20130.13, but not between z \u22480.7\u20130.4. This could indicate spurious systematic errors in KiDS-1000, inaccuracies in the intrinsic alignment (IA) model, or potentially a non-standard cosmological model with delayed structure growth. In the near future, analysing data from stage-IV surveys with our algorithm promises a substantially more precise reconstruction of the power spectrum.

Introduction In contrast to the continuous background expansion of the Uni- verse, the structure growth in the matter density field is less cer- tain, with theoretical uncertainties varying by 10% or more in the nonlinear regime through their dependence on baryon-galaxy feedback, possible deviations from a purely cold, stable, and interaction-free dark-matter, or, perhaps, modifications in the standard model of gravity (e.g., Lagu\u00eb et al. 2024; Bucko et al. 2024; Mauland et al. 2024; Ferreira et al. 2024; Salcido et al. 2023; Schneider et al. 2022; Harnois-D\u00e9raps et al. 2015; Smith & Markovic 2011; Jing et al. 2006, and references therein). Cur- rently the theory uncertainties are limiting studies of cosmologi- cal parameters because they often rely on measures of the cosmic structure, such as the matter power spectrum, P\u03b4(k, z), at differ- ent redshift, z =: 1/a \u22121, and spatial (comoving) wave number, k (e.g., Pranjal R. et al. 2024; Garc\u00b4ia-Garc\u00b4ia et al. 2024; Secco et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023; Asgari et al. 2021; Heymans et al. 2013). To shed more light on the physics imprinted on nonlinear scales, direct measurements of a model-free P\u03b4(k, z) with a min- imum of assumptions promise to be a valuable model test. That this is already feasible for z \u22721 and 10\u22122 \u2272k/(h Mpc\u22121) \u227210 with stage-III galaxy surveys when exploiting the weak gravi- tational lensing effect, such as with KiDS-1000 (Kuijken et al. 2019, 2015), is shown in this work. This foreshadows exciting applications to future lensing data, such as those by Euclid (Eu- clid Collaboration: Mellier et al. 2024), the Vera C. Rubin Ob- \u22c6e-mail: psimon@astro.uni-bonn.de servatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration et al. 2018), or the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Spergel et al. 2015). The coherent distortion of distant galaxy images, just sources hereafter, by the weak shearing of light bundles passing through intervening foreground structure probes the matter power spec- trum (e.g., for a review: Kilbinger 2015, Schneider 2006, Bartel- mann & Schneider 2001). More specifically, and putting neg- ligible higher-order corrections aside (Hilbert et al. 2009), the second-order correlations, \u03be\u00b1(\u03b8), at lag \u03b8 in the cosmic shear field are simply a linear projection of P\u03b4(k, z) throughout the look- back light cone up to the distance of the sources (Preston et al. 2024; Mezzetti et al. 2012; Simon 2012; Bacon et al. 2005; Pen et al. 2003; Tegmark & Zaldarriaga 2002; Seljak 1998). There- fore, by using \u03be(i j) \u00b1 (\u03b8) between tomographic bins, i and j, for different characteristic distances of sources, the correlation data can be deprojected to recover, within limitations, the original P\u03b4(k, z). More conveniently, as in Simon (2012, S12), we focus on a transfer function, f\u03b4(k, z) = P\u03b4(k, z)/Pfid \u03b4 (k, z), with respect to a reference model, Pfid \u03b4 (k, z), to highlight deviations from the presumed reference inside an average z-bin. For this reference, we choose a purely cold dark-matter (CDM) model to probe for deviations, f\u03b4(k, z) , 1, that may hint at missing physics in a ba- sic, well-understood dark-matter scenario or at unidentified sys- tematic errors in the data. But, at the end of the day, the kind of reference is a deliberate choice. Required for the deprojection, on the other hand, is the knowledge of the projection (lensing) kernel and the inclusion Article number, page 1 of 22 arXiv:2502.04449v1 [astro-ph.CO] 6 Feb 2025"
