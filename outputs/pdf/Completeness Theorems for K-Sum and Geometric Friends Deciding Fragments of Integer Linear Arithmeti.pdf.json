  "abstract": "In the last three decades, the k-SUM hypothesis has emerged as a satisfying explanation of long- standing time barriers for a variety of algorithmic problems. Yet to this day, the literature knows of only few proven consequences of a refutation of this hypothesis. Taking a descriptive complexity viewpoint, we ask: What is the largest logically defined class of problems captured by the k-SUM problem? To this end, we introduce a class FOPZ of problems corresponding to deciding sentences in Presburger arithmetic/linear integer arithmetic over finite subsets of integers. We establish two large fragments for which the k-SUM problem is complete under fine-grained reductions: 1. The k-SUM problem is complete for deciding the sentences with k existential quantifiers. 2. The 3-SUM problem is complete for all 3-quantifier sentences of FOPZ expressible using at most 3 linear inequalities. Specifically, a faster-than-n\u2308k/2\u2309\u00b1o(1) algorithm for k-SUM (or faster-than-n2\u00b1o(1) algorithm for 3- SUM, respectively) directly translate to polynomial speedups of a general algorithm for all sentences in the respective fragment. Observing a barrier for proving completeness of 3-SUM for the entire class FOPZ, we turn to the question which other \u2013 seemingly more general \u2013 problems are complete for FOPZ. In this direction, we establish FOPZ-completeness of the problem pair of Pareto Sum Verification and Hausdorff Distance under n Translations under the L\u221e/L1 norm in Zd. In particular, our results invite to investigate Pareto Sum Verification as a high-dimensional generalization of 3-SUM. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192Computational complexity and cryp- tography \u2192Complexity theory and logic Keywords and phrases fine-grained complexity theory, descriptive complexity, presburger arith- metic, completeness results, k-SUM Funding This research is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Re- search Foundation) - 462679611.

If a given problem A admits an algorithm running in n2+o(1) time, and it is known that A cannot be solved in time O(n2\u2212\u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0, then clearly the n2+o(1) algorithm has optimal runtime, up to subpolynomial factors. This question can be asked more generally for any k \u22651 and time nk\u00b1o(1). To this day, the theoretical computer science community is far from able to resolve this question unconditionally. However, a surge of results over recent years uses conditional lower bounds based on plausible hardness assumptions to shed some light on why some problems seemingly arXiv:2502.04581v1 [cs.CC] 7 Feb 2025"
