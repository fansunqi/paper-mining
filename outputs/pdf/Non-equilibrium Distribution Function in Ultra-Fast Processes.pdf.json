  "abstract": "A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient pro- cesses is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the con- ditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identi\ufb01ed. A rigorous threshold between \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi- equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for \ufb01nite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expres- sion for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium. 1"
