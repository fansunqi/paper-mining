Zhang4 1Beijing Normal University at Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519087, China 2Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, Beijing 100094, China 3Beijing Honest Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100083, China 4China Nuclear Power Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, 518000, China (Dated: February 6, 2025) Electric charge conservation (ECC) is typically taken as an axiom in the standard model. Search- ing for small violations with high-performance experiments could lead us to new physics. In this work, we tested \u201cinvisible\u201d electric charge nonconservation (ECNC) events with 1.16 ton\u00b7year elec- tron recoil data from the XENON-nT experiment. There was no statistically significant signal, and the ECNC limit was updated to \u03c4(e\u2212\u2192\u03bde + \u00af\u03bde + \u03bde) > 4.34 \u00d7 1027 yr. This work increases the limit by two orders of magnitude and shows that dark matter direct detection experiments have great potential for further ECC testing. Introduction. In 1957, Wu et al. reported that par- ity is not conserved in weak interactions in \u03b2 decay ex- periments [1]. In 1964, Christenson et al. discovered the violation of charge-parity invariance [2]. These find- ings greatly shocked the community. Since then, new ex- periments have been conducted to examine fundamental laws, such as electric charge conservation (ECC). ECC arises from the global U(1) symmetry gauge in- variance of the electric field [3]. The experimental evi- dence for ECC is that a photon has an extremely small upper limit on its rest mass [4]. However, electric charge nonconservation (ECNC) is allowed in some theoretical frameworks beyond the standard model [5\u20138]. If ECNC is confirmed, then new physics will emerge. However, to date, no definite signal of ECNC has been found. In previous tests of ECC, the limits on the mean lifetime \u03c4 have gradually become increasingly stringent. The most recent result of \u03c4(e\u2212\u2192\u03bde + \u00af\u03bde + \u03bde) > 2.83 \u00d7 1025 yr was from the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR with a 37.5 kg yr exposure [9]. The MAJORANA experiment pursues neutrinoless double-beta decay via a high-purity germanium (HPGe) array with an ultralow background [10]. Dark matter di- rect detection experiments such as XENON [11\u201313] and PandaX [14] also have an ultralow background, can carry out the search for the other ultrarare physical events while searching for dark matter [13]. The event rate is approximately 0.06 Count/keV/kg/day, which is 21900 Count/keV/ton/yr at 5 keV, approximately 8000 Count/keV/ton/yr at 11 keV in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR ex- periment [9], and approximately 12 Count/keV/ton/yr at 5 keV in the XENON-nT experiment [15]. HPGe detector usually has an excellent energy resolution of approximately 80 eV at 5 keV. Although the energy resolution of XENON-nT (approximately 700 eV at 5 keV) can not match for that of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, XENON-nT has a lower event rate, which allows it to obtain better results. In this work, we tested the ECC with 1.16 ton\u00b7year exposure data from the XENON-nT experiment and updated the most stringent limit. Expected signal ECNC occurs when an electron decays into neutral particles. There are two main types of experiments on ECNC in electron decay: I. \u201cvisible\u201d, e\u2212\u2192\u03bde + \u03b3. This process splits the en- ergy of the electrons equally, giving them 256 keV each. The photon can be picked up by the detector, so this process is \u201cvisible\u201d. BOREXINO is a typical example of this type of experiment [16, 17]. II. \u201cinvisible\u201d, e\u2212\u2192\u03bde + \u00af\u03bde + \u03bde, the most favorable mode [18]. This process produces neutrinos instead of photons, so it is called \u201cinvisible\u201d decay of the electron. When one of the inner electrons of an atom is lost by in- visible decay, the outer electron fills the electron vacancy, and X-rays are be emitted.The atomic levels of xenon are listed in Table I. For example, when an electron in the K shell undergoes invisible decay in a Xe atom, X-rays of 34.6 keV are detected. In this work, we choose this most favorable mode to test ECC and search for ECNC.
