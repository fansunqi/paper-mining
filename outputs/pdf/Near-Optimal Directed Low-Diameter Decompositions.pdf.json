  "title": "Near-Optimal Directed Low-Diameter Decompositions.pdf",
  "abstract": "Low Diameter Decompositions (LDDs) are invaluable tools in the design of com- binatorial graph algorithms. While historically they have been applied mainly to undirected graphs, in the recent breakthrough for the negative-length Single Source Shortest Path problem, Bernstein, Nanongkai, and Wul\ufb00-Nilsen [FOCS \u201922] ex- tended the use of LDDs to directed graphs for the \ufb01rst time. Speci\ufb01cally, their LDD deletes each edge with probability at most O( 1 D \u00b7 log2 n), while ensuring that each strongly connected component in the remaining graph has a (weak) diameter of at most D. In this work, we make further advancements in the study of directed LDDs. We reveal a natural and intuitive (in hindsight) connection to Expander Decomposi- tions, and leveraging this connection along with additional techniques, we establish the existence of an LDD with an edge-cutting probability of O( 1 D \u00b7 log n log log n). This improves the previous bound by nearly a logarithmic factor and closely ap- proaches the lower bound of \u2126( 1 D \u00b7 log n). With signi\ufb01cantly more technical e\ufb00ort, we also develop two e\ufb03cient algorithms for computing our LDDs: a deterministic algorithm that runs in time eO(m poly(D)) and a randomized algorithm that runs in near-linear time eO(m). We believe that our work provides a solid conceptual and technical foundation for future research relying on directed LDDs, which will undoubtedly follow soon. aThis work is part of the project TIPEA that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 850979). bPartially funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria\u2019s support for INSAIT as part of the Bulgarian National Roadmap for Research Infrastructure. cPartially funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria\u2019s support for INSAIT as part of the Bulgarian National Roadmap for Research Infrastructure and through the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ERC grant agreement 949272). dSupported by the Research Council of Finland (grant 334238), The Finnish Foundation for Tech- nology Promotion and The Nokia Foundation"
