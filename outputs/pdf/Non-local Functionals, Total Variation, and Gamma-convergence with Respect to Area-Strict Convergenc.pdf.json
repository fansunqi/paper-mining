  "abstract": "We study a class of non-local functionals that was introduced by Brezis\u2013Seeger\u2013Van Schaftingen\u2013Yung [5], and can be used to characterize the total variation of functions. We establish the \u0393-limit of these functionals with respect to area-strict convergence. 1 Introduction Let n \u2208N and let \u03b3 \u2208R, and de\ufb01ne the measure \u03bd\u03b3(A) := \u00a8 A |x \u2212y|\u03b3\u2212n dy dx, A \u2282Rn \u00d7 Rn. Let \u2126\u2282Rn be open. For a measurable function u: \u2126\u2192R, let E\u03b3,\u03bb(u, \u2126) := \b (x, y) \u2208\u2126\u00d7 \u2126: |u(x) \u2212u(y)| > \u03bb|x \u2212y|1+\u03b3 , \u03bb \u2208(0, \u221e), and then de\ufb01ne the functional F\u03b3,\u03bb (u, \u2126) := \u03bb\u03bd\u03b3(E\u03b3,\u03bb(u, \u2126)). This was studied in the case \u03b3 = n in [6, 14], and then more generally for \u03b3 \u2208R by Brezis\u2013Seeger\u2013Van Schaftingen\u2013Yung in [4, 5]. Denoting x = (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208Rn, let Cn := \u02c6 Sn\u22121 |x1| dHn\u22121(x), where Hn\u22121 is the (n \u22121)-dimensional Hausdor\ufb00measure, and Sn\u22121 is the unit sphere. We will always consider \u03b3 > 0. In response to a question posed in [4], Picenni [13] showed that for a special function of bounded variation u \u2208SBV(Rn) \u2282BV(Rn), we have lim \u03bb\u2192\u221eF\u03b3,\u03bb(u, Rn) = Cn \u03b3 |Dau|(Rn) + Cn \u03b3 + 1|Dju|(Rn).
