  "abstract": "\u2014Accurate reliability modeling for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and hyper-reliable low latency communication (HRLLC) networks is challenging due to the complex interactions between network layers required to meet stringent requirements. In this paper, we propose such a model. We consider the acknowledged mode of the radio link control (RLC) layer, utilizing separate buffers for transmissions and re- transmissions, along with the behavior of physical channels. Our approach leverages the effective capacity (EC) framework, which quanti\ufb01es the maximum constant arrival rate a time-varying wireless channel can support while meeting statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints. We derive a reliability model that incorporates delay violations, various latency components, and multiple transmission attempts. Our method identi\ufb01es optimal operating conditions that satisfy URLLC/HRLLC constraints while maintaining near-optimal EC, ensuring the system can handle peak traf\ufb01c with a guaranteed QoS. Our model reveals critical trade-offs between EC and reliability across various use cases, providing guidance for URLLC/HRLLC network design for service providers and system designers.

INTRODUCTION Beyond-5G/6G networks are expected to support a wide variety of applications in different verticals by offering diverse services, including URLLC/HRLLC [1]. These services are essential for emerging applications that demand high reli- ability and deterministic wireless data transmissions, such as industrial automation, intelligent transportation systems, holographic telepresence, and tele-surgery [2]. Achieving ex- treme reliability with ultra-low latency, presents signi\ufb01cant challenges across multiple layers of the mobile network stack and calls for a highly optimised network design, accounting for the interactions between them [3]. Physical channels are crucial in enabling mission-critical ap- plications since they deal with several environment-dependent factors such as propagation losses, multi-path and fading ef- fects [4]. The medium access control (MAC) layer challenges include real-time resource allocations, speci\ufb01cally, scheduling packets from multiple radio link control (RLC) queues based on channel conditions, which can introduce variability in latency [5]. Addressing these challenges requires a reliability model that accounts for multi-layer interactions within the mobile network stack. We propose such a model that uni\ufb01es the 5G link (RLC and MAC) and physical (PHY) layers, to aid URLLC network design for mission-critical applications. In [6], the authors provide an overview of statistical tools, including tail distribution approximations, queuing and ex- treme value theory, and data-driven approaches highlight- ing their relevance to URLLC network design. One such statistical tool is the effective capacity (EC) [7], the dual of effective bandwidth [8], which quanti\ufb01es the maximum constant arrival rate a communication system can support while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements. The authors in [9] optimize EC by jointly adapting power and datarate while satisfying packet error rate (PER) and delay constraints. However, they do not account for automatic repeat request (ARQ) or hybrid ARQ (HARQ) mechanisms. In con- trast, [10] incorporates HARQ in the EC model, revealing that retransmission overhead at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can reduce EC, especially when using adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). The authors in [11] introduce mission effective capacity (MEC) and mission reliability (MR) metrics speci\ufb01cally for URLLC in industrial internet of things (IIoT), providing closed-form expressions for MR and mean time to \ufb01rst failure (MTTFF) utilizing the EC framework. [12] utilizes EC to analyze delay-sensitive systems and propose joint data rate and power allocation schemes that maximize EC. However, existing works focus on models that consider only the unacknowledged mode (UM) of the RLC layer. This is a signi\ufb01cant limitation because UM does not support ARQ retransmissions, whereas acknowledged mode (AM) allows feedback-based retransmissions, which are critical to meet strict reliability requirements. Existing reliability models do not account for separate physical channels for control and user plane information while accounting for uni\ufb01ed link and physical layer characteristics in the reliability model. This is important since control plane information uses more robust modulation and coding schemes, resulting in Correct decoding of downlink control information (DCI) that leads to accurate decoding of user plane information. The major contributions of this paper are: 1) We extend the EC framework to a dual-buffer 5G RLC AM, deriving EC formulations for transmission (TX) and retransmission (RETX) buffers. 2) We develop a reliability framework that considers mul- tiple transmission attempts, both user and control plane transmissions while accounting for deterministic and stochastic delays. \u00a9 2025 IEEE.
