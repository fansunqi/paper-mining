  "abstract": "We construct the M5-brane limit of eleven-dimensional supergravity. The resulting action is invariant under Galilean boosts and has a lo- cal scale symmetry. We also consider the limit of the equations of motion where we recover a Poisson-like equation arising from an M5- brane source but which does not follow from the non-relativistic action. We argue that the resulting theory describes gravitational \ufb02uctuations around a stack of M5-branes, represented by a trivial Minkowskian spacetime, but where the number of M5-branes is determined by the \ufb02ux of a Lagrange multiplier \ufb01eld. 1E-mail address: e.a.bergshoeff@rug.nl 2E-mail address: neil.lambert@kcl.ac.uk 3E-mail address: joseph.m.smith@kcl.ac.uk"
