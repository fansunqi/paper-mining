  "abstract": "\u2014Diabetes mellitus is a global health crisis char- acterized by poor blood sugar regulation, impacting millions of people worldwide and leading to severe complications and mortality. Although Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) has a lower number of cases compared to other forms of diabetes, it is often diagnosed at a young age and requires lifelong exogenous insulin administration. In this paper, we focus on understanding the interaction of insulin and glucose molecules within the subcuta- neous layer, which is crucial for blood sugar control in T1DM patients. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose a comprehensive model to characterize the insulin-glucose system within the subcutaneous layer, incorporating a multicellular molecular communication system. We then divide the T1DM system into insulin and glucose subsystems and derive the end-to-end expression for insulin-glucose interaction in the subcutaneous layer. We further validate the insulin-glucose interaction analysis with an agent- based simulator. As effectively managing postprandial glucose levels is crucial for individuals with T1DM to safeguard their overall health and avert short-term and long-term complications, we also derive the optimal insulin administration time based on the derived glucose response via the Lagrange multiplier and gradient descent ascent method. This allows us to explore the impact of different types of insulin and dietary management on blood sugar levels. Simulation results con\ufb01rm the correctness of our proposed model and the effectiveness of our optimized effective time window for injecting insulin in individuals with T1DM.

INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus is a chronic medical condition character- ized by elevated blood sugar levels due to disrupted regulation [1]. This disruption in glucose regulation can lead to severe complications, including cardiovascular issues, nerve damage, kidney failure, and other debilitating conditions, impacting both individual well-being and global healthcare systems.

This paper has been accepted in part for the 2025 International Conference on Communications, June 2025. leading to 6.7 million deaths in that year [2]. There are two types of diabetes: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) which arises from an autoimmune attack on insulin-producing cells [3], and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) which results from insulin resistance and reduced insulin production [4]. Although T1DM patients comprise only 8\u223c10% of the cases, the distinct nature of T1DM, the fact that it is often diagnosed in young people, and the need for lifelong insulin therapy underscore the need for a comprehensive understanding and dedicated research to manage this complex disease. Various treatments and interventions are available for di- abetes management to regulate blood sugar levels and mit- igate associated complications [5], [6]. Lifestyle modi\ufb01ca- tions, including diet and exercise, are the initial and common recommendations in the early stages of T2DM, promoting healthy habits to manage blood sugar effectively [7], [8]. When T2DM progresses to the stage where lifestyle changes become ineffective, antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin and sulfonylureas, are frequently employed to improve insulin sen- sitivity and modulate glucose homeostasis by manipulating the metabolic system and its processes [9], [10]. However, lifestyle modi\ufb01cations and antidiabetic drugs are inadequate for T1DM as the body is unable to produce insulin and therapies aimed at modifying insulin sensitivity are ineffective. In such a case, the use of exogenous insulin by injection emerges as a crucial therapeutic choice for patients with T1DM [11], due to its ability to directly supplement de\ufb01cient endogenous insulin production and maintain optimal blood sugar levels. Despite its effectiveness in diabetes therapy, excessive use of exogenous insulin can lead to insulin resistance and various side effects, e.g., weight gain, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and breathing dif\ufb01culties [12], [13]. Thus, optimizing the timing of insulin injections to ensure administration at the most effective time and reduce the frequency of injections requires further study. To optimize insulin injection for effective drug adminis- tration, the monitoring of blood sugar levels over time is essential. Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) systems have been developed to aid diabetic care by measuring the blood sugar level in real-time replacing the traditional \ufb01nger-prick blood sample method [14]. When CGM is combined with an insulin pump, it can dynamically adjust insulin dosage concentration and timing to allow customized care tailored for the individual needs of patients [15]. To effectively adapt insulin injection, a mathematical model that can capture the physiological process of glucose and insulin interaction is needed."
