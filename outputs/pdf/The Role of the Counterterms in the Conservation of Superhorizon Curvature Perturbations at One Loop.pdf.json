  "abstract": "Miller III Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N. Charles Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21218, USA (Dated: February 18, 2025) Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge. I. INTRODUCTION Cosmological perturbations serve as a valuable probe of the early Universe. They were generated in the early Universe and have been observed through the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large-scale structure. The amplitude of these perturbations is of- ten characterized using curvature perturbations, as they are expected to remain constant (or conserved) once they exit the horizon in single-field inflation models [1\u20136]. However, Ref. [7] recently claimed that, if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period during the infla- tion, the superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level even in single-field mod- els.1 Specifically, the claim can be summarized as follows: Suppose the USR period occurs only within \u03c4i < \u03c4 < \u03c4e, where \u03c4 is the comoving time, while the other periods are in the slow-roll (SR) phase. Then, the one-loop curvature power spectrum is given by lim q\u21920 P1-loop \u03b6 (q) = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 0 (\u03c4 < \u03c4i) c P\u03b6,tr(q) \u02c6 kIR d ln k P\u03b6,tr(k) (\u03c4 > \u03c4e) , (1) where P\u03b6,tr is the tree-level power spectrum, c is inde- pendent of q, and kIR is some IR cutoff (kIR \u226bq). The claim of Ref. [7] is that c can be \u22731 if a sharp transition between the USR and the SR is considered. This claim has sparked controversy [9\u201335]. Some pa- pers accept that c can be nonzero, while others argue that c = 0. A nonzero c implies the non-conservation of curvature perturbations in the superhorizon limit, which appears to be inconsistent with the separate universe pic- ture [3]. In this work, we focus on the question of whether c = 0 or not. The authors in Refs. [29\u201335] have shown c = 0 using different approaches. Refs. [29, 30, 33] use the comov- ing gauge and take into account the boundary terms. 1 See also Ref. [8] for an earlier work claiming the non-conservation of the superhorizon curvature perturbations with the use of the Hartree factorization. Ref. [32] uses the path-integral approach. Refs. [31, 34] (our previous papers) use the spatially-flat gauge. Ref. [35] utilizes the gauge transformation. This raises a question: If these works are correct, what was overlooked in the original study [7] and its follow- up [25]? The original works take the comoving gauge but use the field redefinition of curvature perturbations to remove the boundary term contributions. This makes it difficult to directly compare their results with those in Refs. [29, 30, 33], even though they use the same gauge. The main goal of this work is to address this question. To this end, we connect the results in the spatially-flat gauge [31, 34] to those in the comoving gauge. Specifi- cally, we use the fact that the redefined curvature pertur- bation is proportional to the inflaton fluctuation in the spatially-flat gauge. A similar approach has been done in Ref. [35]. The main difference is that we take into account the counterterms and impose the zero-tadpole condition \u27e8\u03b6n\u27e9= 0, where \u03b6n represents the redefined curvature per- turbation. Under this condition, backreaction effects are absent, and unlike Ref. [35], we do not need to introduce backreaction terms in our analysis. This setup aligns more closely with previous works, as most of them either explicitly or implicitly impose the zero-tadpole condition, effectively neglecting tadpole contributions. Then, we will see that the counterterms play an impor- tant role in the cancellation of the one-loop power spec- trum of the superhorizon curvature perturbations. This counterterm contribution was overlooked in the original studies [7, 25], as well as in many subsequent works. No- tably, the importance of the counterterm contribution for the curvature conservation has been emphasized in Refs. [6, 33], although these works do not use the field redefinition. Throughout this work, we consider the de Sitter limit (\u03f5(\u2261\u2212\u02d9H/H2) \u21920) and neglect the higher-order terms in \u03f5 for simplicity. II. SETUP We use the expressions of the Hamiltonian in the spatially-flat gauge to obtain those in the comoving gauge with the redefined curvature perturbations.
