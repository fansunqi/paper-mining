  "abstract": "Context. The combination between non-thermal and thermal emission in \u03b3-ray blazars pushes them to a specific region of the mid- infrared three-dimensional color diagram, the so-called blazar locus, built based on observations performed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The selection of blazar candidates based on these mid-infrared colors has been extensively used in the past decade in the hunt for the counterparts of unassociated \u03b3-ray sources observed with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and in the search for new blazars in optical spectroscopic campaigns. Aims. In this work, we provide a theoretical description of the origin of the blazar locus and show how we can reasonably reproduce it with a model consisting of only three spectral components: a log-parabola accounting for the non-thermal emission, and an elliptical host and dust torus accounting for the thermal emission. Methods. We simulate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for blazars, starting with a pure log-parabola model and then increasing its complexity by adding a template elliptical galaxy and dust torus. From these simulations, we compute the mid-infrared magnitudes and corresponding colors to create our own version of the blazar locus. Results. Our modeling allows for the selection of spectral parameters that better characterize the mid-infrared emission of \u03b3-ray blazars, such as the log-parabola curvature (\u03b2 < 0.04 for 50% of our sample) and an average spectral peak around Ep \u22481.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg. We also find that the log-parabola is the main spectral component behind the observed mid-infrared blazar colors, although additional components such as a host galaxy and a dust torus are crucial to obtain a precise reconstruction of the blazar locus.

Introduction Blazars are one of the most elusive types of active galactic nu- clei (AGNs) and their multiwavelength emission, mainly non- thermal, arises from the acceleration of charged particles in a relativistic jet closely aligned with the line of sight (Blandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979). They are divided into two main classes based on their optical spectra (Massaro et al. 2009), i.e., the BL Lacs, which present only weak emission or absorption lines (equiva- lent widths < 5 \u00c5), or even a continuum-dominated spectrum completely depleted of lines (Stickel et al. 1991; Landoni et al. 2014); and the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), which have broad emission lines, a dominant blue continuum, and a flat ra- dio spectrum (spectral index \u03b1 < 0.5 in the 1 \u223c5 GHz range; Chen et al. 2009; Ghisellini et al. 2011). Although relatively rare among AGNs, blazars are the dominant population in the \u03b3-ray sky, accounting for more than 50% of all sources observed so far with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT; Abdollahi et al. 2022). The non-thermal emission of blazars produces a character- istic spectral energy distribution (SED) that exhibits two broad bumps: one at low energies, originating from the synchrotron emission of relativistic particles accelerated in the blazar jet and peaking somewhere between the radio and soft X-rays; and a second one peaking at \u03b3-rays typically associated with the in- verse Compton scattering of local synchrotron or external ther- \u22c6E-mail: raniere.m.menezes@gmail.com mal photons by the relativistic leptons in the blazar jet (Fossati et al. 1998; Ghisellini et al. 1998; Abdo et al. 2010), although a hadronic interpretation is also possible (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2013; de Menezes et al. 2020c). This particular SED shape, dominated by non-thermal emission, positions \u03b3-ray blazars in a distinct re- gion of the mid-infrared three-dimensional color space defined by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) filters, the so-called blazar locus (Massaro et al. 2011, 2012b; D\u2019Abrusco et al. 2014). These mid-infrared properties of blazars have then been used as a diagnostic tool for the characterization of AGNs (Stern et al. 2012; Assef et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2013; Mateos et al. 2013) and the identification/association of uncertain and unknown low- energy counterparts of Fermi-LAT \u03b3-ray sources (Massaro et al. 2012b, 2015b; Massaro & D\u2019Abrusco 2016; Abdollahi et al. 2020; de Menezes et al. 2020b), many of which were later con- firmed to be blazars via optical spectroscopy (e.g., Paggi et al. 2013; Ricci et al. 2015; Crespo et al. 2016; Marchesini et al. 2019; de Menezes et al. 2020a; Pe\u00f1a-Herazo et al. 2020, 2021; Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. 2023). In this context, the WISE Blazar- Like Radio-Loud Sources catalog (WIBRaLS; D\u2019Abrusco et al. 2014, 2019; de Menezes et al. 2019) emerges as one of the most successful catalogs of \u03b3-ray blazar candidates, which was de- signed by selecting radio-loud sources detected in all four WISE bands (nominally at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 \u00b5m) and presenting mid- infrared colors similar to those of Fermi-LAT blazars (i.e. within the blazar locus).
