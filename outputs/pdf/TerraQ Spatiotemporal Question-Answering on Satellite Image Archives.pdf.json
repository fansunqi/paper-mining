  "abstract": "\u2014TerraQ is a spatiotemporal question-answering en- gine for satellite image archives. It is a natural language processing system that is built to process requests for satellite images satisfying certain criteria. The requests can refer to image metadata and entities from a specialized knowledge base (e.g., the Emilia-Romagna region). With it, users can make requests like \u201cGive me a hundred images of rivers near ports in France, with less than 20% snow coverage and more than 10% cloud coverage\u201d, thus making Earth Observation data more easily accessible, in-line with the current landscape of digital assistants. Index Terms\u2014Question-Answering, Knowledge Graph, Geospatial, Temporal, Earth Observation, SPARQL I. INTRODUCTION The field of Natural Language Processing is undergoing major advancements caused by the rapid development of Language Models [1\u20133]. An outcome of this development is the proliferation of digital assistants and natural language interfaces for all manners of systems and knowledge reposito- ries (e.g., Alexa from Amazon, Siri from Apple, ChatGPT from OpenAI, and Claude from Anthropic). The resulting increase in accessibility enables non-technical users to in- tuitively interact with computer systems and access high- quality information, while also improving efficiency for expert users. In this climate, the task of Knowledge-Graph Question- Answering (QA), also known as Text-to-SPARQL, is as rele- vant as ever [4, 5]. QA systems take as input queries in natural language and generate semantically equivalent SPARQL1 queries over a specific knowledge graph (KG). These SPARQL queries are subsequently executed on an RDF store, which in turn returns the answer. The answer can either be directly presented to the user, or integrated into a larger system and used as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation [6] pipeline, as is the case with digital assistants that rely on knowledge grounding. In our work, we are developing TerraQ a spatiotemporal QA engine for satellite image archives.

For example, \u201cShow me images of Athens with VV polarization.%\u201d. The goal of our research is to make Earth Observation data archives accessible via natural language, to the benefit of both novice and expert users. TerraQ belongs in the same family of engines as GeoQA2 [7] and EarthQA [8], two template-based question- answering engines previously developed by our group. GeoQA2 is a geospatial QA engine, and EarthQA is a satellite- image archive QA engine that reuses some components of GeoQA2 while also adding some additional specialized com- ponents. In comparison to these two systems, TerraQ has a number of advantages. First, it does away with template- based query generation. As a result, it is able to answer a wider array of questions and has improved accuracy. Second, TerraQ targets a purpose-built KG with high-quality geospatial information, allowing for more fine-grained results, which was one of the limitations of the original EarthQA paper. Third, unlike EarthQA, the engine does not use specialized components. All thematic information can be integrated into the core engine architecture, making the engine easier to adapt to different domains. In this paper, we make the following original contributions: 1) We present a specialized knowledge graph that interlinks geospatial information about natural features and admin- istrative divisions with satellite image metadata. Knowl- edge graph resources are integrated into a hierarchical structure, making it easier to expand with additional geospatial information or thematic knowledge. 2) We develop TerraQ, a spatiotemporal QA engine for image archives. The engine is able to answer simple and complex queries both reliably and quickly in dynamic fashion, while also avoiding the use of query-templates or computationally demanding neural models. The version of TerraQ presented in this paper has been developed in the context of the European Space Agency project DA4DTE: Demonstrator Precursor Digital Assistant Interface for Digital Twin Earth2 and a demo is available publicly at http://terraq.di.uoa.gr/. 2http://da4dte.e-geos.earth/ arXiv:2502.04415v1 [cs.CV] 6 Feb 2025"
