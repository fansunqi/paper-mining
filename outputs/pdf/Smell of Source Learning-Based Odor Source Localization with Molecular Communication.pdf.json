  "abstract": "\u2014Odor source localization is a fundamental challenge in molecular communication, environmental monitoring, disaster response, industrial safety, and robotics. In this study, we investi- gate three major approaches: Bayesian filtering, machine learn- ing (ML) models, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the aim of odor source localization in a single-source, single- molecule case. By considering the source-sensor architecture as a transmitter-receiver model we explore source localization under the scope of molecular communication. Synthetic datasets are generated using a 2D advection-diffusion PDE solver to evaluate each method under varying conditions, including sensor noise and sparse measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) achieve the lowest localization error of 0.89 \u00d7 10\u22126 m, outperforming machine learning (ML) inversion (1.48 \u00d7 10\u22126 m) and Kalman filtering (1.62 \u00d7 10\u22126 m). The reinforcement learning (RL) approach, while achieving a localization error of 3.01 \u00d7 10\u22126 m, offers an inference time of 0.147 s, highlighting the trade-off between accu- racy and computational efficiency among different methodologies.

INTRODUCTION O DOR source localization (OSL) is a critical challenge in molecular and nanoscale communications, environmen- tal monitoring, disaster response, industrial safety, and robotics [1]\u2013[3]. As an inverse problem, OSL requires detecting a chemical signal in a turbulent medium and inferring its source location despite unpredictable dispersion effects. Various strategies have been proposed to address this prob- lem. In robotics, Gaussian plume models combined with Bayesian filtering have been used for robust odor tracking under noisy conditions [4]\u2013[7]. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches [4], [8] enable agents to navigate turbulent environ- ments without relying on direct gradient measurements. More recently, deep learning techniques including conventional neu- ral networks and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [9]\u2013[11] have been applied to solve forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics, leading rapid source localization in molecular communication systems [2], [12]. Although many methods have been developed for macroscale environments, the underlying physical and math- Ayse Sila Okcu is with the Internet of Everything Group, Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, CB3 0FA Cambridge, U.K. (e-mail: aso32@cam.ac.uk).

In molecular communication, the transmitterreceiver architecture mirrors OSL, as nanoscale sensors detect molecu- lar signals emitted from localized sources [12], [13]. This has direct applications in biomedical systems and nanonetworks, such as chemical sensing in microfluidic channels and in vivo tracking of signaling molecules. In this work, we frame OSL within the molecular commu- nication paradigm and compare various approaches: Bayesian and learning-based models. Synthetic datasets generated using a 2D advectiondiffusion PDE solver [6], [14] are employed to evaluate each method under varying noise and sensor conditions. Our quantitative results highlight trade-offs in computational efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, thereby demonstrating the potential of these techniques for molecular- scale odor source localization. II. METHODS In MC-based networks, nanomachines or microscale sensors attempt to locate a signaling molecule\u2019s origin, similar to how OSL techniques estimate an odor sources position [1], [2]. To simulate these systems, we use the advection-diffusion equa- tion, describing how molecules or odor particles propagate under diffusion and external forces (e.g., wind or fluid flow) as described in [6], [14]. Physical modeling using the advection- diffusion PDE to generate synthetic concentration fields sim- ilar to [5]. As our main methods, we considered Bayesian methods to iteratively estimate the source location as described in [4], [15] and Learning-based models to approximate odor concentration without solving PDEs using surrogate models as in [11]. All experiments were conducted in Python 3.8 with PyTorch for ML/PINNs applications, running on an Intel i7 CPU (16 GB RAM) without GPU acceleration. The complete source code and data are publicly available1. A. Domain and Source Parameters We consider a two-dimensional microfluidic channel of size 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m2, discretized into a 50 \u00d7 50 grid. This envi- ronment simulates a typical setting of lab-on-a-chip devices and microfluidic platforms used in biomedical applications. In such systems, chemical or molecular signals are often released from a localized transmitter (e.g., a nanomachine or a cell secreting signaling molecules) and detected by microscale sensors embedded within the channel. 1The source code and data can be accessed at: https://github.com/aysesila/ OSL-SingleSource. arXiv:2502.07112v1 [eess.SP] 10 Feb 2025"
