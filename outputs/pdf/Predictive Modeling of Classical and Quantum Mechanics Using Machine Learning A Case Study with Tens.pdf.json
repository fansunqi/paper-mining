  "abstract": "In this paper, we present several machine learning approaches for pre- dicting the behavior of both classical and quantum systems. For the classical domain, we model a pendulum subject to multiple forces using both a standard artificial neural network (ANN) and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). For the quantum domain, we predict the ground state energy of a quantum anharmonic oscillator from discretized potential data using an ANN with convolutional layers (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a PINN that incorporates the Schr\u00a8odinger equation. Detailed training outputs and comparisons are provided. 1 Introduction Traditional approaches to modeling physical systems require solving complex differential equations. For example, the motion of a simple pendulum is typically described by second-order differential equations, while the quantum anharmonic oscillator is governed by Schr\u00a8odinger\u2019s equation. These mathematical models re- quire considerable domain knowledge, careful formulation, and often numerical solutions due to their nonlinearity. In contrast, machine learning, specifically neural networks, provides a fundamentally different approach to modeling such systems. Instead of explicitly solving differential equations, neural networks learn the relationship between input and output directly from data. By using a sufficiently large dataset, a neural network can approximate the system dy- namics without explicitly knowing the governing physical laws. This approach is particularly useful when the system is too complex to model analytically or when certain parameters are unknown or difficult to determine. Machine learning methods offer an alternative by learning system dynamics directly from simulation data. In this study, we address two systems: 1 arXiv:2502.05621v1 [quant-ph] 8 Feb 2025"
