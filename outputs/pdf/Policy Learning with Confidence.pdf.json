  "abstract": ". This paper proposes a framework for selecting policies that maximize expected benefit in the presence of estimation uncertainty, by controlling for estimation risk and in- corporating risk aversion. The proposed method explicitly balances the size of the estimated benefit against the uncertainty inherent in its estimation, ensuring that chosen policies meet a reporting guarantee, namely that the actual benefit of the implemented policy is guar- anteed not to fall below the reported estimate with a pre-specified confidence level. This approach applies to a variety of settings, including the selection of policy rules that allocate individuals to treatments based on observed characteristics, using both experimental and non-experimental data; and the allocation of limited budgets among competing social pro- grams; as well as many others. Across these applications, the framework offers a principled and robust method for making data-driven policy choices under uncertainty. In broader terms, it focuses on policies that are on the efficient decision frontier, describing policies that offer maximum estimated benefit for a given acceptable level of estimation risk. 1. Introduction Consider a decision-maker (DM) faced with choosing from a menu of policies to maximize expected benefit. The DM could for example be a planner deciding how to allocate treat- ments to heterogeneous individuals, a firm choosing different potential innovations in which to invest resources, an auctioneer choosing an optimal auction design or reserve price, or a policy-maker choosing expenditure shares to allocate to government programs to maximize a measure of benefit to the public. If the DM knew the benefit that would be obtained from implementing each policy, the choice would be easy; she would then simply choose the policy that would yield the highest benefit. However, the DM lacks such precise knowledge, but instead has data that can be used to consistently estimate the benefit that would be achieved Date: February 14, 2025.
