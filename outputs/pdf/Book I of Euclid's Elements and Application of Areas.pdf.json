  "title": "Book I of Euclid's Elements and Application of Areas.pdf",
  "abstract": "We work through Book I of Euclid\u2019s Elements with our focus on ap- plication of areas (I.42, I.44, I.45). We summarize alternate constructions from medieval editions of Euclid\u2019s elements and ancient and medieval commentaries. We remark that Euclid\u2019s proof of I.44 involves a seldom commented on use of superposition, but that several medieval editions of Euclid give constructions that avoid the use of superposition. This use of superposition is also avoided in Ralph Abraham\u2019s \u201cVCE: The Visual Constructions of Euclid\u201d C#12, C#12B at http://www.visual-euclid. org/vce/contents.html We collate the figures with the digitized editions of Euclid at (P) Bib- lioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV), Vat. gr. 190, (F) Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 28.03, (B) Bodleian, MS.
