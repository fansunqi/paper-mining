  "abstract": "This paper focuses on simulating text dia- logues in which impressions between speak- ers improve during speed dating. This simula- tion involves selecting an utterance from mul- tiple candidates generated by a text generation model that replicates a speci\ufb01c speaker\u2019s ut- terances, aiming to improve the impression of the speaker. Accurately selecting an utterance that improves the impression is crucial for the simulation. We believe that whether an utter- ance improves a dialogue partner\u2019s impression of the speaker may depend on the personalities of both parties. However, recent methods for utterance selection do not consider the impres- sion per utterance or the personalities. To ad- dress this, we propose a method that predicts whether an utterance improves a partner\u2019s im- pression of the speaker, considering the per- sonalities. The evaluation results showed that personalities are useful in predicting impres- sion changes per utterance. Furthermore, we conducted a human evaluation of simulated di- alogues using our method. The results showed that it could simulate dialogues more favorably received than those selected without consider- ing personalities. 1 Introduction Many people spend signi\ufb01cant time and cost on speed dating to \ufb01nd their lifelong partners. To mitigate this, a previous research has proposed a method for predicting speed dating results before physically interacting with potential partners(Ishii et al., 2023). This method enables participants to engage only with pre-selected partners, optimizing their time and resources. Despite the pre-selection, participants must en- gage in real dialogues with their potential partners, without opportunities for retries. Initial nervous- ness may lead to poor word choices, thereby risk- ing a negative \ufb01rst impression. Consequently, a po- tentially compatible match might not select them, \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0007\u0006 \u0002 \u0005 \u0005 \u000e \u0007\u000f \u0002 \u0001\u0005\u0003\u0010\u0011 \u0012\u0013 \u0011\u0006\u000e \u0014 \u0011\u0015 \u000e\u0016\u0011\u0016\u0005\u0017\u0017\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0001\u0005\u0003\u0019\u0011\u001a\u0011\u0017\u0007\u001b\u0005\u0011\u0015 \u000e\u0016\u0007 \u0011 \u000e \u0007 \u0005\u0011\u0006 \u000e \u000e\u0006 \u0005 \u0003\u0019 \u0001\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0011\u0011\u001a\u0003\u0011 \u000f\u0013 \u0011 \u000f\u0012\u0012 \u0011 \u0007\u0003\u0011\u0016\u000e \u0006 \u0007 \u0011 \u000f \u0007\u0005\u0003 !\u000f\u0011 \u000f\u0013\u0011\u0017\u0007\u001b\u0005\u0011\u0015 \u000e\u0016\u0007 \u0001\u0005\u0003\u0019\u0011\u001a\u0011\u0017\u0007\u001b\u0005\u0011\u0015 \u000e\u0016\u0007 \u0011 \u000e \u0007 \u0005\u0011\u0006 \u000e \u000e\u0006 \u0005 \u0003\u0019 \u0005 \u000e \u0006\u0005\u0011\u0003\u0005\u0017\u0005\u0006 \u000f \"\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0007\u0006 \u0002 \u0005 \u0005 \u000e \u0007\u000f #\u0005\u0017\u0005\u0006 \u0007 \u0011\u000e \u0011\u0013 \u0005 \u000e \u0006\u0005\u0011 \u000f\u0011\u0007 \u0004 \u000f \u0005\u0011 \"$\u0003\u0011\u0007 \u0004 \u0005\u0003\u0003\u0007\u000f \u0011\u000f\b\u0011\u0001 \u0005 \u000e \u0006\u0005\u0011\u0006\u000e \u0015\u0007\u0015\u000e \u0005\u0003 Figure 1: Example of expected dialogue simulation. even if mutual compatibility exists. If we were able to simulate dialogues that leave favorable im- pressions (e.g., love scale (Rubin, 1973)) on their partners, they could understand their partners\u2019 pre- ferred dialogue styles (e.g., some are good listen- ers while others talk more) in advance. This can minimize the unfortunate missteps and improve the ef\ufb01ciency of actual interactions. However, ut- terances and dialogues that leave a positive impres- sion may vary depending on speakers\u2019 personali- ties, making such simulation challenging. This research aims to realize this dialogue sim- ulation system. As shown in Fig. 1, this sys- tem involves choosing an utterance that would im- prove speaker X\u2019s impression of speaker Y from multiple candidates generated by a text genera- tion model capable of reproducing speaker X/Y\u2019s utterances. In other words, this system requires two key methodologies: (1) person-speci\ufb01c utter- ance generation, which replicates what a person is likely to say, and (2) impression-based utterance selection, which predicts and selects an utterance judged to improve the impression. Person-speci\ufb01c utterance generation, essential for reproducing di- alogues between speakers X and Y, has been ex- plored in various studies (Li et al., 2016; Kottur et al., 2017; Higashinaka et al., 2018; Mitsuda et al., 2022; Otsuka et al., 2024).
