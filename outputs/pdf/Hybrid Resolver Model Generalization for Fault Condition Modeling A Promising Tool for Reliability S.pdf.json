  "abstract": "\u2014 Resolvers, like all electromagnetic devices, are constantly under investigation, both operationally and structurally. In this regard, proposing a modeling methodology that can save significant time without compromising accuracy is a big honor. In this study, a generalized hybrid model is suggested that, in addition to the above benefits, has sufficient capability to ease reliability study in the field of resolvers, where a large number of faulty conditions must be investigated under different operating conditions, including changes in angular velocity, voltage, and frequency of excitation\u2014all of which are highlighted in the context of fault coverage. This model also serves as a promising tool for generating large datasets, which is advantageous for fault diagnosis. A resolver with a non-uniform air gap is chosen as a case study to challenge the suggested model, particularly in relation to eccentricity faults. We generalize the suggested model to account for the most common faulty conditions of resolvers: in-turn short circuits in signal and excitation windings, as well as static and dynamic eccentricity faults. The close agreement between the results of the suggested model and those from Time-Stepping Finite Element Analysis (TS-FEA), along with significant time savings in both healthy and faulty conditions, highlights the generality and proficiency of the suggested model. Finally, the case study is prototyped, and we verify the accuracy of the suggested model experimentally.

INTRODUCTION LOBAL warming is the main concern that ignites a wave of interest among scholars to find solutions for at least reducing its growth. Electric cars are one such solution that has begun to gain attention. The heart of these cars is electric motors, which are most often Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) due to their well-known advantages, such as high efficiency and dynamic. The control of these motors heavily has a dependency on the data that the drive system accesses through sensors, such as current and rotor angle, among others. In this context, the accuracy of the rotor angle sensor, as shown in [1], has a significant effect on drive stability and even more on the reliability of the entire system. In this regard, almost all designers in the industry consider Authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran 16846-13114, Iran (e-mail: mohammadkhajuee@yahoo.com; tootoonchian@iust.ac.ir; apourghoraba@gmail.com). resolvers as their first choice, since they have shown satisfactory tolerance in the face of harsh operating conditions, including excessive noise, heat, and dust\u2014significant weaknesses that encoders suffer from due to their sensitive physical configuration [2]. Although resolvers have shown their proficiency, there is still a necessity to study their behavior under different faulty conditions, particularly in terms of lifetime and fault management. In lifetime management [3], we analyze and estimate the lifetime of the investigated system; the resolver is a subsystem within the larger electric car system. Following this, we make efforts to redesign resolvers to achieve better accuracy and fault tolerance, synonymous with a longer lifetime for the entire system. On the other hand, in fault management [4], we will suggest different methodologies to engineers that can be advantageous for fault diagnosis, isolation, and even mitigation in resolvers. A common theme among all these is the examination of resolvers when one or overlapping faulty conditions occur; therefore, a designer should have a clear understanding of what will occur to the resolver under faulty conditions. Prototyping a resolver, even in healthy conditions, is time-consuming and costly; thus, if a designer wants to study a resolver\u2019s reliability (each of lifetime and fault management), fabricating a large number of faulty resolvers is not pragmatic. In this regard, different modeling methodologies have been suggested to make this faster and more cost-effective. However, we should search for a candidate that can offer all metrics together: accuracy and time efficiency. Hence, Time-Stepping Finite Element Analysis (TS-FEA) is not the best choice [5]; although it gives high accuracy in modeling, each run takes a significant amount of time due to the high-frequency excitation of the resolver, and subsequently, the high sampling frequency, requiring for signal voltage calculations to achieve better results from signal processing. If we are looking to save time, analytical models are better choices. In this context, MEC and Winding Function (WF) are the analytical modeling methodologies that have been employed for fault modeling in resolvers [6]-[10]. It is evident that each of them struggles with disadvantages, particularly when dealing with diverse physical configurations and faulty conditions, impacting both time efficiency and accuracy. G"
