  "abstract": "We conducted precise measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) clustering at z \u223c1 and z \u223c2 by measuring the two-point cross-correlation function (CCF) between galaxies and X-ray- selected AGNs, and the two-point auto-correlation function (ACF) of galaxies in the COSMOS field to interpret the CCF results. The galaxy sample was selected from the COSMOS2015 catalog, while the AGN sample was chosen from the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey catalog. For the AGN samples at z \u223c1 and z \u223c2, we calculated AGN bias values of b = 1.16 (1.16; 1.31) and b = 2.95 (2.30; 3.55), respectively. These values correspond to typical host dark matter halo (DMH) masses of log(Mtyp/M\u2299) = 11.82 (11.82; 12.12) and log(Mtyp/M\u2299) = 12.80 (12.38; 13.06), respectively. Subsequently, we performed Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling of X-ray-selected AGNs using the CCF and ACF of galaxies. We have found a significant satellite AGN population at z \u223c1 all over the DMH mass (MDMH) range occupied by AGNs. While z \u223c2 AGNs in our sample are asso- ciated with higher mass DMHs and smaller satellite fractions. The HOD analysis suggests a marginal tendency of increasing satellite slope with redshift, but larger samples are needed to confirm this with sufficient statistical significance. We find that the best-fit values of satellite slope in both redshift bins are greater than 0, suggesting tendencies of increasing satellite AGN number with MDMH.

It is well established that almost all galaxies have a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), imply- ing that the galaxies had gone through at least one pe- riod of AGN activity, i.e., accretion of material onto the nucleus, in the past. The conditions and mechanisms in which AGN activity occurs have been the subject of intensive research. Observational clues to tackle this problem include the luminosity function of AGNs and arXiv:2502.10944v1 [astro-ph.GA] 16 Feb 2025"
