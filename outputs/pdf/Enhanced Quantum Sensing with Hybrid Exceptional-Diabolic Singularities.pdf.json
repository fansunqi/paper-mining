  "abstract": "Chhajlany,1 and Adam Miranowicz1 1Institute of Spintronics and Quantum Information, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, Adam Mickiewicz University, 61-614 Pozna\u00b4n, Poland (Dated: February 7, 2025) We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ulti- mate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling. I. INTRODUCTION The study of non-Hermitian systems, which feature com- plex eigenvalues, has gained significant attention due to their intriguing and unconventional properties. A key phe- nomenon in such systems is the presence of exceptional points (EPs)\u2014singularities in the complex energy plane where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. First studied in phys- ical context in [1], EPs arise in parameter-dependent eigen- value problems and are encountered in a wide range of phys- ical systems, such as optics, mechanics, quantum phase tran- sitions, and quantum chaos [2\u20135]. In contrast, diabolic points (DPs), introduced in [6], arise in Hermitian systems as in- stances of eigenvalue degeneracies where eigenvectors remain orthogonal. These points are closely associated with geomet- ric phases and Berry\u2019s curvature. Remarkably, certain non- Hermitian systems can exhibit both EPs and DPs, with their intersections giving rise to hybrid exceptional-diabolic (HED) points. These HED points blend the distinct features of both singularities and offers valuable insights into the interplay be- tween Hermitian and non-Hermitian physics unlocking poten- tial applications across diverse physical domains [7\u201310]. Recent advances in quantum sensing have highlighted the transformative potential of non-Hermitian systems in achiev- ing ultra-sensitive measurements, especially through the use of exceptional point singularities, where small perturbations lead to disproportionately large responses. This property can dramatically amplify sensitivity, offering a pathway to high- precision measurements that would be infeasible in Hermitian frameworks [11\u201314]. A system near an EP, when perturbed, displays eigenvalue splitting that scales as the nth root of the perturbation size (\u223c n\u221a\u03f5), yielding a steep sensitivity that can surpass what is achievable in Hermitian settings where pertur- bations result in linear or quadratic responses [15]. Experi- mental work with optical resonators has validated this princi- ple, demonstrating that under carefully controlled conditions, non-Hermitian systems can achieve extremely sensitive mea- surements [16, 17]. However, under real-world noise condi- tions, this sensitivity is typically limited by quantum noise, which can diminish the response and limit the achievable gains [18\u201326]. \u2217Electronic address: javid.naikoo@amu.edu.pl In particular, [18, 23] argue convincingly that EP sensors do not provide any fundamental improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), challenging the notion that exceptional points inherently enhance sensor performance. Building on this, [19] highlights that enhanced sensitivity is primarily driven by nonreciprocity rather than the proximity to an exceptional point. This study establishes fundamental bounds on signal power and SNR for two-mode sensors, demonstrating that while gain is necessary for enhanced signal power, it does not rely on being near an EP. Furthermore, it shows that when fluctuation effects are considered, the SNR of any reciprocal system is fundamentally constrained, regardless of its use of EPs. These insights critically address the limitations of EP- based sensing, shifting the focus from EP proximity to more significant factors such as nonreciprocal interactions and gain in the system dynamics. Instead of relying on eigenmode coalescence at EPs, singularity-tuned systems take advantage of internal param- eter tuning that amplifies response to perturbations \u2013 a sensi- tivity boost that differs fundamentally from that of EP-based systems [22, 24]. This divergence is related to proximity to a dynamical phase transition, which has recently been rec- ognized as a valuable resource in quantum sensing. Unlike the more conventional amplification methods, this approach benefits from the unique properties of singularities in the non- Hermitian space, creating a form of criticality-enhanced sen- sitivity that is robust under a wider range of noise conditions than EP-based systems [27\u201331]. In [24], it was demonstrated that in a two-mode bosonic system, the error \u03b4\u03b8 in estimating a parameter \u03b8 scales as \u03b4\u03b8 \u221d\u03b8s, where s corresponds to the order of the pole in the singular response function. Notably, when the parameter af- fects the common frequency and the singularity arises from satisfying the EP condition, the error exhibits quadratic scal- ing. This work extends the previous analysis by generalizing it to a four-mode cavity system featuring both a second-order EP and a second-order DP. We demonstrate that quadratic scal- ing persists at the second-order EP, even when an orthogonal subspace emerges due to the second-order DP. In the system under consideration, satisfying both the EP condition and the singularity condition of the dynamical generator necessitates meeting the diabolic condition. As a result, enhanced preci- sion is observed specifically at HED points.
