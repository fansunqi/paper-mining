Angelo, IT-80126 Napoli, Italy The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission medium to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering. A key factor in the progress of spintronics and spin- orbitronics, as well as in the development of new func- tionalities in solid materials, is the capacity to encode, manipulate, and store information using spin and orbital angular momentum. A promising and widely utilized approach for designing spin functionalities and facilitat- ing charge-to-spin conversion involves strong spin-orbit coupling and acentric materials. The spin-momentum locking [1, 2] allows for the control of the spin angular moment by transforming, for instance, an unpolarized charge current into a spin density and transverse spin current through Edelstein and spin Hall effects [3\u20138]. It has recently been discovered that many spin-related phe- nomena can be traced back to orbital mechanisms [9] even without the presence of atomic spin-orbit coupling. In this context, orbital-based couplings can give rise to orbital Hall [10\u201316], orbital Edelstein [17\u201321], inverse or- bital Edelstein effects [22], orbital photocurrents [23], and orbital sources of Berry curvature [24, 25]. In systems with weak spin-orbit coupling when inver- sion symmetry breaking occurs alongside the absence of other crystalline symmetries, as seen in chiral struc- tures, other effects can emerge and electron transmission demonstrates selective filtering based on the spin of the electrons. This effect, referred to as chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS), arises from the polarization of elec- tron spins by chiral molecules [26, 27]. Although CISS has primarily been observed in chiral molecules, stud- ies have revealed that chiral crystals can also generate spin-polarized states through the injection of charge cur- rents [28\u201330]. Despite several investigations there is no consensus on the mechanisms behind the CISS. However, orbital texture and orbital polarization effects have been proposed to induce spin-polarization both in chiral sys- tems but also in achiral materials that, however, lack a center of inversion [31]. All of these observations indicate that breaking inver- sion symmetry, along with the presence of spin and or- bital textures in momentum space, plays a crucial role for controlling electron spin and orbital moments. Nev- ertheless, there are certain cases where orbital dynamics [32] and hidden spin polarization can arise in centrosym- metric systems [33, 34] or spin-filtering is achieved with centrosymmetric molecules [35]. Therefore, understand- ing the mechanisms that enable the manipulation and control of spin and orbital moments from a symmetry perspective is essential. In this Letter, we address this fundamental issue by exploring how spin and orbital moment filtering can take place in centrosymmetric systems. By utilizing orbital couplings that preserve inversion symmetry and break both mirror and rotational symmetries, we demonstrate the selective transfer of electrons with a specific orienta- tion of orbital momentum. Our findings reveal the con- nection between symmetry-breaking interactions and the manipulation of the orbital moment orientation for the transmitted electronic states. Consequently, spin filter- ing can be realized by introducing a non-zero atomic spin- orbit coupling (SOC) in the centrosymmetric transmis- sion medium. Our analysis indicates the path to achieve high efficiency filtering in the generation of both spin- and orbitally polarized currents by injecting unpolarized electrons into a centrosymmetric medium that lacks mir- ror and rotational symmetry (Fig. 1).
