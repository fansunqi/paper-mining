In this paper, we study the time-space fractional di\ufb00erential equa- tion of the Volterra type: D\u03b1 0|t(u) + (\u2212\u2206N)\u03c3u = u(1 + au \u2212bu2) \u2212au Z t 0 K(t \u2212s)u(\u00b7) ds, where a, b > 0 are given constants, \u03b1, \u03c3 \u2208(0, 1), equipped with a homogeneous Neumann\u2019s boundary condition and a positive initial data. The boundedness and uniform continuity of the solution on the entire R+ are established. More- over, the asymptotic behavior of the positive solution is investigated.

Introduction In this paper, we are interested to study the time asymptotic behavior of the bounded solution of the following problem D\u03b1 0|t(u) + (\u2212\u2206N)\u03c3u = u(1 + au \u2212bu2) \u2212auK \u2217u, (1) u(x, 0) = u0(x), (2) posed on Q = \u2126\u00d7 (0, T) where \u2126\u2282Rd (where d = 1, 2 in practice) is a bounded domain with smooth boundary \u2202\u2126with outward normal \u03b7; the asterisk (\u2217) denotes the time convolution, i.e K \u2217u(x, t) = Z t 0 K(t \u2212s)u(\u00b7, s)ds; the constants a and b in the problem are assumed to be positive and K is the delay kernel function satisfying K \u22650, K \u2208C1(0, \u221e) \u2229L1(0, \u221e), Z \u221e 0 K(t)dt = 1. The derivative operator D\u03b1 0|t is the Caputo fractional derivative of order 0 \u2264\u03b1 \u22641, the operator (\u2212\u2206N)\u03c3, 0 < \u03c3 < 1, is the fractional power of the classical Laplacian operator with its speci\ufb01ed domain and u0(x) \u22650 is a given bounded function. Equation (1) describes the evolution of a single species population whose density is u at time t in the bounded domain \u2126. As in the existing model with classical 1"
