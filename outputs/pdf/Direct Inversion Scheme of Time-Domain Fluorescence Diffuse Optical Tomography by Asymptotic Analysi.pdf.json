  "title": "Direct Inversion Scheme of Time-Domain Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography by Asymptotic Analysi.pdf",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a direct inversion scheme for \ufb02uorescence di\ufb00use optical tomography (FDOT) to reconstruct the location of a point target using the measured peak time of the temporal response functions. A sphere is de\ufb01ned for the target, with its radius determined by the peak time, indicating that the target lies on the sphere. By constructing a tetrahedron with edges determined by the radii, we identify the location of the target as the vertex of the tetrahedron. Asymptotically, we derive the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the peak time. Several numerical tests are implemented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the asymptotic relationship and the inversion scheme. Keywords.
