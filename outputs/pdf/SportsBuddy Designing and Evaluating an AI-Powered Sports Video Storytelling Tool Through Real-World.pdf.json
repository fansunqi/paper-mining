  "abstract": "Video storytelling is essential for sports performance analysis and fan engagement, enabling sports professionals and fans to effectively communicate and interpret the spatial and temporal dynamics of gameplay. Traditional methods rely on manual annotation and ver- bal explanations, placing significant demands on creators for video editing skills and on viewers for cognitive focus. However, these approaches are time-consuming and often struggle to accommodate individual needs. SportsBuddy addresses this gap with an intuitive, interactive video authoring tool.
