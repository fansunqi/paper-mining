  "abstract": "The \ud835\udc4a-boson charge asymmetry as a function of lepton \ud835\udf02is also measured. The data, collected in dedicated runs at reduced instantaneous luminosity with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, correspond to integrated luminosities of 255 pb\u22121 at 5.02 TeV and 338 pb\u22121 at 13 TeV. The measurements are in agreement with Standard-Model predictions calculated at next-to-next-to-leading-order in the strong coupling constant \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc60including transverse-momentum resummation at next-to- next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using several parton distribution functions. The impact of the measured differential cross-sections as a function of lepton \ud835\udf02on the determination of these functions is studied using a profiling technique. \u00a9 2025 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration.
