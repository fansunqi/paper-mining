  "title": "Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Fede.pdf",
  "abstract": "speci\ufb01cation using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original speci\ufb01cations and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque. Here, we aim to provide a more suitable formal foundation for grassroots platforms. To do so, we en- hance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation. We present crisp speci\ufb01cations of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grass- roots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations. We prove a general theorem that a platform speci\ufb01ed by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus speci\ufb01ed are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a better mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.
