  "abstract": "This paper explores a predictive game in which a Forecaster announces odds based on a time-homogeneous Markov kernel, establishing a game-theoretic law of large numbers for the relative frequencies of occurrences of all finite strings. A key feature of our proof is a betting strategy built on a universal coding scheme, inspired by the martingale convergence theorem and algorithmic randomness the- ory, without relying on a diversified betting approach that involves countably many operating accounts. We apply these insights to thermodynamics, offering a game-theoretic perspective on Le\u00b4o Szil\u00b4ard\u2019s thought experiment. Keywords: game-theoretic probability, martingale, universal coding, Szil\u00b4ard\u2019s engine, entropy 1 Introduction Game-theoretic probability theory [1], proposed by Shafer and Vovk in 2001, offers a framework for studying stochastic behavior without relying on traditional concept of probability. To illustrate this approach, we begin by recalling a fundamental result from game-theoretic probability theory. Let \u2126:= {1, 2, . . . , A} be a finite alphabet, and let \u2126n, \u2126\u2217, and \u2126\u221edenote the sets of sequences over \u2126of length n, finite length, and infinite (one-sided) length, respectively. The empty string is denoted by \u03bb. An element of \u2126n is represented symbolically as \u03c9n. We also introduce the notation \u03c9j i := \u03c9i\u03c9i+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c9j for i \u2264j, denoting the substring from the ith to the jth coordinates of a longer sequence \u03c91\u03c92 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c9n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . By convention, if i > j, we set \u03c9j i := \u03bb. For x \u2208\u2126\u2217and y \u2208\u2126\u2217\u222a\u2126\u221e, we write x \u228fy to indicate that x is a prefix of y. Let us introduce the following set: P(\u2126) := ( p : \u2126\u2192(0, 1) X \u03c9\u2208\u2126 p(\u03c9) = 1 ) . \u2217fujiwara@math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp 1 arXiv:2502.02433v1 [cs.IT] 4 Feb 2025"
