  "abstract": "In this work, we study a set of generalized Radon transforms over symmetric m-tensor \ufb01elds in Rn. The longitudinal/transversal Radon transform and corresponding weighted integral transforms for symmetric m-tensor \ufb01eld are introduced. We give the kernel descriptions for the longitudinal and transversal Radon transform. Further, we also prove that a symmetric m-tensor \ufb01eld can be recovered uniquely from certain combinations of these integral transforms of the unknown tensor \ufb01eld. This generalizes a recent study done for the recovery of vector \ufb01elds from its weighted Radon transform data to recovery of a symmetric m-tensor \ufb01eld from analogously de\ufb01ned weighted Radon transforms.

The de\ufb01nition was then extended to higher dimensions with integrals of functions taken along hyperplanes. Since then, many di\ufb00erent generalizations of the Radon transform and their inversions have been studied because of their wide range of applications, see [2, 6, 8, 12, 24, 28] and references therein. All the generalizations are primarily considered the integral of scalar functions over a variety of subsets (for instance, circles, ellipses, spheres, curves, V-lines, cones, and many other geometries). Recently, some extensions of the Radon transform acting on vector \ufb01elds have been studied ([13, 17, 18]) and to the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, there is only one work [25] where the Radon transform over tensor \ufb01elds in R3 is considered. In this work, we introduce a set of generalized Radon transforms acting on symmetric m- tensor \ufb01elds in Rn. In particular, we de\ufb01ne longitudinal Radon transform (LRT) and transversal Radon transform (TRT) along with their weighted versions. Our aim here is to give a description of kernels of longitudinal and transversal Radon transforms and reconstruction of a symmetric m-tensor \ufb01eld from a combination of its LRT/TRT and weighted LRT/TRT.
