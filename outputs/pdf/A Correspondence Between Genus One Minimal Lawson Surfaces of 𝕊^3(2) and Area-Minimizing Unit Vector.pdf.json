  "abstract": ". A correspondence is established between a class of minimal immersed surfaces of S3(2) and area-minimizing unit vector fields defined on the antipodally punctured unit sphere S2\\{N, S}. As a consequence, we establish a stability relation for Lawson cylinders in S3(2). 1. Introduction and main results The present work is a continuation of two previous papers [3] and [2], in which we studied area minimization of unit vector fields defined on the antipodally punctured unit sphere S2\\{N, S} where N = (0, 0, 1) and S = (0, 0, \u22121) are referred to as north and south poles of the unit 2-sphere S2, respectively. We define the area of a unit vector field V on any surface M as the area of the section defined by V in T 1M, where T 1M is endowed with the Sasaki metric and V (M) \u2282T 1M inherits the induced metric. As a first step, we found a family of area-minimizing vector fields for each pair of Poincar\u00b4e indices {IV (N), IV (S)} = {k, 2\u2212k} at the north and south poles of S2, respectively. Clearly, IV (N)+IV (S) = 2. Precisely, we proved the following: Theorem 1 (Brito et al., 3). Let V be a unit vector field defined on M = S2\\{N, S}. If k = max{IV (N), IV (S)}, k \u0338= 0, k \u0338= 2 then area(V ) \u2265\u03c0L(\u03f5k) where L(\u03f5k) denote the length of the ellipse x2 k2 + y2 (k \u22122)2 = 1 and IV (p) stands for the Poincar\u00b4e index of V around p. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 49Q05, 53A10, 58K45.
