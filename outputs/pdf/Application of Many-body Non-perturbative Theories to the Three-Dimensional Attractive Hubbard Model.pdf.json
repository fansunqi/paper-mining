  "abstract": "In this article, we apply several many-body theories in the three-dimensional attractive Hubbard model. Specifically, we compare the results of various GW methods with DQMC simulations and observe that they provide reliable results in the weak to intermediate coupling regime. The critical exponents also agree well with the accurate results obtained from the 3D XY model. In the superconducting phase, the post-GW method significantly improves the description of Green\u2019s functions and density of states. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the temperature at which the pseudogap appears. I. INTRODUCTION The Fermi-Hubbard model serves as a fundamental condensed matter model for strongly correlated fermionic systems [1]. The attractive Hubbard model (AHM) has been used in various studies, including two-dimensional investigations of the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition [2, 3], and in the exploration of the positive-U Hubbard model through particle-hole transformations [4]. Primarily, the AHM provides a platform for studying the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity [5] to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of local pairs [6\u2013 8]. This crossover is important for both high-temperature superconductivity [8\u201310] and cold-atom systems [11\u201318]. While Fermi gas systems are also widely used to study this crossover, there are certain delicacies concerning the renormalization and discretization of continuum theories to lattice systems [19, 20]. In contrast, the AHM can be simulated using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method [21, 22], which is free from the sign problem and provides precise results. Experimental studies on the AHM have been conducted in optical lattices [4, 15, 23\u201325], providing valuable references for theoretical studies [26, 27]. In the 3D AHM, there are mainly two phases: the broken-symmetry phase below the superconducting critical temperature Tc and the normal phase above it. In the normal phase, apart from the BCS limit regime, preformed pairs exist up to a temperature, T \u2217(higher than the superconducting critical temperature). When the temperature goes below the superconducting critical temperature Tc, coherence among the pairs is established [28\u201330]. As the system transitions from the BCS to the BEC regime, these two phenomena exhibit different behaviors. Various many-body methods, such as T-matrix approximation (TMA) [28, 30, 31], dynamical mean-field the- ory (DMFT) [32\u201334], dynamical vertex approximation (D\u0393A) [35, 36] and the two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) [37\u201339], have been applied to study the phenomena in the BCS-BEC crossover. The TMA, developed over recent decades from the perturbative NSR theory [7] to the more advanced self-consistent formulations by Haussmann[40], has found wide application [41\u201345]. However, many of the methods are mainly used to study Fermi gases, where reliable numerical results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations are relatively scarce [20, 46]. The results in the 3D AHM are limited, especially in the discussion of pre-pairing and the relevant calculations in the superconducting phase. Since DQMC provides accurate results in the 3D AHM, it is worthwhile to verify the ef- fectiveness of different theoretical methods, and at the same time, it can serve as a reference for theories in Fermi gases. In this paper, we apply many-body non-perturbative methods [47\u201349] in the 3D AHM and compare numerical results with DQMC simulations. Such methods include the GW [50] and HGW [51] approximations (commonly referred to as G0G in normal phase), which provides a many-body self-consistent description of the TMA. These methods have been applied to strongly correlated systems [44, 52, 53]. The GW approximation is obtained from the first-order truncation of the Hedin equations [47, 48], which contains the screened effect in its self-energy. The HGW method, based on the clustering properties of connected correlators, truncates high-order correlators in the Dyson-Schwinger equation and provides more accurate results in the intermediate-coupling regime [51]. Both methods have been used to calculate Green\u2019s functions. \u2217lidp@pku.edu.cn arXiv:2502.11527v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 17 Feb 2025"
