  "abstract": "We present small triangulations of all connected sums of CP2 and S2 \u00d7 S2 with the standard piecewise linear structure. Our triangulations have 2\u03b22 + 2 pentachora, where \u03b22 is the second Betti number of the manifold. By a conjecture of the authors and, independently, Burke, these triangulations have the smallest possible number of pentachora for their respective topological types. MSC 2020: 57Q15; 57Q05; 57K40. Keywords: Triangulations of manifolds, simply connected 4-manifolds, trian- gulation complexity, minimal triangulations 1 Introduction Given a piecewise linear manifold M, an important measure for how \u201ccompli- cated\u201d it is topologically, is the smallest number of simplices needed to build M from gluing these simplices along their faces, that is, from triangulating M. In the literature, this quantity is referred to as the complexity c(M) of M [25]. A triangulation realising the complexity of its underlying manifold is said to be minimal. Naturally, the size of a minimal triangulation depends on the exact rules of how we are allowed to glue simplices together. If the triangu- lation is required to be a simplicial complex, then the complexity is larger. If graph-encodings of manifolds are considered (that is, regular cell complexes, that allow a rainbow colouring of their vertices), a minimal triangulation is typically considerably smaller. Finally, the truly smallest number of simplices needed to triangulate a manifold is achieved for what is called generalised tri- angulations, where even pairs of faces from the same simplex can be identi\ufb01ed, and a triangulation can have as little as one vertex. For instance, the smallest simplicial complex triangulating the torus has 14 triangles, the smallest graph-encoding has six, and the smallest generalised triangulation has only two, see Figure 1.1. Minimal triangulations are known for all surfaces in all three settings, see, for instance, [15, 18, 30]. For generalised triangulations, minimal triangulations of a surface S of non-positive Euler characteristic \u03c7(S) are precisely those with a single vertex, and S has complexity 2 \u22122\u03c7(S). This holds for both orientable and non-orientable surfaces. For triangulations of 3-dimensional manifolds, the situation is very di\ufb00er- ent. Bounds for the complexity are known for some simplicial triangulations of 1"
