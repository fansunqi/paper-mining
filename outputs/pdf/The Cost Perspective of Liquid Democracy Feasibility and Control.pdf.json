  "abstract": "We examine an approval-based model of Liquid Democracy with a budget constraint on voting and delegating costs, aiming to centrally select casting voters ensuring complete representation of the elec- torate. From a computational complexity perspective, we focus on minimizing overall costs, maintaining short delegation paths, and preventing excessive concentration of voting power. Furthermore, we explore computational aspects of strategic control, specifically, whether external agents can change election com- ponents to influence the voting power of certain voters. 1 Introduction In a perfect democracy, every citizen would ideally have the time, knowledge, and means to actively partic- ipate in every political decision impacting the society. This ideal is hindered by various costs, such as the effort required to understand complex issues or the financial burden of frequent decision-making processes. Liquid Democracy addresses these challenges by allowing well-informed individuals to vote directly, while others (transitively) delegate their voting rights to trusted representatives. By requiring only a subset of the electorate to form opinions and vote, it reduces overall cognitive and operational costs. Originating in the 20th century [Tullock, 1967, Miller III, 1969, Green-Armytage, 2015, Blum and Zuber, 2016], Liquid Democracy has seen widespread implementation in recent years [Paulin, 2020] and has since become a prominent research area within Computational Social Choice [Grossi et al., 2024]. Despite its focus on re- ducing election-related costs, their explicit consideration remains unexplored. We address this by analyzing a natural Liquid Democracy framework operating within a budget constraint. In a Liquid Democracy system costs can arise from various factors, such as the time or effort needed to understand the election topic or to identify participants aligned with their views for vote delegation. These costs broadly reflect preferences between delegation and direct voting. Alternatively, they could correspond to monetary incentives to encourage participation in decisions on complex issues, e.g., when voters prefer not to engage but recognize that some must for the collective good. Costs may also stem from the voters\u2019 expertise based on voting history or their profile and interests. Depending on the context, they can be specified by voters or inferred by the system. Selecting trusted representatives under budget constraints extends beyond Liquid Democracy. The fol- lowing examples demonstrate how our model and questions apply to other domains where being or trusting a representative incurs costs, aiming to minimize these expenses while meeting explicit trust requirements. In a sensor network, a subset of sensors may be designated as cluster heads to aggregate and transmit data to a central hub [Mishra et al., 2019]. These could be chosen to optimize communication and data-driven decision-making, while minimizing costs related to head designation, such as energy consumption and se- curity concerns. In autonomous vehicle fleets, leadership roles in decision-making, like route planning and 1 arXiv:2502.02380v1 [cs.GT] 4 Feb 2025"
