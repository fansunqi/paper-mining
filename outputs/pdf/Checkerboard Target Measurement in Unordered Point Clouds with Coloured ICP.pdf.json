  "abstract": "In this work we investigate the problem of measuring a checkerboard target\u2019s centre in an 3D point cloud. This is an important problem which has applications in registration, long term monitoring and linking to other sensor systems. We use a 3D template matching approach based on the coloured ICP algorithm to solve the problem. We tackle the problem under the additional constraints that we assume no structure in the 3D data in order to be able to handle unordered point clouds. This gives us the capability to process data from the new generation of low-cost LIDAR sensors. This category of sensors also suffers from increased noise in range and reflectivity measurement. We provide extensive simulation results using synthetic data to capture the potential of the approach. We then give the detailed steps for handling real sensor data. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3Dimaging- ucl/3D_ICP. 1. Introduction It is a common workflow scenario for terrestrial laser scanning that several separate stations are necessary to capture a scene. The alignment of the stations into a common reference frame is usually referred to as regis- tration. Several alternative approaches exist to solve the alignment problem. Often, approaches for terrestrial laser scanning can be traced back to classical surveying, photogrammetry, or computer vision. We can categor- ise the approaches into marker based, sensor based or data driven approaches (Pfeifer and B\u00f6hm, 2008). The marker-based approaches are still expected to deliver the highest accuracy. Similar use cases for high accuracy targets arise for easy integration of terrestrial laser scans with other measure- ment technologies such as total station or laser tracker. Also, the long-term observation of single qualified points for example in monitoring or metrology applications can be directly accomplished with targets. For this reason, commercial laser scanning systems provide vendor spe- cific software solutions to detect markers in laser scans from their systems. Although different target designs ex- ist (Jan\u00dfen et al., 2019), checkerboard style targets have been universally adopted across vendors for reasons of cost and versatility. Due to the raster-wise sampling of most common ter- restrial laser scanning systems the back-scattered intens- ity can be represented in a matrix structure (Boehm and Becker, 2007; Sanchez Castillo et al., 2021). This allows for the adoption of robust and widely available image processing algorithms to perform target detec- tion and measurement in 2D. Unfortunately, for non- standard laser scanners, this is not always possible. Some newer generation scanners deliver unordered point clouds \u2217Corresponding author (Ortiz Arteaga et al., 2019). It is not possible to apply image processing algorithms directly to this data type. One possible approach is to project (a portion of) the un- ordered point cloud into a plane and use a 2D approach in the projection plane (Ge and Wunderlich, 2015; Goo et al., 2024). This would then allow to revert to standard image processing. In this work, we want to follow another approach. We formulate the problem of measuring a target\u2019s centre as a template matching problem in 3D. We distinguish the measurement problem from the detection problem. De- tection tries to find the target in the overall scene. Here we are concerned with finding the exact centre of the tar- get when its approximate location is already known. We solve the template matching directly on the raw 3D point cloud data and thus avoid the projection of the data to 2D described above. In unordered 3D data there is no direct equivalent to a cross-correlation. Instead, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) category of algorithms serves a similar purpose for template matching (Besl and McKay, 1992). It is well-known that ICP does not perform well on planar surfaces. Therefore, additional information needs to be taken into account. Using per-point intensity for ICP is a common approach and has been successfully applied to this problem (Liang et al., 2024a). Naively, we can extend the 3D geometry information to form a 4D vector by adding intensity (Feldmar et al., 1997). However, the more recent literature of Park et al. (2017a) suggests a different approach. Two error terms separating geometry and intensity (or colour) are for- mulated and optimised for. This solution is reported to have superior precision over previous approaches. An open implementation of this algorithm is available in the widely adopted Open3D library (Zhou et al., 2018). arXiv:2502.08525v1 [cs.CE] 12 Feb 2025"
