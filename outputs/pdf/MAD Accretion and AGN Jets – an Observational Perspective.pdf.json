  "abstract": ". One of the major open questions related to the production of jets by accreting black holes is: why do sources with similar accretion powers produce so vastly di\ufb00erent jet powers? What conditions are required to make a powerful jet? If jets are powered by the Blandford-Zjanek mechanism, two further parameters control the jet power besides the black hole mass \u2013 black hole spin and the magnetic \ufb02ux threading it. Since highly spinning black holes without jets appear to exist, the jet production e\ufb03ciency may depend on whether the black hole managed to accrete high enough magnetic \ufb02ux in the past. The highest-e\ufb03ciency jets in this picture are launched from magnetically arrested disks (MADs). Here we discuss a method to test this hypothesis using VLBI core-shift measurements to estimate the jet magnetic \ufb02ux. 1. Introduction Understanding what controls the ejection of plasma jets from accreting black holes is a long-standing issue in relativistic astrophysics. The currently favoured theoret- ical picture uses magnetic \ufb01elds as the means of tap- ping rotational energy either from the spinning black hole (Blandford & Znajek 1977) or the inner accretion disk (Blandford & Payne 1982) to power the jets. In recent years, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have provided support to this pic- ture by demonstrating that a rotating black hole is in- deed able to launch stable, high Lorentz factor jets via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism if enough magnetic \ufb02ux accumulates around the black hole either through ad- vection from larger scales or in-situ generation by a dy- namo e\ufb00ect (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011; Liska et al. 2020). One of the major open questions regarding black hole jet production is what creates the wide span of at least four orders of magnitude \u2013 or possibly even a dichotomy \u2013 in the jet power, Pj, for sources with similar accretion disk luminosities and Eddington ratios (Sikora et al. 2007). Black hole mass and accretion rate, \u02d9M, alone cannot de- termine the jet production e\ufb03ciency pj = Pj \u02d9 Mc2 , mean- ing that at least one more parameter is needed (Sikora et al. 2007; Gardner & Done 2014, 2017). In the Blandford- Znajek-mechanism two additional parameters control the jet power: black hole spin and the magnetic \ufb02ux thread- ing the black hole. Hence, it is natural to explore the idea that variation of these two could cause the observed large range in the commonly used proxy for pj, the radio- loudness parameter R = L5/LB, where L5 and LB are the monochromatic luminosities at 5 GHz and 4400\u02daA, respec- tively. Sources with R \u227210 are considered radio-quiet. One possibility is that the wide distribution of R is solely due to the spin distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBH). Tchekhovskoy et al. (2010) showed that it is possible to get jet power variations of \u223c1000 from realistic SMBH spin distributions. On the other hand, the existence of radio-quiet AGN with measured high spins does not \ufb01t well in this model (Reynolds 2021). However, the current spin measurements are model-dependent and can have signi\ufb01cant unaccounted systematics. If the real geometry of the observed AGN cores di\ufb00ers from the as- sumptions of the relativistic re\ufb02ection model, high spin could still be a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for radio- loudness (e.g., Miller & Turner 2013, Done & Jin 2016). Another possible parameter controlling the jet produc- tion e\ufb03ciency is the magnetic \ufb02ux threading the black hole. Sikora & Begelman (2013) have proposed that only those (high spin) sources that manage to accrete enough magnetic \ufb02ux to develop a magnetically arrested disk (MAD; Narayan et al. 2003, Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011), will produce high-power jets and magnetic \ufb02ux thread- ing the black hole would thus be the dominant parameter controlling the radio-loudness of an AGN. Consequently, radio-loudness would depend on the source\u2019s accretion his- tory, since the poloidal magnetic \ufb01eld transport likely de- pends on the details of the accretion process (see e.g., Begelman 2024). Sikora & Begelman (2013) call this the \u201dmagnetic \ufb02ux paradigm\u201d as opposed to the \u201dspin paradigm\u201d. While both parameters, magnetic \ufb02ux and black hole spin, likely play a role in setting the jet power, these \u201dparadigms\u201d refer to the dominant factor in deter- mining the radio-loudness of an AGN. In this paper, we discuss how to constrain the black hole magnetic \ufb02ux over a wide range of R to investigate magnetic \ufb01elds\u2019 role in setting jet production e\ufb03ciency. In Sect. 2, we brie\ufb02y review the observational evidence for the high-pj jets being launched from MAD systems and in Sect. 3, we present a method to estimate the BH magnetic \ufb02ux in sources with low-pj jets."
