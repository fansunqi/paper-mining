  "abstract": "Conventional predictive modeling of parametric relationships in manufacturing processes is limited by the subjectivity of human expertise and intuition on the one hand and by the cost and time of experimental data generation on the other hand. This work addresses this issue by establishing a new Large Language Model (LLM) framework. The novelty lies in combining automatic extraction of process-relevant knowledge embedded in the literature with iterative model refinement based on a small amount of experimental data. This approach is evaluated on three distinct manufacturing processes that are based on machining, deformation, and additive principles. The results show that for the same small experimental data budget the models derived by our framework have unexpectedly high extrapolative performance, often surpassing the capabilities of conventional Machine Learning. Further, our approach eliminates manual generation of initial models or expertise-dependent interpretation of the literature. The results also reveal the importance of the nature of the knowledge extracted from the literature and the significance of both the knowledge extraction and model refinement components.

Introduction Modeling of parametric relationships, i.e., the linkage between process parameters and performance metrics of the process or the product, is critical for control of manufacturing processes. The creation of physics- based simulations for deriving such relationships is often difficult and time-intensive (especially for novel processes) due to incomplete understanding of the underlying multiphysical multidomain interactions and associated constitutive laws. For example, existing models cannot predict the part-scale distribution of grain and void characteristics in electrically-assisted incremental forming of sheet metal due to a lack of models that can capture the non-equilibrium multiaxial thermomechanical conditions imposed on the metal (Bao et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2021; Huang & Log\u00e9, 2016; Shrivastava & Tandon, 2019). Similarly, the ICME Virtual Aluminum Castings (Allison et al., 2006) required models created iteratively across decades before being fully operational. It can also be difficult to construct physics-based models at the appropriate length and time scales. For example, such models can predict post-print sintering in Binder-jet printing on the few- particles scale (Fuchs et al., 2022; Grant et al., 2023; Mao et al., 2023; Mostafaei et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2021; Sadeghi Borujeni et al., 2022) but cannot capture the part-scale spatial distribution of grain size, voids, cracking, and surface finish for complex geometries. Similarly, linking the nanoscale optical intensification between nanoparticle pairs to part-scale thermal modeling for millions of nanoparticles in printed circuits requires a scaling law, the formulation of which has taken many years and is still incomplete (Cleeman et al., 2022; Devaraj et al., 2020; Devaraj & Malhotra, 2019; Devaraj et al., 2021; Jahangir et al., 2020). The creation of such physics-based models is also affected by subjective interpretations of literature by the"
