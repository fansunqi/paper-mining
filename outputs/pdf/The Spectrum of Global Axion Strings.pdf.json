  "title": "The Spectrum of Global Axion Strings.pdf",
  "abstract": "Predicting their mass requires a precise knowledge of how axions are produced from the decay of topological defects in the early Universe that are inevitably formed. In this contribution, we present recent results on the analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from global strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the PQ field on a static lattice [1]. We highlight several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects; some of which could explain the discrepancy in the current literature. Taking these uncertainties into account and performing the extrapolation to cosmologically relevant string tensions, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted to be in the range of 95 \ud835\udf07eV \u2272\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\u2272450 \ud835\udf07eV, which will be probed by some of the next generation direct detection experiments. 2nd Training School and General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106) 11-14 June and 3-6 September, 2024 Ljubljana (Slovenia) and Istanbul (Turkey) \u2217Speaker \u00a9 Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). https://pos.sissa.it/ arXiv:2502.02398v1 [hep-ph] 4 Feb 2025"
