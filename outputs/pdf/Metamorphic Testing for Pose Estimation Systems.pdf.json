  "abstract": "\u2014Pose estimation systems are used in a variety of fields, from sports analytics to livestock care. Given their potential impact, it is paramount to systematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a complex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling necessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus allows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions that more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc test dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to their application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also present a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common challenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to evaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE by applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation system, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline numerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose estimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand labelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the faults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.

INTRODUCTION Pose Estimation Systems has applications in medicine [1], sign language recognition [2] and high stakes sports events [3], requiring them to be well-tested in order to provide a sub- stantiated assessment of the correct behaviour when applied to sensitive domains. Such systems need to perform correctly and as expected under a variety of conditions. This work aims to provide practitioners with a means of assessing this. In this work we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework to test pose estimation systems without the signif- icant cost of manual data labelling. Additionally, we propose a non exhaustive set of metamorphic rules for MET-POSE, including flexible metrics to assess violations. These rules allow practitioners to apply various commonly encountered This work was supported in part with the financial support of grant 13/RC/2094 2 to Lero - the Research Ireland Research Centre for Software. image changes and can easily be extended by users, should they want to explore different aspects of the system. We apply MET-POSE to Mediapipe Hollistic [4], a widely used state-of-the-art pose estimation system, on datasets from the literature used to train and assess human pose estimation systems in different domains. We show that our proposed framework can find numerous faulty outputs from the system. Results show that MET-POSE provides results on par with classic, human annotated ground truth-based testing on the FLIC dataset. Furthermore, we illustrate how analysis of the results can highlight elements of the input that impact the system\u2019s performance. Such analysis can then help practi- tioners better understand the settings under which the system functions properly, and can thus be used with confidence. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. First, Section II provides an overview of the context and concepts that underpin this work. Next, Section III describes our proposed metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems, and Section IV describes a non-exhaustive set of possible metamorphic relations for this system. Section V de- scribes the experiments performed to evaluate the framework, and Section VI describes and analyses the results of these experiments. Section VII gives an overview of related work, while Section VIII describes threats to the validity of this work, and steps taken to address them. Finally, Section IX concludes the paper and proposes avenues for future work. II. BACKGROUND This section provides an overview and definition of the con- cepts used in this work. First, Section II-A defines human pose estimation systems, which the proposed framework tests, then Section II-B defines challenges specific to testing Machine Learning (ML) systems, and Section II-C explains the idea of metamorphic testing, the basis of the proposed framework. A. Pose Estimation Pose estimation is the task of estimating the locations of different landmarks on a subject from images or video frames, with the overall aim of providing an overview of their pose. This task is important to a wide variety of fields including human activity recognition [5], sign language recognition [2], and sports analytics [3]. It is typically solved using DL- based regression algorithms which estimate the coordinates of each body part. One of the most common open-source arXiv:2502.09460v1 [cs.SE] 13 Feb 2025"
