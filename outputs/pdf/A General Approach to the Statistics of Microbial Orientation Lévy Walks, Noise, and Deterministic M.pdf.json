Mitchella\u2021 Univeristy of California: Merceda 5200 Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343, and Bucknell Universityb One Dent Dr, Lewisburg, PA 17837 (Dated: February 20, 2025) Microbial motion is typically analyzed by simplified models in which trajectories exhibit straight runs (perhaps with added Gaussian noise) followed by random, discrete tumbling events. We present the results of a statistical analysis of the angular dynamics for four different swimming microbes: tumbling and smooth-swimming strains of Bacillus subtilis and two Eukaryotic algae, Tetraselmis suecica and Euglena gracilis. We show that the angular statistics closely resemble a Voigt profile, the convolution of a Gaussian (L\u00b4evy index \u03b1 = 2) and Lorentzian (L\u00b4evy index \u03b1 = 1) distribution. This distribution is ubiquitous for all four microbes. Rather than modeling tumbling as a discrete process, we model tumbling dynamics as a continuous process: L\u00b4evy flights in the orientational dynamics using a Lorentzian noise model. This model is analytically solvable. Each individual microbe trajectory has both stochastic behavior (noise) and varying deterministic behavior, such as helices of different sizes and frequencies and circular arcs with different radii. We model the distribution of different deterministic behavior via an ensemble theory. The deterministic behavior (e.g., circular arcs) comes from physical observations of the swimming behavior and explains many of the qualitative features in the data that cannot be explained by a pure noise model. From this theory, we estimate the strength of Lorentzian noise, the physical rotational diffusion constant, and some relevant parameters relating to the distributions of deterministic behavior. This analysis shows that in some cases Gaussian noise is not the dominant process responsible for the angular statistics following a Voigt profile. I. Introduction Research interest in active matter systems has grown rapidly in recent years. Active matter covers a broad range of nonequilibrium physical systems. Some of the systems of great interest in this field include the behavior of self-propelled particles and active diffusion. Examples of these systems include swimming microbes [1\u20134] and self-propelled Janus particles [5, 6]. L\u00b4evy walks have been used to model many phenomena in physical and biological systems, such as the search patterns of albatross, bumblebees, and deer [7], chaotic advection of passive tracer particles in flows [8], E. coli exploring its environment [9], and human mobility pat- terns [10]. There are also processes that are reminiscent of L\u00b4evy walks, such as bacterial hopping and trapping in pourous media [11]. L\u00b4evy walks turn out to be a better search strategy in many scenarios than simple diffusion due to the super-diffusive behavior of the walks [12]. L\u00b4evy walks are trajectories with jumps defined by L\u00b4evy-\u03b1 stable distributions, where the probability of the jump length \u2113is P(\u2113) \u223c\u2113\u2212(\u03b1+1). L\u00b4evy walks are charac- terized by 0 < \u03b1 < 2. These distributions have infinite variance for \u03b1 < 2 and undefined mean for \u03b1 \u22641. They are characterized by heavy tails, meaning they have a high probability of making arbitrarily large jumps. In contrast, if the L\u00b4evy index \u03b1 = 2, we get a Gaussian \u2217twhitney@ucmerced.edu \u2020 tsolomon@bucknell.edu \u2021 kmitchell@ucmerced.edu distribution with well defined mean and variance. Microbial motion is often modeled via a run-and- tumble mechanism, with random discrete tumbling events interspersed between nearly straight runs. We propose a different perspective on microbial dynamics by modeling the orientation via a continuous L\u00b4evy walk pro- cess. We test this model experimentally by monitoring the orientation of four different non-interacting microbial populations in two dimensions. This model closely repro- duces the experimental orientation statistics of these en- sembles. In addition to stochastic processes, microbes ex- hibit a range of deterministic swimming behavior. Exam- ples of these deterministic behaviors include helices [13] and circular arcs [14] (near solid surfaces). The varia- tions in these deterministic behaviors affect the statistics in these systems. To our knowledge, the range of these behaviors has not been modeled in the literature. There- fore, in addition to the stochastic dynamics, we include such deterministic behavior as well. The paper is divided into several sections. Section II covers the background physics and current models used in the literature. Section III outlines the experiment and data collection for several different microbes. Section IV covers the statistical methods and applies them to the experimental data. Section V outlines the proposed theory, starting from the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the orientational dynamics. It then progresses into a Fokker-Planck equation for the system. Finally, it outlines the ensemble theory for randomly distributed drift parameters and addresses physically relevant appli- cations of the theory. Section VI discusses the application of this theory to the experimental data. Finally Sec. VII arXiv:2502.13304v1 [physics.bio-ph] 18 Feb 2025"
