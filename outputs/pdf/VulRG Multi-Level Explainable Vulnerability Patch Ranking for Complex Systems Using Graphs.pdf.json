  "abstract": "The growing number of vulnerabilities, coupled with resource constraints, makes addressing every vulnerability impractical, thereby rendering effective prioritization essential. However, current risk prioritization methods, which often rely on expert judgment or focus solely on exploit likelihood and consequences, lack the granularity and adaptability needed for complex systems. This paper presents a novel graph-based framework for patch prioritization that optimizes security in complex systems by integrating diverse data sources and metrics into a universally applicable model. We introduce refined risk metrics that enable detailed assessments at the component, asset, and system levels. The framework employs two key graphs: a network communication graph to model potential attack paths and identify the shortest routes to critical assets, and a system dependency graph to capture risk propagation from exploited vulnerabilities across interconnected components. By defining asset criticality and component dependency rules, our approach systematically assesses and mitigates risks. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates our framework\u2019s superior accuracy in vulnerability patch ranking, with enhanced explainability. This framework not only advances vulnerability management but also sets the stage for future research in adaptive cybersecurity strategies.
