  "abstract": ". In this paper an extensive database of SPARC H-modes confinement predictions has been provided, to assess its variability with respect to few input assumptions. The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA framework, using the quasi-linear model TGLF SAT2, including electromagnetic effects, for the core transport, and a neural network trained on EPED simulations to predict the pedestal height and width self-consistently. The database has been developed starting from two SPARC H-mode discharges (12.2 T, i.e. Primary Reference Discharge or PRD, and 8 T, i.e. reduced field) and permuting 4 input parameters (W concentration, DT mixture concentration, temperature ratio at top of pedestal and deviation of pedestal pressure from the EPED prediction), to perform a sensitivity study. For the PRD a scan of auxiliary input power (ion cyclotron heating) has been performed up to 25MW, to keep highly radiative plasmas above the LH power threshold as predicted by Martin and Schmidtmayr power scalings. A scan of pedestal density has then been performed for both PRD and 8T databases. ptop/pEP ED and Ti/Te at top of pedestal showed the biggest impact on the fusion gain. Significant variation is observed across the database, highlighting the importance of sensitivity studies. Below a certain W concentration, the 12T database shows that Q > 5 is consistently achieved for full-field H-modes with 11 MW of auxiliary power, and values of Q > 2 are assured when increasing the input power to keep the plasma in H-mode. The 8T database demonstrates that SPARC can access a Q > 1 operational window with low W concentration, making it a potentially interesting scenario for obtaining breakeven conditions. 1. Introduction The prediction of plasma fusion performance is crucial for both current experiments and future devices. Beyond revealing fascinating physics, it provides a key benchmark for assessing research progress and validating the reliability of modeling approaches. arXiv:2502.00187v1 [physics.plasm-ph] 31 Jan 2025"
