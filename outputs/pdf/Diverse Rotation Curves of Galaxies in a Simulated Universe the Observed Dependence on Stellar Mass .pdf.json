  "abstract": "We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the rotation curves of galaxies in the local universe. To do that, we first select the galaxies with 9.4 < log (Mstar/M\u2299) < 11.5 to make a sample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the two-dimensional line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the rotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region (Rt < r < 3 \u00d7 rhalf,\u2217). The outer slopes of the simulated galaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar mass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as galaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The outer slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter fraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study demonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on morphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological simulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in shaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study could serve as an important testbed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies back in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the diverse rotation curves.

INTRODUCTION A galaxy rotation curve shows how the rotation veloc- ity of stars or gas in a galaxy varies with the distance from the center of the galaxy. A galaxy rotation curve is an important tool for studying the internal structure of a galaxy (Oort 1940; Sofue & Rubin 2001a). The square of the amplitude of rotational velocity is proportional to the enclosed mass, so the curve also provides a way to map the mass distribution in a galaxy including invisible dark matter (Rubin & Ford 1970; Sofue 2017). One interesting thing from recent integral field spec- troscopic observations of galaxies is that the shape of rotation curves of galaxies is diverse (Genzel et al. 2017; Tiley et al. 2019; Genzel et al. 2020). This diversity Corresponding author: Ho Seong Hwang hhwang@astro.snu.ac.kr might be attributed to dark matter, which constitutes the majority of the mass in the outer regions of galax- ies (Lovell et al. 2018)1. In detail, the amount of dark matter and the radial profile of dark matter density can vary depending on different histories of mass accretion in galaxies. It has been observed that high-z spiral galax- ies have a decreasing rotation curve that differs from the flat rotation curve of local spiral galaxies (Genzel et al. 2017; Lang et al. 2017; Genzel et al. 2020). By de- termining the cause of this z-dependent rotation curve shape, we can learn how dark matter affects the rotation curve itself and other galaxy properties influencing the rotation curve. This means that unraveling the cause of 1 It should be noted that there are also other ways to explain galaxy rotation curves without introducing dark matter (e.g. Milgrom 1983; Yoon et al. 2023) arXiv:2502.01625v1 [astro-ph.GA] 3 Feb 2025"
