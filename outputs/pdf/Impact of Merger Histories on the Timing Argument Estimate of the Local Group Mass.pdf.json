  "abstract": "The timing argument (TA) aims to find the total mass of the Local Group (LG) from the relative motions of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31). However, the classical TA always overestimates the LG mass, presumably because it does not account for the hierarchical scenario and other interactions, such as that with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We focused on the impact of M31\u2019s recent major merger by using three merger models to find the peculiar motion of M31 within the simple two-body, point-mass scenario of the TA. We find that the merger correction affects the TA mass by plus or minus 10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large uncertainties. If we consider an M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA mass by 10-15%, to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as reported in the literature, the TA mass is consistent with the LG mass from Hubble-Lema\u00eetre flow. Galaxies are believed to have experienced about 16 major mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers had a similar impact on the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass would be 0.85+0.65 \u22120.37, and such a TA mass is consistent with all the LG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with findings that used LG analogues in cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited by the hierarchical scenario, since it is not possible to track the progenitors of both the MW and M31 through so many mergers. We conclude that the MW\u2013M31 dynamical system is far too complex to be modelled as a simple two-body point-mass system. Key words.

Introduction The Local Group (LG) is dominated by two large spiral galax- ies, the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31). One approach to finding their total mass is the so-called timing argument (TA), which relies on the fact that M31 is observed to be approaching us in the current epoch, while all other large galaxies have been moving away from us since the Big Bang. The two galaxies must have been moving away from each other during the Big Bang, and their gravity has since been bring- ing them towards each other. So, solving this simple two-body system using the current observed distance, velocity, and time would give us the total mass of the two galaxies. However, this classic calculation (Kahn & Woltjer 1959; Lynden-Bell 1981; van der Marel et al. 2012) consistently predicts a much higher mass (\u223c4 \u22126 \u00d7 1012M\u2299) than the LG mass (\u223c2 \u22123 \u00d7 1012M\u2299) found from the sum of the highest mass estimates of the two galaxies from their internal or satellite dynamics (Eilers et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2021; Chemin et al. 2009; Corbelli et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2024; Watkins et al. 2010) or the dynamics of the LG as a whole (Pe\u00f1arrubia et al. 2014; Diaz et al. 2014). Previ- ous attempts to reconcile the TA mass with the LG mass had to deviate from the two-body point-mass scenario by incorporating the impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the MW (Pe\u00f1arrubia et al. 2015; Benisty 2024) or by using cosmologi- cal simulations to take the growth of the extended halos of the two galaxies over time into account (Sawala et al. 2023; Benisty 2024). \u22c6E-mail: istiak-hossain.akib@obspm.fr However, the two-body point-mass scenario is affected by major merger events experienced by these galaxies in the past. In particular, we focus on the recent major merger experienced by M31, which is needed to reproduce the observational properties of M31 and its outskirts (Hammer et al. 2018, 2025; D\u2019Souza & Bell 2018; Bhattacharya et al. 2023; Tsakonas et al. 2024). Sim- ulations by Hammer et al. (2018, 2025) indicate that this merger started 7-10 Gyr ago and ended 2-3 Gyr ago. The observed posi- tion and velocity of M31 therefore have an additional component due to this merger, while the TA attributes the observation com- pletely to the mutual gravity of the two galaxies. In this Letter we show how this merger impacts the TA mass estimation. In Sect. 2 we recalculate the TA mass by correcting the global motion of M31 due to the merger using three M31 merger models. Section 3 shows that adding the merger correc- tion to the reported LMC corrections can make the TA mass compatible with the LG mass, and we propose a correction re- lated to the entire merger history of the two galaxies. 2. Timing argument with the M31 merger correction We used M31 merger models 288 and 336 from Hammer et al. (2018) and model 371 from Hammer et al. (2025). All three models have similar initial conditions and reproduce the ob- served properties of M31. In these merger models, a relatively light secondary galaxy, referred to as the incoming galaxy in this Letter, merges into a primary galaxy that is about four times more massive, which we refer to as the proto-M31. Model 371 is almost a copy of model 288, but the dark matter mass of both progenitors is reduced by factor of 1.6 in order to accurately fit Article number, page 1 of 5 arXiv:2502.13203v1 [astro-ph.GA] 18 Feb 2025"
