  "abstract": "A personal recollection of early years in lattice gauge theory with a bias towards chiral symmetry and lattice fermions.\u2020 1 Prologue September 1969, at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Amsterdam (ITFA), I became a PhD student of S.A. (Sieg) Wouthuysen. Recent developments in the field of high-energy physics (HEP) had his attention somewhat from a distance, for his own research he was more interested in fundamentals. Sieg\u2019s students were free to choose research topics and he was very helpful supporting them. In 1970 I was working on my own while also trying to understand incom- ing HEP literature with fellow student G.J. (Gerbrand) Komen1. Information about what was going on in those days came from several sources. In the eas- ily accessible library one eagerly perused a weekly pile of new preprints and also new issues of journals. Inevitably this implied a delay in the stream of current developments. Topics enough: Regge poles, current algebras, effective Lagrangians, partons, scale and conformal invariance, renormalization group . . . With Gerbrand I studied deep inelastic scattering, partons and even confor- mal invariance. Another stimulating source was the National Seminar instigated by M.J.G. Veltman (Utrecht University) and organised in turn about every six weeks by the HEP theory groups of the Dutch universities.
