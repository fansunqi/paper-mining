  "title": "Does Acceleration Always Degrade Quantum Entanglement for Tetrapartite Unruh-DeWitt Detectors.pdf",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the Unruh effect completely destroys quantum entanglement and coher- ence of bipartite states, as modeled by entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors. But does the Unruh effect have a different impact on quantum entanglement of multipartite states within this framework? In this paper, we investigate the in\ufb02uence of the Unruh effect on 1 \u22123 entanglement in the context of entangled tetra- partite Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We \ufb01nd that quantum entanglement of tetrapartite W state \ufb01rst decreases to a minimum value and then increases to a \ufb01xed value with the growth of the acceleration. This indicates that the Unruh effect can, under certain conditions, enhance quantum entanglement. In other words, the Unruh effect plays a dual role in the behavior of quantum entanglement\u2014both diminishing and enhancing it. This discovery challenges and overturns the traditional view that the Unruh effect is solely detrimental to quantum entanglement and coherence in entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, offering a fresh and profound perspective on its impact.
