  "abstract": "Hypergraph states are a special kind of multipartite states encoded by hypergraphs. They play a signi\ufb01cant role in quantum error correction, measurement\u2013 based quantum computation, quantum non locality and entanglement. In a series of two papers, we introduce and study calibrated hypergraph states, a broad generalization of weighted hypergraph states codi\ufb01ed by hypergraphs equipped with calibrations, an ample extension of weightings. We propose as a guiding principle that a constructive theory of hypergraph states must be based on a categorical framework for hypergraphs on one hand and multi qudit states on the other constraining hypergraph states enough to render the determination of their general structure possible. In this \ufb01rst paper, we introduce graded \u2126monads, concrete Pro categories isomorphic to the Pro category \u2126of \ufb01nite von Neumann ordinals and equipped with an associative and unital graded multiplication, and their morphisms, maps of \u2126monads compatible with their monadic structure. We then show that both calibrated hypergraphs and multi qudit states naturally organize in graded \u2126monads. In this way, we lay the foundation for the construction of calibrated hypergraph state map as a special morphism of these \u2126 monads in the companion paper. MSC: 05C65 81P99 81Q99"
