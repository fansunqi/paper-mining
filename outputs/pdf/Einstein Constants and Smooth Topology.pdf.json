  "abstract": "It was \ufb01rst shown in [10] that certain high-dimensional smooth closed manifolds admit pairs of Einstein metrics with Ricci curvatures of opposite sign. After reviewing subsequent progress that has been made on this topic, we then prove various related results, with the ultimate goal of stimulating further research on associated questions. 1 Introduction A Riemannian metric g is said to be Einstein if its Ricci curvature, considered as a function on the unit tangent bundle, is constant. This is of course equivalent to requiring that the Ricci tensor r of g satisfy r = \u03bbg (1) for some real number \u03bb. In the original context of general relativity, where the metric is taken to be Lorentzian rather than Riemannian, equation (1) is called the Einstein vacuum equation with cosmological constant. In fact, Einstein did brie\ufb02y consider the possibility that the constant \u03bb in (1) might be non-zero, but he eventually [22, p. 44] came to consider this idea to be \u201cthe biggest blunder of his life.\u201d It must therefore surely be considered to be amusingly ironic that we mathematicians have acquired the habit of calling \u03bb the Einstein constant of a Riemannian metric g satisfying (1). \u2217Supported in part by NSF grant DMS-2203572. 1"
