  "title": "The Impact of Wind Accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems.pdf",
  "abstract": "The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to binary systems has long struggled to produce reliable mass accretion efficiencies when the stellar wind velocity of the donor star is smaller than the orbital velocity of the accretor. This limitation is significant in symbiotic systems where such conditions exist. Recently, our group introduced a geometric correction to the standard implementation of the BHL model that demonstrates improved agreement with numerical simulations. The present work investigates the impact of this new implementation on the evolution of symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M\u2299white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M\u2299. The primary star is evolved using the mesa stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using rebound. The analysis focuses on the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. Our results show that the choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.

Studying accretion in symbiotic systems is crucial, because they are very likely the progenitors of unique objects, such as Barium stars (Bidelman & Keenan 1951) and carbon- and \ud835\udc60-element-enhanced metal-poor stars (Beers & Christlieb 2005). Besides cataclysmic variables, symbiotic systems also produce nova-like events and are potential progenitors of type Ia supernovae with cosmological implications (see Mukai 2017; Chomiuk et al. 2021). The accretion process in symbiotic systems can be studied indi- rectly through various types of observations, such as the rotation of accretion discs (e.g., Leedjarv et al. 1994; Robinson et al. 1994; Za- manov et al. 2024), associated X-ray emission (e.g., Toal\u00e1 et al. 2023; Vasquez-Torres et al. 2024; Zhekov & Tomov 2019), or the flickering effect observed mainly in optical wavelengths (e.g., Sokoloski et al. 2001; Gromadzki et al. 2006; Merc et al. 2024). Despite these in- sights, the specific mechanisms by which material from the late-type companion is accreted onto the WD are still under investigation. \u2605E-mail: r.maldonado@irya.unam.mx For decades, it has been widely accepted that accretion through wind capture in a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL)-like scenario (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939; Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Bondi 1952) is not applica- ble to symbiotic systems, particularly when the velocity of the stellar wind (\ud835\udc63w) of the mass-losing, late-type star is lower than the orbital velocity (\ud835\udc63o) of the accreting WD (e.g., Boffin 2015; Hansen et al. 2016). For \ud835\udc63w < \ud835\udc63o, the standard implementation of the BHL formal- ism in binary stars overestimates the resulting mass accretion rate, predicting in some cases a non-physical value exceeding unity. This challenge has been extensively discussed in several numerical sim- ulations (see, e.g., Huarte-Espinosa et al. 2013; Malfait et al. 2024; Saladino et al. 2019; Theuns et al. 1996, and references therein). However, the problem has persisted since theoretical works still turn to BHL-like prescriptions to study accreting WDs given its simplicity (see, e.g., Chen et al. 2018; Vathachira et al. 2024). Several groups tried to alleviate the mass accretion efficiency problem by including arbitrary efficiency factors to the BHL formalism (e.g., Nagae et al. 2004; Malfait et al. 2024; Richards et al. 2024; Saladino & Pols 2019; Li et al. 2023) or cut-off values (e.g., Saladino et al. 2019), and those recipes are included in population synthesis studies (see, e.g., Hurley et al. 2002; Izzard et al. 2009; Osborn et al. 2024; Andrews et al. 2024). To address this issue, Tejeda & Toal\u00e1 (2024) (hereinafter Paper I) have recently presented analytical modifications to the standard \u00a9 2025 The Authors arXiv:2502.11325v1 [astro-ph.SR] 17 Feb 2025"
