  "abstract": ". This paper derives new maximal inequalities for empirical processes associ- ated with separately exchangeable random arrays. For any \ufb01xed index dimension K \u22651, we establish a global maximal inequality that bounds the q-th moment, for any q \u2208[1, \u221e), of the supremum of these processes. In addition, we obtain a re\ufb01ned local maximal in- equality that controls the \ufb01rst absolute moment of the supremum. Both results are proved for a general pointwise measurable class of functions. 1. Introduction This paper develops novel local and global maximal inequalities for empirical pro- cesses of separately exchangeable arrays, where the index dimension K \u2208N is \ufb01xed but arbitrary and the empirical processes are de\ufb01ned on general classes of functions. Separately exchangeable (SE) arrays are widely utilised in modelling multiway-clustered random variables and/or K-partite networks in econometrics and statistics (see, for ex- ample, Davezies, D\u2019Haultf\u0153uille, and Guyonvarch 2021; MacKinnon, Nielsen, and Webb 2021; Menzel 2021; Chiang, Kato, Ma, and Sasaki 2022; Graham 2024). Maximal inequalities are powerful tools that are indispensable in the analysis of numer- ous econometric and statistical problems. They have proven crucial in areas such as semi- parametric estimation and debiased machine learning (e.g. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Kato 2015; Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Du\ufb02o, Hansen, Newey, and Robins 2018), quan- tile and instrumental variable quantile regression (see, for instance, Kato, Galvao Jr, and Montes-Rojas 2012; Chetverikov, Larsen, and Palmer 2016; Galvao, Gu, and Volgushev 2020), condi- tional mode estimation (Ota, Kato, and Hara 2019), testing many moment inequalities (Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, and Kato, 2019), adversarial learning (Kaji, Manresa, and Pouliot 2023), targeted minimum loss-based estimation (van der Laan 2017), and density estima- tion for dyadic data (Cattaneo, Feng, and Underwood 2024), to name but a few. Despite promising recent advances in the studies of SE arrays and its potential bene\ufb01ts for statistical inference and econometric applications, the theoretical literature on maximal inequalities for SE arrays remains rather scarce. In particular, no general global maximal inequality is available. While certain global maximal inequalities have been established First draft: 14 February 2025. I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Bruce E. Hansen for his encour- agement and comments, which has been instrumental in the preparation of this manuscript. 1"
