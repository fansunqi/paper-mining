  "abstract": ". The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and static Euler equations are considered. We \ufb01nd that there exist in\ufb01nite non-trivial regular solutions of in- compressible static Euler equations with given boundary conditions. Moreover there exist random solutions of incompressible static Euler equations. Provided Reynolds number is large enough and time variable t goes to in\ufb01nity, these random solutions of static Euler equations are the path limits of corresponding Navier-Stokes \ufb02ows. But the double limits of these Navier-Stokes \ufb02ows do not exist. These phenomena reveal randomness and turbulence of incompressible \ufb02uids. Therefore these solutions are called turbulent solutions. Here some typing models without Prandtl layer are given. 1. Introduction The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R3 are given by (1.1) ut \u2212\u03bd\u2206u + (u \u00b7 \u2207)u + \u2207P = 0, (1.2) \u2207\u00b7 u = 0, where u = u(t, x) = \u0000u1(t, x), u2(t, x), u3(t, x) \u0001 and P = P(t, x) stand for the unknown velocity vector \ufb01eld of \ufb02uid and its pressure, \u03bd > 0 is the coe\ufb03cient of viscosity. Here x = (x1, x2, x3), \u2207= (\u22021, \u22022, \u22023) and \u2202j = \u2202 \u2202xj (j = 1, 2, 3). Taking curl with equation (1.1), we have (1.3) \u03c9t \u2212\u03bd\u2206\u03c9 + (u \u00b7 \u2207)\u03c9 \u2212(\u03c9 \u00b7 \u2207)u = 0. Here vorticity \u03c9 = (\u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93) and \u03c9(t, x) =\u2207\u00d7 u(t, x). (1.4) The incompressible static Euler equations in R3 are given by (1.5) (u \u00b7 \u2207)u + \u2207P = 0, (1.6) \u2207\u00b7 u = 0. By taking curl, the equation (1.5) is equivalent to (1.7) (u \u00b7 \u2207)\u03c9 \u2212(\u03c9 \u00b7 \u2207)u = 0. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 35Q30, 76D05, 76F02, 37L20.
