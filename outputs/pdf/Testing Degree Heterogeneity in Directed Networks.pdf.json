  "abstract": "We are concerned with the likelihood ratio tests in the p0 model for testing degree heterogeneity in directed networks. It is an exponential family distribution on directed graphs with the out-degree sequence and the in-degree sequence as naturally sufficient statistics. For two growing dimensional null hypotheses: a specified null H0 : \u03b8i = \u03b80 i for i = 1, . . . , r and a homogenous null H0 : \u03b81 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03b8r, we reveal high dimensional Wilks\u2019 phenomena that the normalized log-likelihood ratio statistic, [2{\u2113(b\u03b8)\u2212\u2113(b\u03b8 0)}\u2212r]/(2r)1/2, converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution as r \u2192\u221e. Here, \u2113(\u03b8) is the log-likelihood function, b\u03b8 is the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of \u03b8, and b\u03b8 0 is the restricted MLE for \u03b8 under the null H0. For the homogenous null H0 : \u03b81 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03b8r with a fixed r, we establish the Wilks-type theorem that 2{\u2113(b\u03b8)\u2212\u2113(b\u03b8 0)} converges in distribution to a chi-square distribution with r\u22121 degrees of freedom as n \u2192\u221e, not depending on the nuisance parameters. These results extend a recent work by Yan et al. (2023) to directed graphs. Simulation studies and real data analyses illustrate the theoretical results.
