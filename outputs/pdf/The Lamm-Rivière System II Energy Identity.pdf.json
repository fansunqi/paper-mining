In this paper, we establish an angular energy quantization for the following fourth order inhomogeneous Lamm-Rivi\u00e8re system \u22062u = \u2206(V \u00b7 \u2207u) + div(w\u2207u) + W \u00b7 \u2207u + f in dimension four, with an inhomogeneous term f \u2208L log L.

Introduction and main results Let B1 \u2282R4 be the unit ball and (N, h) be a l-dimensional, smooth, compact Riemann- ian manifold without boundary, that is isometrically embedded into an Euclidean space Rn of dimension n. Consider the following second order energy functionals for maps u \u2208W 2,2(B1, N): Eext(u) = Z B1 |\u2206u|2dx and Eint(u) = Z B1 |(\u2206u)T |2dx, where (\u2206u)T is the orthogonal projection of \u2206u into the tangent space of N at point u, TuN. Critical points of Eext (or Eint) are called extrinsic (or intrinsic, respectively) biharmonic maps. Note that the notion of extrinsic biharmonic maps may depend on the isometric embedding of (N, h) into Rn, and biharmonic maps are natural higher order extensions of harmonic maps. The Euler-Lagrange equations for critical points of Eext and Eint are fourth order nonlinear elliptic systems with supercritical nonlinearities. For instance, an extrinsic biharmonic map u \u2208 W 2,2(B1, N) is a weak solution of \u22062u \u2212\u2206(B(u)(\u2207u, \u2207u)) \u22122\u2207\u00b7 \u27e8\u2206u, \u2207P(u)\u27e9+ \u27e8\u2206(P(u)), \u2206u\u27e9= 0, where B(\u00b7)(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the second fundamental form of N \u0592\u2192Rn, and P(y) is the orthogonal projection of Rn into the tangent space TyN for y \u2208N. These equations are critical in dimension four. Chang-Wang-Yang [2] initiated the study of regularity theory of extrinsic biharmonic maps from a m-dimensional domain \u2126\u2282Rm to an Euclidean sphere and established their smoothness when m = 4. Shortly after, Wang developed a regularity theory of both extrinsic and intrinsic biharmonic maps into any smooth compact Riemannian manifold in a series of papers [28, 27, 26] via the method of Coulomb moving frames. Motivated by the celebrated result of Rivi\u00e8re [19], Lamm and Rivi\u00e8re [11] introduced a class of fourth order critical elliptic systems (see (1.1) below with f = 0), including both extrinsic and intrinsic biharmonic maps, and proved the continuity of weak solutions; see also Scheven [22] for regularity results in supercritical dimensions.
