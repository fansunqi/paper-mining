  "abstract": ". Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancement is heavily dependent on access to large-scale, high-quality training data. However, in spe- cialized domains such as healthcare, data acquisition faces significant constraints due to privacy regulations, ethical considerations, and lim- ited availability. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solu- tion, conventional approaches typically require substantial real data for training generative models. The emergence of large-scale prompt-based models presents new opportunities for synthetic data generation with- out direct access to protected data. However, crafting effective prompts for domain-specific data generation remains challenging, and manual prompt engineering proves insufficient for achieving output with suffi- cient precision and authenticity. We review recent developments in au- tomatic prompt optimization, following PRISMA guidelines. We analyze six peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024 that focus on automatic data-free prompt optimization methods. Our analysis reveals three approaches: feedback-driven, error-based, and control-theoretic. Al- though all approaches demonstrate promising capabilities in prompt re- finement and adaptation, our findings suggest the need for an integrated framework that combines complementary optimization techniques to en- hance synthetic data generation while minimizing manual intervention. We propose future research directions toward developing robust, itera- tive prompt optimization frameworks capable of improving the quality of synthetic data. This advancement can be particularly crucial for sen- sitive fields and in specialized domains where data access is restricted, potentially transforming how we approach synthetic data generation for AI development. 1 Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are rapidly transforming diverse sectors and fundamentally reshape operational paradigms across industries. The pro- found impact of these systems is critically dependent on the reliability of their decision-making capabilities. This reliability is fundamentally tied to the AI- models\u2019 predictive capabilities which critically depends on two key dimensions: \u22c6These authors contributed equally. arXiv:2502.03078v2 [cs.HC] 8 Feb 2025"
