  "abstract": "Infodemics are a threat to public health, arising from multiple interacting phe- nomena occurring both online and offline. The continuous feedback loops between the digital information ecosystem and offline contingencies make infodemics par- ticularly challenging to define operationally, measure, and eventually model in quantitative terms. In this study, we present evidence of the effect of various epidemic-related variables on the dynamics of infodemics, using a robust mod- elling framework applied to data from 30 countries across diverse income groups. We use WHO COVID-19 surveillance data on new cases and deaths, vaccination data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, infodemic data (volume of public conversations and social media content) from the WHO EARS platform, and Google Trends data to represent information demand. Our findings show that new deaths are the strongest predictor of the infodemic, measured as new document production including social media content and public conversa- tions, and that the epidemic burden in neighbouring countries appears to have a greater impact on document production than the domestic one. Building on these results, we propose a taxonomy that highlights country-specific discrepancies 1 arXiv:2501.19016v1 [cs.SI] 31 Jan 2025"
