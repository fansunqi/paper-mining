  "title": "High-dimensional Random Landscapes from Typical to Large Deviations.pdf",
  "abstract": "As an example, we consider a high- dimensional inference problem in two forms: matrix denoising (Case 1) and tensor denoising (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high- dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two Cases. We dis- cuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape prob- lem and Large Deviation Theory. CONTENTS I. Random landscapes in high dimension, and these notes 2 A. The landscape program 3 B.
