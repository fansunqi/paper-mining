  "abstract": "Neutron reflectivity is a powerful technique for probing density profiles in films, with applications across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, challenges arise when dealing with samples characterized by high roughness, unknown scattering length density (SLD) with low contrast, very thin layers, or complex multi- layered structures, that cannot be uniquely resolved due to the phase problem. Incorporating a magnetic reference layer (MRL) and using polarized neutron reflectivity improves sensitivity and modeling accuracy by providing complementary information. In this study, we introduce a quantitative way to compare MRL systems in a model-free way. We apply this approach to demonstrate that CoTi alloys offer a superior solution as an MRL compared to the commonly used Fe or Ni-based MRLs. The low nuclear and magnetic scattering length densities of CoTi significantly enhance sensitivity, making it particularly advantageous for soft matter research. Furthermore, the tunable Co vs Ti ratio allows for optimization of the SLDs to achieve maximum sensitivity, establishing CoTi as a highly effective choice for MRL applications. The applied simulation framework for optimizing MRL sensitivity to a specific materials system and research question is a generic approach that can be used prior to growing the MRL for a given experiment. Introduction Neutron Reflectometry (NR) is a versatile technique for analyzing the depth profile of thin films and layered materials, i.e. their thickness, density, and roughness. It's particularly impactful in soft matter research, where it probes complex systems like polymers, lipids, and biological macromolecules under near-natural conditions.1\u20135 NR's ability to investigate interfaces and thin films in soft materials reveals crucial insights into phenomena such as polymer dynamics, protein adsorption, and lipid membrane organization.2,6\u20138 Its sensitivity to water is also key for studying hydration effects in biological and soft matter contexts, making NR essential for advancements in material science and biotechnology. However, when it comes to studying non-magnetic layers with unknown scattering length density (SLD) and morphology, traditional NR encounters significant challenges due to the phase problem.9\u201311 A low contrast between layer and substrate results in weak oscillations and leads to reduced sensitivity in the data analysis. Missing knowledge about the expected layer morphology and SLD profile can yield different models reproducing the measurements quite well, but with vastly different physical interpretation.12\u201314 In experiments where one component of the sample is submerged in water this problem is often tackled by measuring different H2O/D2O mixtures leading to contrast variation{references}. While this technique is proven it cannot always be applied as, for example, the change of contrast might require creation of a new sample that could have different SLD profile. The introduction of magnetic reference layers (MRL) and use of Polarized Neutron Reflectivity (PNR) measurements addresses the challenges in a similar way. By exploiting the distinct SLD contrasts for spin-up and spin-down neutrons, the use of an MRL then allows for the generation of two separate reflectivity curves. This dual-curve approach can lift ambiguity and help to overcome the phase problem, significantly improving the sensitivity and thus the reliability of data interpretation. It effectively circumvents the ambiguity associated"
