  "abstract": ". In this article, we establish new results on the probabilistic parking model (introduced by Durm\u00b4\u0131c, Han, Harris, Ribeiro, and Yin) with m cars and n parking spots and probability parameter p \u2208[0, 1]. For any m \u2264n and p \u2208[0, 1], we study the parking preference of the last car, denoted am, and determine the conditional distribution of am and compute its expected value. We show that both formulas depict explicit dependence on the probability parameter p. We study the case where m = cn for some 0 < c < 1 and investigate the asymptotic behavior and show that the presence of \u201cextra spots\u201d on the street significantly affects the rate at which the conditional distribution of am converges to the uniform distribution on [n]. Even for small \u03b5 = 1 \u2212c, an \u03b5-proportion of extra spots reduces the convergence rate from 1/\u221an to 1/n when p \u0338= 1/2. Additionally, we examine how the convergence rate depends on c, while keeping n and p fixed. We establish that as c approaches zero, the total variation distance between the conditional distribution of am and the uniform distribution on [n] decreases at least linearly in c. 1. Introduction A parking function of length n \u2208N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} is a tuple (a1, a2, . . . , an) \u2208[n]n, where [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}, such that its nondecreasing rearrangement (b1, b2, . . . , bn) satisfies bi \u2264i for all i \u2208n. As their name indicates, parking functions, introduced in the literature by Konheim and Weiss [30], can also be described via the following parking process: There are n cars in queue to enter a one-way street with n parking spots numbered in sequence from 1 to n. Car i has a parking preference ai \u2208[n], and we collect these preferences in a preference list \u03b1 = (a1, a2, . . . , an) \u2208[n]n. Each car enters the street and proceeds to their preferred parking spot, parking there if the spot is unoccupied. If a car finds their preferred spot occupied, then they continue down the street parking in the next available spot, if such a spot exists. Given the preference list \u03b1, if all cars are able to park within the n parking spots on the street under this classical parking protocol, then we say that the preference list \u03b1 is a parking function of length n. We let PFn denote the set of all parking functions of length n and recall that |PFn| = (n + 1)n\u22121, for a proof see [30]. There are many generalizations of parking functions, and they often arise via changes to the cars, to their preferences, or to the parking protocol involved. Such generalizations include having more spots than cars, cars having varying lengths (parking sequences and assortments), cars having an interval or subset of preferences (interval and subset parking functions), cars being able to first seek for parking backwards when finding their preference occupied (vacillating and k-Naples parking functions), or cars being bumped out of their preference by a later car in the queue (MVP parking functions) [2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 25, 35]. Parking functions are also well-connected to numerous areas of mathematics and make appearances in the study of: diagonal harmonics, ideal states in the Tower of Hanoi game, the QuickSort algorithm, Boolean intervals in the weak order on the symmetric group, facets of the permutohedron, and computing volumes of flow polytopes [3, 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 32, 36, 37].
