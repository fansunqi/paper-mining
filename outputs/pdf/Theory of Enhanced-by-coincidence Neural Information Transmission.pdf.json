  "abstract": "The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre- synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post- synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs. I. INTRODUCTION Since the first extensive simultaneous recordings of the activity of multiple neurons in the brain in vivo were performed decades ago [1\u20136], neuroscientists have consistently observed that the times at which different neurons fire are correlated. That is, the timing at which a neuron fires does not depend only on externally-measurable correlates as the sensory stimulus or the animal\u2019s decision, but also on the timing of firing of other neurons. When considering the encoding of sensory stimuli, correlations are usually measured as so called noise correlations, defined as correlations between the timing of spikes of different neurons at a fixed value of the sensory stimulus [7, 8]. Previous work has shown that noise correlations between the spike timing of different neurons is related to their anatomical connectivity [9]. However, despite being ubiquitously reported across brain activity recordings in vivo, their possible contribution to brain function remains intensively debated. Theoretical work has shown that temporally correlated inputs can profoundly affect the dynamics of spiking neuron models [10\u201322]. It has been proposed that one function of such correlations is to shape the amount of information that can be encoded in a neural population [7, 8, 22\u201325]. In particular, these studies have shown that noise correlations can have both an information-enhancing effect or an information-limiting effect on the information carried by a population of neurons [7, 25\u201329]. However, the majority of empirical studies analyzing neural recordings have reported information-limiting correlations [29], defined here as correlations that decrease the amount of information in a neuronal population [26, 30\u201332]. This has led to the widespread view that noise correlations eventually limit the ability of an organism to discriminate sensory stimuli, thus impairing perceptual discrimination and decision-making [26, 29, 31, 33]. \u2217miguel.ibanezberganza@imtlucca.it arXiv:2502.10094v1 [q-bio.NC] 14 Feb 2025"
