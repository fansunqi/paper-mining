  "abstract": "By using vectorial light shaping techniques, we successfully generated a paraxial ARPB with precise control over its features, validating theoretical predictions. Our findings demonstrate the ability to finely adjust the chirality density of the ARPB across its entire range by manipulating a single beam parameter. Although our experimental investigations are primarily focused on the transverse plane, we show that fields whose transverse components satisfy the optimal chirality condition are optimally chiral in all directions, and our results highlight the promising potential of OC structured light for applications in the sensing and manipulation of chiral particles. We show that optical chirality is more general than the concept of handedness. This work represents a significant advancement toward practical optical enantioseparation and enantiomer detection at the nanoscale. I. INTRODUCTION Part of this study was inspired by the work of Prof. Federico Capasso, to whom this special issue is dedicated. The many topics Prof. Capasso worked on include he- licity, chirality of light and the interaction with chiral matter, most notably in Refs. [1\u20133]. Some of the mate- rial of this paper was presented and discussed during the 2024 NanoPlasm Conference in Cetraro (IT) where Prof. Capasso\u2019s 75th birthday was celebrated. The study of structured light is important for various applications, including the detection of chiral nanopar- ticles [4\u20136]. Chirality is a property of objects that are not superimposable with their mirror image [7]. Impor- tantly, many biologically relevant molecules exist in chi- ral pairs, known as enantiomers [8]. The chiral nature of electromagnetic fields can be described using the optical chirality density [6, 9, 10], or the helicity density [11\u201313]. Traditionally, the \u201dhandedness\u201d of circularly polarized light has been associated with the chirality of light, but here we show that the chirality density of light is much more general than the simple concept of handedness. We employ the concept of the helicity density because it is easily associated with physical quantities of electromag- netic fields [14, 15]. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the helicity of a light field is characterized as the projec- tion of the spin angular momentum onto the direction of propagation [11]. For monochromatic beams with the implicit time dependence e\u2212i\u03c9t, where \u03c9 is the angular frequency of light, the time-average helicity density h is [16\u201318] h = 1 2\u03c9c\u2111(E \u00b7 H\u2217), (1) where E and H represent the electric and magnetic field phasors of light, respectively. The term c = 1/\u221a\u03b50\u00b50 is the speed of light in vacuum. The time- average chirality density C is proportional to the time- average helicity density h for monochromatic beams, i.e., C = \u03c92c\u22121h [17]. In Ref. [17], it was shown that the magnitude of the helicity density of a monochromatic field, at a given time- average energy density u = \u03b50|E|2/4+\u00b50|H|2/4 [19], has an upper bound, i.e., |h| \u2264u/\u03c9 always. Light fields that reach the upper bound |h| = u/\u03c9 are known as optimal chiral light (OCL). Circularly polarized light (CPL) is the most intuitive example of OCL [8], and the sign of h is related to the handedness of the CPL. The same up- per bound for the magnitude of the helicity density was stated in Ref. [20] involving fields whose Fourier spec- trum representation contains only plane waves with one circular polarization. However, the concepts of helicity density and optimal chirality hold true for any kind of monochromatic structured light, including cases where the magnetic and electric fields are polarized along a sin- gle (e.g., the beam\u2019s longitudinal) direction, and the con- cept of handedness cannot be applied. The necessary and sufficient condition for fields to be locally optimally chiral is E = \u00b1i\u03b70H, (2) where \u03b70 = p \u00b50/\u03b50 is the intrinsic impedance of free space [17]. This condition, referred to as the optimal chi- rality condition, stipulates that optimally chiral fields are those whose electric and magnetic field phasors have bal- anced magnitudes and a quarter-period phase delay be- tween them. Fields that satisfy this condition also display a remarkable electric-magnetic symmetry in their energy and spin densities [17]. Under this optimal chirality con- dition, one has h = \u00b1\u00b50|H|2/(2\u03c9) = \u00b1\u03b50|E|2/(2\u03c9). The concepts of optimal chirality and self-duality are equivalent for monochromatic beams. Self-duality refers to fields that are unchanged by the the duality transfor- mation E \u2192B and B \u2192\u2212E [20, 21]. These fields are eigenvectors of the curl [22], i.e., \u2207\u00d7 E = kE.
