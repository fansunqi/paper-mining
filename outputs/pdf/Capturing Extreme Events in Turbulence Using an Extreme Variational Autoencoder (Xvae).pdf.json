  "abstract": "Turbulent flow fields are characterized by extreme events that are statistically intermittent and carry a significant amount of energy and physical importance. To emulate these flows, we introduce the extreme variational Autoencoder (xVAE), which embeds a max-infinitely divisible process with heavy-tailed distributions into a stan- dard VAE framework, enabling accurate modeling of extreme events. xVAEs are neural network models that reduce system dimensionality by learning non-linear la- tent representations of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of xVAE in large- eddy simulation data of wildland fire plumes, where intense heat release and complex plume-atmosphere interactions generate extreme turbulence. Comparisons with the commonly used Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes show that xVAE is more robust in capturing extreme values and provides a powerful uncertainty quan- tification framework using variational Bayes. Additionally, xVAE enables analysis of the so-called copulas of fields to assess risks associated with rare events while rigor- ously accounting for uncertainty, such as simultaneous exceedances of high thresholds across multiple locations. The proposed approach provides a new direction for study- ing realistic turbulent flows, such as high-speed aerodynamics, space propulsion, and atmospheric and oceanic systems that are characterized by extreme events. Keywords: Turbulence, Spatial extremes, POD, Variational autoencoder 1 Introduction Turbulence is characterized by chaotic, unpredictable fluid motion [1, 2]. With increasing Reynolds numbers, the extreme events\u2014high intensity, rare occurrences with the formation of strong localized structures\u2014become more dominant [3, 4]. At high Reynolds numbers, extreme events such as large vortex formations, intense vorticity, intermittent bursts of energy strongly influence the behavior of turbulent flows [5, 6]. The fluctuations in ve- locity, vorticity, pressure, and other turbulent quantities in these flows are often described 1 arXiv:2502.04685v1 [physics.flu-dyn] 7 Feb 2025"
