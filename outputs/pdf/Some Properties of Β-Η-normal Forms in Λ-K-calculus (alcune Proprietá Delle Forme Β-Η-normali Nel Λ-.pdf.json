  "abstract": ". This is a plain English translation of [B\u00f6h68], originally in Italian, by Chun Tian. All footnotes (and citations only found in footnotes, of course) are added by the translator. 1. Introduction We assume the reader is familiar with the theory of \u03bb-k-calculus described in [Chu51], [Ros50], [CF58], or at least some work of the author [BG66], [B\u00f6h66]. In the following we will adopt \u201ccombinator\u201d as a synonym of formulas of the \u03bb-k-calculus without free variables. And note that combinators form a set C of entities, which can also be interpreted as functions from C to C, or from C \u00d7 C to C, or from C \u00d7 C \u00d7 C to C, etc. A subclass of combinators is constructed from the so-called normal forms, whose algebraic characteristic is arduous (di\ufb03cult to obtain). And note that the set C of combinators is generated from two normal forms distinguished among them S \u2261\u03bbx\u03bby\u03bbz (xz (yz) ) K \u2261\u03bbx\u03bby x with repeatedly \u201capplications\u201d. Now a signi\ufb01cance which can be attributed to the Corollary 1 of this work is the following: there exist no privileged normal forms (which could be considered as S and K) that, if one establish the congruence classes of combinators (with respect to applications) such that at least two non-congruent combinators exist in them, this is enough to state that each class cannot contain more than one normal form. A second signi\ufb01cance renders the Corollary 1 rather peculiar (unusual). In fact, considering normal forms as functions of a \ufb01nite number of variables, one paraphrase (explanation) of the result is: given two distinct functions it is always possible to \ufb01nd a n-tuple of arguments such that the values of the two functions for that n-tuple of arguments coincide with two pre-given arbitrary values. The Corollary 1 resolves, among others, a problem posted in [B\u00f6h66] (pp. 194): Finding an algorithm for constructing, given two distinct normal forms F and G, a combinator \u2206such that \u2206F = K, \u2206G = 0. (0 \u2261\u03bbx\u03bby y) This algorithm is implicit in the proof of Theorem 1 of the present work. It is easy to show that the combinators form a semigroup with left zeros, and an identity with respect to all composition (\u25e6) operations with the generators C\u2217, 1"
