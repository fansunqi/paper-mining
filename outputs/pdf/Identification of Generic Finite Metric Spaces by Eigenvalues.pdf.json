  "abstract": "Similarity matrices are fundamentals of the theory of magnitude. We show that \ufb01nite metric spaces can be identi\ufb01ed by the characteristic polynomials of the similartity matrices of tX (t > 0), where tX is a homothetical expansion of X by a factor t, if we restrict ourselves to a certain open dense subset of the set of \ufb01nite metric spaces. Keywords: Similarity matrix, magnitude 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation: 51F99 1 Introduction The magnitude is an invariant for metric spaces introduced by Tom Leinster [3]. We recall the de\ufb01nition after [3]. Let (X, d) be a \ufb01nite metric space, where X = {x1, . . . , xn}. Let ZX be a matrix given by (exp(\u2212d(xi, xj)))i,j, called the similarity matrix. Suppose w is a vector that satis\ufb01es ZXw = 1, where 1 = t(1, . . . , 1). It is called the weighting of X. If the weighting exists, the magnitude of X is given by t1w, denoted by |X|. Note that when ZX is invertible the magnitude |X| is given by the sum of the entries of ZX \u22121. Let tX (t > 0) be a metric space obtained by a homothetical expansion of X by a factor t, tX = (X, td). Then ZtX is invertible for all but \ufb01nitely many t > 0 ([3] Proposition 2.2.6 i). The map t 7\u2192|tX| is called the magnitude function, which is a partially de\ufb01ned function on (0, +\u221e). Let us denote it by MX(t). By putting q = e\u2212t we obtain the formal magnitude, which is a generalized formal power series allowing non-integer powers of q, denoted by mX(q). The magnitude homology MHl \u2217was introduced for graphs by Hepworth and Willerton [2] and for enriched categories by Leinster and Shulman [5]. The de\ufb01nition by the former can easily be generalized to \ufb01nite metric spaces. The formal magnitude can be considered as the Euler characteristic of the magnitude homology ([2] Theorem 2.81). Let us consider a question of to what extent the magnitude can distinguish \ufb01nite metric spaces. We showed in [7] that a generic \ufb01nite metric space can be identi\ufb01ed by the formal magnitude in the set of generic \ufb01nite metric spaces, where we say that a \ufb01nite metric space X = {x1, . . . , xn} is generic if d(xi, xj) (i < j) are rationally independent. The genericity condition was introduced to prevent data from getting mixed, resulting in the desired information being lost. On the other hand, there are known examples of spaces that are not isometric but have the same magnitude or even isomorphic magnitude homology groups (Section 3). In this paper we weaken the condition of genericity to have the notion of weakly 3-genericity which gives an open dense subset of the set of \ufb01nite metric spaces in the sense of Ro\ufb00-Yoshinaga\u2019s parametrization of \ufb01nite metric spaces ([9]), and show that in this subset \ufb01nite metric spaces can be constructed from the characteristic polynomials or equivalently the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix of tX (t > 0), in other words, they are the complete invariants for weakly 3-generic \ufb01nite metric spaces. One of the advantages \u2217Supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23K03083. 1It was proved for graphs in [2], the proof works for \ufb01nite metric spaces. 1"
