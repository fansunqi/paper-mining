  "abstract": ". We prove non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the forced \u03b1-SQG equation with Sobolev regularity W s,p in the supercritical regime s < \u03b1 + 2 p, covering the 2D Euler equation (\u03b1 = 0), the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation (\u03b1 = 1), and the intermediate cases. A key step is the construction of smooth, compactly supported vortices that exhibit non-linear instability. As a by- product, we show existence of global smooth solutions to the (unforced) \u03b1-SQG equation that are neither rotating nor traveling. Contents 1. Introduction and main results 1 2.

Introduction and main results We address the non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the generalized Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (\u03b1-SQG) equation \u2202t\u03b8 + v \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8 = f, (1.1a) v = \u2212\u2207\u22a5\u039b\u03b1\u22122\u03b8, (1.1b) \u03b8|t=0 = \u03b8\u25e6, (1.1c) posed on R2, for some given external force f and initial datum \u03b8\u25e6, where \u039b = (\u2212\u2206) 1/2. The velocity v(t, x) is recovered from the scalar \u03b8(t, x) through (1.1b), which we find convenient to refer to here as the \u03b1-Biot-Savart law (1.2) v(t, x) = C\u03b1 Z R2 (x \u2212y)\u22a5 |x \u2212y|2+\u03b1 \u03b8(t, y) dy, where C\u03b1 = 2\u03b1 2\u03c0 \u0393(1+ \u03b1 2 ) \u0393(1\u2212\u03b1 2 ) > 0. The \u03b1-SQG model was proposed by C\u00b4ordoba, Fontelos, Mancho and Rodrigo [42] as an interpo- lation between the 2D Euler equation (\u03b1 = 0) and the SQG equation (\u03b1 = 1). The Euler equation describes the motion of an ideal, incompressible fluid, capturing vorticity evolution (see e.g. [105]). The SQG equation extends this concept to geophysical fluids, modeling temperature evolution in Date: February 17, 2025. 1 arXiv:2502.10274v1 [math.AP] 14 Feb 2025"
