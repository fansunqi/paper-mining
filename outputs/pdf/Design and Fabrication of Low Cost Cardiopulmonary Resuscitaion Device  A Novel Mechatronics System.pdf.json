  "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is very common nowadays. Sudden heart attack is a condition where the heart suddenly stops beating causing a significant decrease in blood flow to the brain. The first step in medical point of view is for a patient experiencing sudden heart attack is Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).Moreover, compression rate needed for CPR process is far beyond for humans to provide manually. So, there is intense need of mechanical device which can perform resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation device is used to augment the blood flow and maintain hemodynamic cycle of human body. CPR device is proposed to meet the effective and unique blood flow mechanism, feedback system. In term of effective and unique blood flow mechanism design and fabrication of low cost cardiopulmonary resuscitation device based on principle of CPR and two concepts. It is combined Sterno-Thoracic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The \"cardiac pump\" generates blood flow by squeezing blood out of the heart as the sternum is depressed. The \"thoracic pump\" increases intrathoracic pressure due to elastic recoil of ribs. In order to meet the American Heart Association standard guidelines a feedback system has established through closed loop control system, and integration of processing controllers. Specifically, a small HMI (Human machine interface) device has been established to control the whole mechanism which would be used for child, Adults and Senior citizens as a manual intelligence system. Henceforth, feedback system act as backbone for this device. Keywords: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, Closed loop Control System, Human Machine Interface, Cardiac pump, Thoracic pump. I. INTRODUCTION In recent surveys of American Heart Association showed that more than 93% died each year due to cardiac arrest and hardly 2.3% out of them get the resuscitation [1]. Concerning this American Heart Association (AHA) proposed the standard CPR guidelines in 2010. These guidelines told that compression rate needed for the patient should be 100 compression/min and depth of compression must be [1, 1.5inches] applied at the rate of 30:2. It means after 30 compression, resuscitator need to provide two ventilation to the cardiac arrest victim. Afterward, based on that guidelines various device have been proposed for resuscitation procedure. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation is an emergency procedure that combines the chest compression to provide the blood circulation of human body. Based on that principal different research and developments have been proposed and still on work. While process of CPR include Coronary perfusion pressure acts as a reliable measure of predict the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Furthermore, CPP is the difference between aortic the diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure of heart a CPP of 15 mmHg is needed. The rise up in diastolic blood pressure reflects an increase in coronary flow while the highness in mean blood pressure reflects a positive impact on neural function. Leroy in 1829, proposed the method of ventilation using manual chest compressions with movements of hands [2]. Although manual heart compression mechanism was stablished for resuscitation but soon they realized that human could not be able to provide 100compression/min at standard 30:1 ratio [3]. It implied, because human got exhausted and required depth of compression was also main enigma. Fig 1: Chest compression by hand"
