  "abstract": "This phenomenon, known as information scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can hinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when the system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling transition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a novel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which occurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a probe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We calculate the increase in the second R\u00b4enyi entropy induced by an external impulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe coupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates at a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is limited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical prediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using generalized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the intriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in open quantum systems. Introduction.\u2013 In closed quantum systems, the process of quantum thermalization involves the complete scrambling of local initial conditions throughout the system after a suf- ficiently long unitary evolution [1, 2]. This phenomenon, known as information scrambling [3\u20136], is quantified by out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) that measures the growth of operator size [7\u201325]. It has been extensively stud- ied in various contexts [26, 27], revealing broad implications for quantum many-body dynamics. For instance, the OTOC- RE theorem provides an exact relation between the decay of OTOCs and the increase in the second R\u00b4enyi entropy follow- ing a quantum quench [28\u201333], which has been used to ex- perimentally measure entropy dynamics [34]. Recent devel- opments further extend this correspondence to the Von Neu- mann entropy using perturbative calculations, which involves introducing branched OTOCs for arbitrary replicas [35, 36]. On the other hand, there is growing interest in understand- ing the non-equilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems. One intriguing aspect is the competition between dissipation and scrambling in the evolution of quantum information [37\u2013 51]. In particular, it has been established that a transition from a scrambling phase, where the operator size exhibits exponential growth, to a dissipative phase, where the oper- ator size decays exponentially, can be induced by tuning the system-environment coupling in both fermionic and qubit sys- tems [42, 43, 50]. Subsequent investigations show that this transition can also be interpreted as a change in the quantum information processing capability, as revealed by the fidelity of many-body quantum teleportation protocol [51]. Never- theless, despite the close relationship between information scrambling and entropy growth, how this scrambling transi- tion gives rise to novel phenomena in entropy dynamics re- mains an open question. One main challenge is that, despite the transition in operator size, the system always thermalizes V=0 small V large V t \u03b4S(2) J V Probe \uf8ff Bath \" eP1IwcW9Xc72Ii0Lx5Xm6JVI0ok=\">ACzXicjVHLTs JAFD3UF+ILdemEU1ckWJ8LUncuBMTC0QgpC0DTugrn akJQd36A271t4x/oH/hnbEkKjE6Tdsz595zZu69buxzI S3rNWfMzM7NL+QXC0vLK6trxfWNuojSxGO2F/lR0nQd wXweMlty6bNmnDAncH3WcIenKt64YngUXgpRzHrBM4 g5H3uOZKoK7vbZrHgfhR2iyWrbOlToNKBkrIVi0qvqC NHiJ4SBGAIYQk7MOBoKeFCizExHUwJi4hxHWc4Q4F0q aUxSjDIXZI3wHtWhkb0l5Cq326BSf3oSUJnZJE1FeQl idZup4qp0V+5v3WHuqu43o72ZeAbES18T+pZtk/lena pHo40TXwKmWDOqOi9zSXVX1M3NL1VJcoiJU7hH8YSwp 5WTPptaI3TtqreOjr/pTMWqvZflpnhXt6QBV36OcxrU 98uVo/LhxUGpupONOo8tbGOP5nmMKs5Qg03eIR7xhGf j3EiNW+P+M9XIZpNfFvGwdGCZNV</latexit>U\u270f (\uf8ff\u2327J, V ) FIG. 1.

The results reveal distinct features as V/J is tuned across the entanglement transition. Notably, only in the scrambling phase (for small V), does the entropy continuously increase, eventually saturating to a finite value, a phenomenon we refer to as entropy accumulation. for any non-zero system-bath coupling, resulting in the same saturation entropy for the system [43]. In this letter, we overcome this difficulty by introducing an alternative setup. Specifically, we consider a probe weakly coupled to the open system, which is embedded within a bath, as depicted in Fig. 1.
