We compute the local intersection cohomology of the irreducible components of varieties of complexes, by using Lusztig\u2019s geometric approach to quantum groups and explicit constructions of elements of Lusztig\u2019s canonical bases. 1. Introduction The Buchsbaum-Eisenbud varieties of complexes [1], parametrizing degree one di\ufb00erentials on \ufb01nite-dimensional graded vector spaces, form an interesting and well-studied class of singular a\ufb03ne varieties. Their irreducible components are proven to be normal, Cohen-Macaulay, with rational singularities [5, 2, 3, 7] and Frobenius-split [10], their de\ufb01ning equations, singular loci and their divisor class group are known [3, 6, 13], and open embeddings into Schubert varieties are con- structed [11]. In the present work, we complement this with quantitative topological information on the irreducible components, by describing in Theorem 5.1 the Poincar\u00b4e poly- nomials of their local intersection cohomology (that is, the stalks of cohomology sheaves of their intersection cohomology complexes). To achieve this, we use the geometric realization of canonical bases of quantized enveloping algebras [8, 9], which identi\ufb01es the relevant Poincar\u00b4e polynomials with the base change coe\ufb03cients between canonical and PBW type bases. The elements of the former corresponding to the irreducible components of varieties of complexes can be constructed using ideas of [12]. We note that a similar strategy, obtaining new geometric information from calcula- tions in quantized enveloping algebras, was employed in earlier work [4] in relation to families of degenerate \ufb02ag varieties. We also note that the irreducible compo- nents of varieties of complexes do not admit small resolutions in general, making it more surprising that all local intersection cohomology can be computed explicitly. We review the de\ufb01nition of the variety of complexes in Section 2 and give a parametrization of their irreducible components. In Section 3, we review the geo- metric realization of canonical bases of quantized enveloping algebras via Hall al- gebras. The relevant elements of the canonical basis are constructed in Section 4, and the geometric consequences are worked out in Section 5.
