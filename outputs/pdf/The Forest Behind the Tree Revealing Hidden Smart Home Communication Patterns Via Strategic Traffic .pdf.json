  "abstract": "Previous research has shown these devices follow predictable network communication patterns, allowing researchers to model their normal network behavior and detect potential security breaches. However, existing approaches only observe traffic passively rather than actively trying to disturb it. We present a framework that generates comprehensive network signatures for Smart Home devices by systematically blocking previously observed traffic patterns to reveal new, hidden patterns that other methods miss. These signatures are structured as behavior trees, where each child node represents network flows that occur when the parent node\u2019s traffic is blocked. We applied this framework on ten real-world devices under 26 usage scenarios, discovering 138 unique flows, of which 27 (20%) are information gained through our multi-level tree approach, compared to state-of-the-art single-level traffic analysis.

A popular use case of this paradigm is the Smart Home, composed of household objects, ranging from small power outlets to large appliances. The popularity of Smart Home devices has increased sharply in the past years, with a market size estimated at 101.07 billion USD in 2024 [15]. Smart Home devices pose a critical security and safety risk, as they can act directly on the user\u2019s personal space, digitally and physically. Moreover, as such devices are basically always connected to the internet, they form a large attack surface. Smart Home devices are therefore interesting targets for cyber attacks. In fact, a recent report by NETGEAR [9] concluded that, in average, a Authors\u2019 Contact Information: Fran\u00e7ois De Keersmaeker, francois.dekeersmaeker@uclouvain.be, UCLouvain, Louvain- la-Neuve, Belgium; R\u00e9mi Van Boxem, remi.van-boxem@student.junia.com, JUNIA, Lille, France; Cristel Pelsser, cristel. pelsser@uclouvain.be, UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Ramin Sadre, ramin.sadre@uclouvain.be, UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.
