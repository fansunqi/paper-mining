  "abstract": ". In this article, we study regularity properties for degenerate parabolic double-phase equations. We establish continuity estimates for bounded weak solutions in terms of elliptic Riesz potentials on the right-hand side of the equation. 1. Introduction In this work, we are concerned with the regularity problem of bounded weak solutions to inho- mogeneous parabolic double-phase equations of the type \u2202tu \u2212div[|Du|p\u22122Du + a(x, t)|Du|q\u22122Du] = f (1.1) in a space-time domain \u2126T = \u2126\u00d7 (0, T), where \u2126\u2282Rn is a bounded open set and T > 0. Here, the coe\ufb03cient function a(x, t) is nonnegative and locally H\u00f6lder continuous in \u2126T. Double-phase problem is a classical topic in partial di\ufb00erential equations, and it is motivated by physical prob- lems. The elliptic double-phase equations play a crucial role in the study of nonlinear elasticity and the homogenization of strongly anisotropic materials (see, for example [30, 31]). Moreover, reg- ularity theory such as Harnack\u2019s inequality, H\u00f6lder continuity, higher integrability and Calder\u00f3n- Zygmund type estimates for elliptic double-phase problems have been studied in [3, 11\u201313, 15]. In recent years, there has been tremendous interest in developing regularity theory for parabolic double-phase equations. The existence of weak solutions to the parabolic double-phase equa- tions has been proved by Chlebicka, Gwiazda, and Zatorska-Goldstein [10]. The gradient higher integrability results have been established by Kim, Kinnunen, Moring and S\u00e4rki\u00f6 [18, 21]; see also [26] for the degenerate/singular parabolic multi-phase problems. Furthermore, the Calder\u00f3n- Zygmund type estimate has been studied in [17]. Recently, Kim, Moring and S\u00e4rki\u00f6 [20] and independently Buryachenko and Skrypnik [9] proved the H\u00f6lder continuity of weak solutions to parabolic double-phase equations. In [9], the authors also established the Harnack\u2019s inequality. On the other hand, it is natural to try to relate the potential theory to the double-phase problems. However, limited work has been done in this \ufb01eld. The \ufb01rst regularity result for nonlinear elliptic equations with measure data and general growth was established by Baroni [2]. In [8], the au- thors established local boundedness and Harnack\u2019s inequality for double-phase elliptic equations in terms of the Wol\ufb00potentials. Subsequently, Buryachenko [7] proved the local boundedness of weak solutions to parabolic double-phase equations in terms of the time-dependent parabolic potentials. Motivated by this work, we are interested in the continuity estimate for the degener- ate parabolic double-phase equations of the type (1.1) in terms of elliptic Riesz potentials of the function f. Our main result states that any weak solution to degenerate parabolic double-phase equations is continuous provided that f belongs to a Kato-type class. Our proof is in the spirit of [6\u20139, 20, 23, 25], which uses a phase analysis, estimates in the intrinsic geometries, De Giorgi method and Kilpel\u00e4inen-Mal\u00fd technique. More precisely, our approach could be incorporated in the framework of De Giorgi\u2019s method developed in [14, 20, 29]. In the context of degenerate parabolic double-phase problems, we have found the intrinsic cylinder in the form QR,\u0398\u03c9(R)(x0, t0) = BR(x0) \u00d7 (t0 \u2212\u0398\u03c9(R), t0] , where \u0398\u03c9(R) = \u03c92 \u0012\u0012\u03c9 R \u0013p + a(x0, t0) \u0012\u03c9 R \u0013q\u0013\u22121 to be expedient, see [20]. It is essential in the proof of our main result. The strategy of the proofs of De Giorgi-type lemmas makes use of the Kilpel\u00e4inen-Mal\u00fd technique.
