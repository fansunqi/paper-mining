In this work, we propose and investigate a novel approach to surface passivation to mitigate these challenges in photonic nanostructures with III-As(P) quantum wells defined by a dry etching process. The nanostructures are annealed under the phosphine (PH3) ambient inside a metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy chamber to eliminate surface and subsurface defects induced during the dry etching and subsequent oxidation of the etched sidewalls. Moreover, encapsulation of the active material with a wider bandgap material allows for maintaining the band structure of the device, mitigating band bending effects. Our findings reveal an almost order of magnitude reduction in the surface recombination velocity from 2 \u00d7 103 cm/s for the PH3 annealing compared to 1.5 \u00d7 104 cm/s for the non-passivated structures and 5\u00d7103 cm/s for the standard method based on (NH4)2S wet treatment followed by Al2O3 encapsulation. A further reduction to 5\u00d7102 cm/s is achieved for the InP-regrown samples. Additionally, we develop a model accounting for the impact of surface charges in the analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence curves and demonstrate that the proposed passivation method effectively reduces the surface charge density on the sidewalls of the studied quantum well-based photonic nanostructures. Keywords: surface passivation, surface recombination, III-V quantum wells, MOVPE growth, ICP etching, time-resolved photoluminescence; INTRODUCTION The advancement of nanophotonics and quantum photon- ics has been a key driving force behind the development of nanofabrication techniques, facilitating the continued miniatur- ization of photonic devices, ultimately enabling the coherent control of light even at sub-wavelength scales1. Consequently, this reduction in the size of photonic components significantly increases the surface-to-volume ratio, thus increasing the im- pact of the surface on the device performance. Generally, semiconductor surfaces can have a detrimental effect on the performance of photonic devices, caused by non-radiative car- rier recombination through surface states in the bandgap of the optically active region2,3 or charge noise4. In III-V materials that contain either As or P as the group V element \u2013 referred to as III-As(P) \u2013 and emit in the near-infrared range, surface defects are typically caused by uncontrolled surface oxidation. This oxidation leads to the formation of gap states associated with As dangling bonds and As-As dimers5. In addition to oxidation, ion-induced damage during dry etching of III-V materials, a process broadly used for device fabrication, could be a source of various types of surface and crystal point defects in volume6,7. Subsequently, considerable efforts from research groups worldwide have focused on surface state passivation to miti- *)Electronic mail: esem@fotonik.dtu.dk gate non-radiative losses and preserve the optical and quantum efficiency of miniaturized devices. Several methods to reduce the detrimental effect of surface-related defects in III-V nanos- tructures have been reported so far. They include, first of all, native oxide removal steps. The most widely used approach is the wet-chemical treatment of surfaces with ammonium or sodium sulfides8,9. Alternatively to sulfur-based chemicals, surface nitridation was also used to reduce non-radiative re- combination in GaAs nanostructures10,11. These wet-chemical approaches are usually combined with atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of amorphous layers to prevent surface re-oxidation12,13. Other works also report the possibility of oxide removal from III-As surfaces inside the ALD chamber (termed \"self-cleaning\") before oxide or nitride deposition14,15. The above methods aim to reduce the oxidation-related defects but do not treat the surface and sub-surface crystal defects caused by bombardment with ions during the dry etch. Therefore, an additional etch in diluted H2SO4:H2O2:H2O solution is used between the ion etching and surface passivation13,16. This approach implies wet etch removal of an outer layer up to tens of nanometers thickness of III-V materials, which could be incompatible with shape imperfection-sensitive structures such as photonic crystals, mi- croresonators, and cavities with extreme dielectric confine- ment17. Alternatively, structural defects can be at least partially healed during high-temperature annealing. However, at high temperatures, the desorption of Vth group atoms occurs, which can be compensated for by supplying the corresponding adatom arXiv:2502.08616v1 [physics.optics] 12 Feb 2025"
