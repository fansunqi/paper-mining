  "title": "The Life Cycle of Giant Molecular Clouds in Simulated Milky Way-mass Galaxies.pdf",
  "abstract": "Context. Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are the primary sites of star formation in galaxies. Their evolution, driven by the inter- play of gravitational collapse, stellar feedback, and galactic dynamics, is key to understanding local star formation on GMC scales. However, tracking the full life cycle of GMCs across diverse galactic environments remains challenging and requires high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations and robust post-processing analysis. Aims. We aim to trace the complete life cycle of individual GMCs in high-resolution Milky Way\u2013mass galaxy simulations to deter- mine how different stellar feedback mechanisms and galactic-scale processes govern cloud lifetimes, mass evolution, and local star formation efficiency (SFE). Methods. We identify GMCs in simulated galaxies and track their evolution using cloud evolution trees. Via cloud evolution trees, we quantify the lifetimes and SFE of GMCs. We further apply our diagnostics on a suite of simulations with varying star formation and stellar feedback subgrid models and explore their impact together with galactic environments to the GMC life cycles. Results. Our analysis reveals that GMCs undergo dynamic evolution, characterized by continuous gas accretion, gravitational col- lapse, and star formation, followed by disruption due to stellar feedback. The accretion process sustains the gas content throughout most of the GMC life cycles, resulting in a positive correlation between GMC lifetimes and their maximum masses. The GMC life- times range from a few to several tens of Myr, with two distinct dynamical modes: (1) GMCs near the galactic center experience strong tidal disturbances, prolonging their lifetimes when they remain marginally unbound; (2) those in the outer regions are less affected by tides, remain gravitationally bound, and evolve more rapidly. In all model variations, we observe that GMC-scale SFE correlates with the baryonic surface density of GMCs, consistent with previous studies of isolated GMCs. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of galactic shear in regulating GMC-scale star formation and refine the correlation between local SFE and surface density by including its effects. These findings demonstrate how stellar feedback and galactic-scale dynamics jointly shape GMC-scale star formation in realistic galactic environments.

Introduction Star formation is known to be inefficient on galactic scale, with a global molecular gas depletion time around 2 \u221210 Gyr, roughly one order of magnitude longer than the dynamical timescale of galactic disks and two orders of magnitude longer than the lo- cal free-fall time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) (Kennicutt 1998; Bigiel et al. 2011; Kennicutt & Evans 2012; Sun et al. 2023). The long gas depletion timescale as well as low global star formation efficiency (SFE) in galaxies can be explained ei- ther by a uniformly low star formation rate across all individual GMCs (Krumholz & McKee 2005; Federrath & Klessen 2012; Pokhrel et al. 2021) or by a highly variable SFE during the evo- lution of GMCs with diverse GMC properties and galactic envi- ronments (Lee et al. 2016; Kruijssen et al. 2018; Chevance et al. 2023). To distinguish between the above two scenarios, it is crit- ical to investigate the detailed life cycles of GMCs and the local star formation process observationally and theoretically. In observations of GMCs in the Local Group, the star for- mation efficiency per free-fall time\u2014measured through tracers such as H\u03b1 and FUV\u2014exhibits significant scatter, often exceed- ing 0.3 dex (Murray 2011; Lee et al. 2016; Vutisalchavakul et al. 2016; Ochsendorf et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2023). This observed variability presents a challenge to the theory of a universally low, constant SFE. Moreover, the uniformly low SFE scenario implies long-lived GMCs with a lifetime of at least \u223c100 Myr. However, numerous observational studies estimate that the GMC lifetimes are significantly shorter, typically in the range of \u223c5 Myr to \u223c50 Myr (Murray 2011; Miura et al. 2012; Kruijssen & Longmore 2014; Kruijssen et al. 2018, 2019; Chevance et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2022; Ward et al. 2022). These lifetimes align with the typical cloud-scale free-fall time and turbulence cross- ing time, indicating that GMCs are unlikely to sustain low SFE Article number, page 1 of 12 arXiv:2502.12256v1 [astro-ph.GA] 17 Feb 2025"
