  "abstract": "To stimulate the adoption of relevant technologies such as rooftop PV and heat pumps, governments and utilities have designed incentives that encourage adoption of decarbonization technologies. However, studies have shown that many of these incentives and/or subsidies are inefficient since a substantial fraction of spending does not actually promote adoption. Further, these incentives and/or subsidies are not equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach that adopts a holistic, emissions-based and city-scale perspective on decarbonization. We propose an optimization model that dynamically allocates a total incentive budget to households to directly maximize the resultant carbon emissions reduction \u2013 this is in contrast to prior work, which focuses on metrics such as the number of new installations. We leverage techniques for the multi-armed bandits problem to estimate human factors, such as a household\u2019s willingness to adopt new technologies given a certain incentive. We apply our proposed dynamic incentive framework to a city in the Northeast U.S., using real household energy data, grid carbon intensity data, and future price scenarios. We show that our learning-based technique significantly outperforms an example of status quo incentives offered by a state and utility, achieving up to 32.23% higher carbon reductions. Additionally, our incentive allocation approach is able to achieve significant carbon reduction even in a broad set of environments, with varying values for carbon intensity of the grid and gas and electric prices. Finally, we show that our framework can accommodate equity-aware constraints to preserve an equitable allocation of incentives across socioeconomic groups while achieving 78.84% of the carbon reductions of the optimal solution on average. 1 INTRODUCTION Many countries, regions, and cities in the world have set ambitious goals for decarbonization, e.g., net zero CO2 emissions by 2035 or 2050 [100]. Any realistic climate scenarios to net zero by 2050 require deep reductions in both the energy usage and carbon emissions of buildings, industry, and transportation as well as improvements in energy efficiency throughout the economy [73]. Residential buildings accounted for 22% of global energy consumption in 2020 [43], where a significant portion is due to carbon-intensive energy uses such as the direct combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas for residential heating [49]. Furthermore, many fuel-based appliances and heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems are less energy efficient than their electric counterparts [70]. Therefore, any reductions in the carbon emissions from the residential sector can contribute significantly to the reduction of global emissions. One of the most promising approaches to deeply decarbonize the residential sector is to electrify energy demand, i.e., eliminate appliances and HVAC systems that directly emit carbon, and simultaneously deploy distributed energy resources (DER) such as rooftop solar and battery storage to ensure a steady supply of carbon-free electricity [93]. Improvements in energy efficiency for many household appliances, such as heat pumps, and decreases in costs have made these technologies a safe and affordable option for a wide range of geographical regions and climate zones [24].
