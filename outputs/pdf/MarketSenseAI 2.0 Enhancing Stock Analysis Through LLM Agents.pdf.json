  "title": "MarketSenseAI 2.0 Enhancing Stock Analysis Through LLM Agents.pdf",
  "abstract": "MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which lever- ages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support deci- sion making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expan- sion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earn- ings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S&P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while main- taining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S&P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework\u2019s scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in apply- ing LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.
