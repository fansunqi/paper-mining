  "title": "LLM-Driven Augmented Reality Puppeteer Controller-Free Voice-Commanded Robot Teleoperation.pdf",
  "abstract": ". The integration of robotics and augmented reality (AR) presents transformative opportunities for advancing human-robot interaction (HRI) by improving usability, intuitiveness, and accessibility. This work intro- duces a controller-free, LLM-driven voice-commanded AR puppeteering system, enabling users to teleoperate a robot by manipulating its vir- tual counterpart in real-time.
