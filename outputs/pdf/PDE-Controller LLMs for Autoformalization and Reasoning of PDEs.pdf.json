  "abstract": "While recent AI-for-math has made strides in pure mathematics, areas of applied mathemat- ics, particularly PDEs, remain underexplored de- spite their significant real-world applications. We present PDE-Controller, a framework that en- ables large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach enables LLMs to trans- form informal natural language instructions into formal specifications, and then execute reason- ing and planning steps to improve the utility of PDE control. We build a holistic solution com- prising datasets (both human-written cases and 2 million synthetic samples), math-reasoning mod- els, and novel evaluation metrics, all of which require significant effort. Our PDE-Controller sig- nificantly outperforms prompting the latest open- source and GPT models in reasoning, autofor- malization, and program synthesis, achieving up to a 62% improvement in utility gain for PDE control. By bridging the gap between language generation and PDE systems, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scien- tific and engineering challenges. We will release all data, model checkpoints, and code at https: //pde-controller.github.io/. 1. Introduction Recent advancements have significantly enhanced capa- bilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) (McKinzie et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2023). LLMs possess pretrained common knowledge and solves daily life tasks that require commonsense reasoning without domain-specific expertise. However, this reliance on generalized knowledge exposes significant weaknesses in complex domains. LLMs strug- gle with precise mathematical reasoning (Mirzadeh et al., *Equal contribution 1School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University 2Department of Computer Science, Princeton University 3Department of Mathematics, Simon Fraser University 4Department of Physics, Simon Fraser University.

Addressing these limitations will require enhancing LLMs with external tools or domain-specific reasoning. Recent advancements in AI-for-math (Lu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024) have significantly enhanced LLMs in logical, formal, and quantitative reasoning, particularly for pure mathematics (geometry, probability, calculus, algebra, num- ber theory, and combinatorics). These efforts address chal- lenges from grade school math (Cobbe et al., 2021) to the In- ternational Mathematical Olympiad (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Trinh et al., 2024). However, the advancement of LLMs for applied mathematics, such as partial differential equations (PDEs), remains underexplored. Unlike pure mathematics for abstract theory, applied mathematics directly addresses practical challenges, bridging theory and real-world needs. For example, PDEs are fundamental in modeling physical dynamics (aerospace engineering, quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics), providing a framework to understand and con- trol systems. Integrating LLMs into applied mathematics, particularly for PDE control, holds substantial potential for advancing scientific and engineering applications. 1 arXiv:2502.00963v1 [cs.LG] 3 Feb 2025"
