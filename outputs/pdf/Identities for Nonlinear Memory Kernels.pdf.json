  "title": "Identities for Nonlinear Memory Kernels.pdf",
  "abstract": "Here we derive identities for the nonlinear memory kernels arising in such nonlinear expansion, including the possibility of a nonlinear coupling between perturbation and system. These identities rely on local detailed balance, and they include the fluctuation dissipation theorem as the lowest order identity. We test them in simulations for driven over- and underdamped Brownian particles. These identities for memory kernels can be recast in a series relation for the non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving and the observable described by the Volterra series. I. INTRODUCTION When a system is driven away from equilibrium by a perturbation protocol, its non-equilibrium evolution is generally expected to be a convolution of the pro- tocol with linear or nonlinear memory kernels [1\u20135]. Such memory kernels have been found via projection operator techniques [6\u20139], in which a set of degrees of freedom are projected out, or in mode-coupling theory (MCT) [10, 11]. Notably, in these formulations for sys- tems close to equilibrium, the memory kernels formally appear in response to thermal fluctuations rather than external perturbations [1]. Such formulations then give rise to non-Markovian stochastic descriptions, including non-Markovian Langevin equations, exemplified for the sub-diffusive plateau in mean squared displacements [12] observed experimentally [13\u201316]. For linear systems, such as for a probe particle in a bath of harmonic oscillators, the famous Caldeira-Leggett model [8, 17], explicit forms for the appearing kernels are found. Driving non-linear systems more strongly will bring them far away from equilibrium causing nonlinear re- sponse and nonlinear fluctuations with less well known properties. Examples of behaviors that have been found for strongly driven systems are particle oscillations [18, 19], shear-thinning for macro- or micro-shear [20\u201322] or nonlinear behavior of Brownian particles immersed in micellar fluids [23\u201326]. Also superdiffusive behav- ior [22, 27, 28] can occur under strong driving. Non- trivial fluctuations of system far away from equilibrium have been rationalized in terms of temperatures that are different from ambient temperature, so called effective temperatures [29\u201332]. It is challenging to describe systems driven far away from equilibrium theoretically. One successful route ex- tends the above mentioned projection operator tech- niques to stronger driving, [4, 21, 33\u201342], including the integration through transient technique [4]. Also approaches in field theory [19, 30] have been extended \u2217j.caspers@theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de \u2020 matthias.kruger@uni-goettingen.de to systems far away from equilibrium. Dynamical den- sity functional theory [41, 43\u201346], including power func- tional theory, provides powerful tools. Lattice mod- els [28, 47, 48] allow for analytical solutions in certain cases. Nonlinear response theory [49\u201351] within path in- tegral formalism [52\u201355] forms another promising route. Using such nonlinear response theory, Volterra series ex- pansions for the mean response as well as for fluctuations have been formulated recently [56]. In this manuscript, we present a general Volterra se- ries expansion for a system driven by a time dependent protocol, based on the methods of Refs. [50, 51, 56]. The Volterra series contains nonlinear memory kernels for the cumulants involving the observable conjugate to the driv- ing protocol, and the observable the series is designed for. In contrast to previous work [56], we lift the re- striction to overdamped Brownian particles, so that in this manuscript the perturbation in general enters non- linearly in entropy production. The main new result in this manuscript are however identities for the nonlinear memory kernels occurring in this series. These are found to rely on local detailed balance, and the lowest order identity is the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We show how they yield a series identity for non-equilibrium cu- mulants. The latter becomes the familiar expansion of the Boltzmann weight for a step like protocol. These identities are tested in simulations of driven over or un- derdamped Brownian particles with nonlinear interac- tions [26, 57]. II. SYSTEM AND SUMMARY OF IDENTITIES Consider a system of N stochastic degrees of free- dom y(i) (i = 1, . . . , N), abbreviated y, in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, coupled to a deter- ministic control parameter xs with time index s, via the energy function U(ys, xs). The system is prepared in equilibrium at time s = t0 with x taking the value xt0, i.e., for s \u2264t0, the distribution of y is the Boltz- mann distribution for U(y, xt0). xs follows the protocol X = (xs, t0 \u2264s \u2264t), driving the system away from equi- librium for s > t0. The derivative of U with respect to xs defines the observable conjugate to the protocol, arXiv:2502.10179v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 14 Feb 2025"
