  "abstract": "We fold the 2D plane hosting the topological order into the foundamental domain of the group group, which is a sector with an angle 2\u03c0/n for the cyclic point group Cn and a sector with an angle \u03c0/n for the dihedral point group D2n, and the point-group symmetries becomes onsite unitary symmetries on the sector. The enrichment of the point-group symmetries is then fully encoded at the boundary of the sector and the apex of the section, which forms a junction between the two boundaries. The mirror-symmetry enrichment encoded on the boundaries is analyzed by the classification theory of symmetric gapped boundaries, and the point- group-symmetry enrichment encoded on the junction is analyzed by a framework for classifying symmetric gapped junctions between boundaries which we develop in this work. We show that at the junction, there are two potential obstructions, which we refer to as an H1 obstruction and an H2 obstruction, respectively. When the obstruction vanishes, the junction, and therefore the point- group-symmetry-enriched topological orders, are classified by an H0 cohomology class and an H1 cohomology class, which can be understood as an additional Abelian anyon and a symmetry charge attached to the rotation center, respectively. These results are consistent with the classification of onsite-symmetry-enriched topological orders, where the H1 and H2 obstructions and the junction corresponds to the H3 and H4 obstructions for onsite symmetries, respectively. I. INTRODUCTION The interplay between symmetry and topol- ogy has become an important theme in mod- ern condensed-matter physics. In particular, states with intrinsic topological orders host frac- tional quasiparticle excitations known as the anyons [1\u20133]. Intrinsic topological orders can be further enriched by global symmetries, form- ing symmetry-enriched topological (SET) or- ders [4\u20137]. Such symmetry enrichment can be used as signatures for detecting fraction- alization [8\u201312] and nontrivial topological ex- citation in numerical simulations and experi- ments [13, 14], and symmetry defects in SET phases may host degrees of freedom that can be used to store and manipulate quantum infor- mation [15]. These motivates us to study SET orders, especially the classification of SET or- ders for a given underlying intrinsic topological \u2217qiyang@fudan.edu.cn order and a global symmetry group. For an onsite symmetry group G, the clas- sification of SET orders is described by the G-crossed braided tensor category theory [16]. However, when G contains crystalline symme- tries, the problem of classifying crystalline-SET orders is still not fully solved. The crystalline equivalence principle proposed by Thorngren and Else [17] can be used to compute the classi- fication, using an one-to-one correspondence be- tween crystalline-SETs and onsite-SETs. How- ever, this equivalence principle does not di- rectly offer a transparent understanding of the crystalline-SET states. The idea of real-space construction has been a fruitful approach to study topological phases protected or enriched by crystalline symmetries [18, 19]. Dimensional reduction [20\u201322], or more generally a real- space recipe, can be used to study crystalline- symmetry-protected topological states, or the topological crystalline states, by breaking them down to lower-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states decorated on lower- dimensional cells in the crystal, such as mirror arXiv:2502.11106v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 16 Feb 2025"
