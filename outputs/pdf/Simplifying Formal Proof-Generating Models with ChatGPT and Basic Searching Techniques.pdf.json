  "title": "Simplifying Formal Proof-Generating Models with ChatGPT and Basic Searching Techniques.pdf",
  "abstract": ". The challenge of formal proof generation has a rich history, but with modern techniques, we may finally be at the stage of making actual progress in real-life mathematical problems. This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT and basic searching techniques to simplify generating formal proofs, with a particular focus on the miniF2F dataset. We demonstrate how combining a large language model like ChatGPT with a formal language such as Lean, which has the added advantage of being verifiable, enhances the efficiency and accessibility of formal proof generation. Despite its simplicity, our best-performing Lean-based model surpasses all known benchmarks with a 31.15% pass rate. We ex- tend our experiments to include other datasets and employ alternative language models, showcasing our models\u2019 comparable performance in di- verse settings and allowing for a more nuanced analysis of our results. Our findings offer insights into AI-assisted formal proof generation, sug- gesting a promising direction for future research in formal mathematical proof. Keywords: Mathematical reasoning, Formal proof generation, Proof search, Large language model 1 Introduction Writing mathematical proofs in formal language has been a research topic for many years. Notably, we recall McCarthy\u2019s symbolic computation on machines [18], Hoare\u2019s axiomatic approach to computer programming [13], and DeMillo, Lipton, and Perlis\u2019s skepticism towards formal proofs of theorems [8]. Due to the surprising performance of AI algorithms witnessed over the last decade, such as transformers in natural language processing, we believe it is an opportune time to revisit the formal proof challenge with the modern techniques available. As evidenced by our literature review below, we are not alone in this pursuit. arXiv:2502.03321v2 [cs.LO] 7 Feb 2025"
