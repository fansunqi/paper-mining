  "title": "Information Types in Product Reviews.pdf",
  "abstract": "Information in text is communicated in a way that supports a goal for its reader. Product reviews, for example, contain opinions, tips, product descriptions, and many other types of information that provide both direct insights, as well as unexpected signals for downstream applications. We devise a typology of 24 com- municative goals in sentences from the product review domain, and employ a zero-shot multi- label classifier that facilitates large-scale analy- ses of review data. In our experiments, we find that the combination of classes in the typology forecasts helpfulness and sentiment of reviews, while supplying explanations for these deci- sions. In addition, our typology enables analy- sis of review intent, effectiveness and rhetorical structure. Characterizing the types of informa- tion in reviews unlocks many opportunities for more effective consumption of this genre.1 1 Introduction A body of text is written with a purpose of convey- ing a message to its reader. Information within the text is expressed in various formats and styles in order to fulfill this goal (Levy, 1979). By identify- ing these methods of communication, a reader can focus on information of interest, or, conversely, ob- tain a clearer picture of the holistic intent of the full text. In automatic applications, this is commonly accomplished by means of text classification that categorizes types of text spans. Types of text differ across domains and com- municative objectives. For example, media cov- erage or debate statements attempt to convince of an ideological stance by using different frame ty- pologies like \u2018morality\u2019 or \u2018legality\u2019 (Naderi and Hirst, 2017; Ali and Hassan, 2022). Scientific ar- ticles contain snippets of texts purposed for ex- plaining the discussed matter, like \u2018background\u2019 or 1Code and resources: https://github.com/ OriShapira/InfoTypes Figure 1: A sentence from a review, and the dominant information types communicated in it. \u2018results\u2019 (Dernoncourt and Lee, 2017; Cohan et al., 2019). Product reviews often differ in sentiment to express an opinion regarding an aspect of the product (Serrano-Guerrero et al., 2015; Yadav and Vishwakarma, 2020). Additionally, the length of a text influences its allowance for verbosity and detail (Louis and Nenkova, 2014), and its rhetori- cal structure allows for a coherent arrangement of ideas within the text (Mann and Thompson, 1988). These characteristics, and others, provide means for classifying and analyzing text, at the levels of words, sentences, or documents. In the e-commerce domain, product reviews as- sist a potential customer in learning about a prod- uct. Reviewers share their experience by providing opinions and describing different aspects of the product. They can suggest how to use the prod- uct, or compare it to alternative products. While doing so, they may vary their writing style to em- phasize their viewpoint or argue for it. We suggest that systematic identification of these facets can unlock novel explainable analyses of downstream applications. Content realization in product reviews has been extensively studied through, for example, aspect extraction and sentiment analysis (Tubishat et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019), but very little research has centered on types of content within reviews, ex- cluding \u2018tips\u2019 and \u2018arguments\u2019 (Hirsch et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2017). We introduce a broad typology of sentence types for product reviews (\u00a72) consist- arXiv:2502.14335v1 [cs.CL] 20 Feb 2025"
