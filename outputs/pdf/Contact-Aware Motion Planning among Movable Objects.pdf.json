  "abstract": "\u2014Most existing methods for motion planning of mobile robots involve generating collision-free trajectories. However, these methods focusing solely on contact avoidance may limit the robots\u2019 locomotion and can not be applied to tasks where contact is inevitable or intentional. To address these issues, we propose a novel contact-aware motion planning (CAMP) paradigm for robotic systems. Our approach incorporates contact between robots and movable objects as complementarity constraints in optimization-based trajectory planning. By leveraging augmented Lagrangian methods (ALMs), we efficiently solve the opti- mization problem with complementarity constraints, producing spatial-temporal optimal trajectories of the robots. Simulations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art method, our proposed CAMP method expands the reachable space of mobile robots, resulting in a significant improvement in the success rate of two types of fundamental tasks: navigation among movable objects (NAMO) and rearrangement of movable objects (RAMO). Real-world experiments show that the trajectories generated by our proposed method are feasible and quickly deployed in different tasks. I. INTRODUCTION I NTERACTION with movable objects in an environment is a natural and essential human behavior. For instance, when navigating through a narrow space to reach the other side of a room, humans do not go around all objects in their path\u2014instead, they selectively push chairs or tables that obstruct their way. Additionally, in exploring unknown environments, humans can actively open a movable window or door, thus exploring previously inaccessible areas. For physical robotic systems, most existing planning meth- ods are insufficient to support the ability to interact with objects like humans in a complex environment. These contact- avoidance methods treat all objects in the scenario as static obstacles and always generate collision-free trajectories for the robot [1, 2, 3, 4]. While this strategy maximizes the safety of robot movement, it reduces the reachable space for the robot, limiting its mobility (as shown in Fig.1). In many tasks, such as navigating in a crowded room and pushing doors, it is inevitable or even necessary for the robot to make contact with movable objects in the environment. To efficiently accomplish these tasks and acquire locomotion capabilities like humans, the robot must possess contact-aware motion planning ability while preserving rational obstacle avoidance behaviors.

Fig. 1: Compare to contact-avoidance method, contact-aware motion planning allows a mobile robot to push movable objects actively in crowded environments. However, the existing research on contact-aware motion planning algorithms for robots is inadequate, especially in exploring methods to obtain feasible trajectories for contin- uous, smooth, and long-distance contact. Pioneering work by Stilman et al. [5] employed searching methods in a discrete action space to generate a sequence of primitive actions. While this high-level action planning effectively guides the robot to manipulate objects, ensuring the feasibility of trajectories be- tween adjacent discrete states remains challenging, particularly during make and break contact. Additionally, the feasibility of contacts in the trajectories is crucial for the precise execution of practical tasks by the robots, such as wheeled balancing robots [6] and bipedal robots [7]. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based contact-aware motion planning (CAMP) paradigm. CAMP leverages the information of movable objects in the environ- ment to produce feasible trajectories for a mobile robot that in- volve predictable contact. The contacts between the robot and movable objects are embedded into the trajectory optimization problem as complementarity constraints. We efficiently solve this complex problem using the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) [8, 9, 10, 11].
