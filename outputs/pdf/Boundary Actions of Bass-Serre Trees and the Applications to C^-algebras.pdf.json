  "abstract": ". In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of C\u2217-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associ- ated boundaries, through which, we identify new families of C\u2217-simple groups in- cluding certain tubular groups and fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic. In addition, we obtain charac- terizations of C\u2217-simplicity for Generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups and outer automorphism groups Out(BS(p, q)) of Baumslag-Solitar groups. These C\u2217-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. More- over, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these C\u2217-simple funda- mental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely in\ufb01nite crossed product C\u2217-algebras.

Introduction In recent years, there has been an increasing acknowledgment of the profound interplay between the \ufb01elds of group theory, topological dynamics, and C\u2217-algebras. Groups and topological dynamical systems have emerged as valuable sources of examples and motivations for exploring C\u2217-algebras, particularly through the con- struction of group C\u2217-algebras and crossed product C\u2217-algebras.
