Republica 252, Santiago,Chile 2Facultad de Ingenier\u00b4\u0131a y Empresa, Universidad Cat\u00b4olica Silva Henr\u00b4\u0131quez, Chile (Dated: February 13, 2025) A new regular black hole solution for Lovelock gravity with an n-fold degenerate ground state AdS is provided. An alternative definition of the Kretschmann scalar for this theory is proposed, which is associated with the gravitational tension of the Schwarzschild vacuum AdS of this theory, which diverges at the radial origin. The proposed energy density encodes the latter\u2019s information in such a way that it takes a finite value at the origin, thereby suppressing the existence of a central singularity. There is a value of the extremal radius, rext, which can be of the order of the Planck length, such that for a value r\u2217> rext, just slightly greater than it (also of the order of Planck), the solutions of the vacuum AdS black hole (BH) and our regular solution become indistinguishable. Thus, for realistic values of the horizon radius, both cases mentioned are numerically indistinguishable. However, at short length scales such that r < r\u2217, both behaviors differ. Therefore, the proposed matter sources lead to the formation of a de Sitter core rather than a central singularity. The thermodynamics of both cases become indistinguishable for r \u2265r\u2217, i.e., for realistic scales. However, at shorter scales r < r\u2217, quantum effects would arise, meaning that instead of the temperature evolving to infinity as in the vacuum AdS BH, the matter sources proposed in this work cause the cooling of the BH, through a phase transition, such that a BH remnant is reached at T = 0, which represents what remains of the BH once the evaporation process halts. I. INTRODUCTION Over the last 50 years, much has been discussed regarding how General Relativity and other theories of gravity can be improved to address theoretical inconsistencies and mismatches with observations. Naturally, in recent decades, there has been a growing interest in determining the role of the cosmological constant in the functioning of gravity. Although the expansion of the universe has usually been associated with a positive cosmological constant, this brings complications from a theoretical standpoint. Firstly, the presence of a positive cosmological constant may yield the existence of a cosmological horizon, which prevents the existence of an asymptotic regime, making the unambiguous identification of the ADM mass of a black hole problematic. Secondly, a positive cosmological constant is usually associated with negative pressure, implying thermodynamic instability. On the contrary, the presence of a negative cosmological constant offers good explanations for some physical ambiguities. A spacetime with a negative cosmological constant allows for the definition of an asymptotic boundary in the geometry of Penrose diagrams. In this context, the existence of an asymptotic boundary enables the correct definition of conserved charges [1], such as mass/energy. The existence of a well-defined boundary in an AdS universe has led to the development of the AdS/CFT theory. In broad terms, the AdS/CFT theory is a correspondence between a quantum theory defined in a certain class of anti-de Sitter space and a conformal field theory defined on its boundary with one lower dimension. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that in recent years, attention has been drawn to associating the thermodynamics of an AdS Schwarzschild space, where the negative cosmological constant has been linked to a positive thermodynamic pressure [2]. This has allowed for the study of phase transitions, where stable regions can be found. In this way, it is of physical interest to study how the presence of a negative cosmological constant influences the physical properties of black holes. On the other hand, The singularity theorem, see [3, 4], considered a triumph of theoretical physics, states in general terms that the collapse of matter could lead to the formation of singularities. However, it also suggests, broadly speaking, that the dynamics of gravity result in the breakdown of its predictability. To address this fundamental issue, one could argue that the prediction of singularities arises from the incompleteness of current theories of gravity. Although some theories that incorporate quantum effects, such as String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity, to name just two examples, provide fundamentally different solutions to the singularity problem, it is not necessary to have a fully developed (fundamental) quantum gravity theory to offer solutions to the existence of singularities. This leads to ideas associated with the fact that gravity should be modified at small distances, typically around \u2217raros@unab.cl \u2020 milko.estrada@gmail.com \u2021 b.astudilloespndola@uandresbello.edu arXiv:2502.07992v1 [gr-qc] 11 Feb 2025"
