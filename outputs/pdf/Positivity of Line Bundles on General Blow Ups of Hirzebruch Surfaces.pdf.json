  "title": "Positivity of Line Bundles on General Blow Ups of Hirzebruch Surfaces.pdf",
  "abstract": ". We investigate various positivity properties of line bundles on general blow ups of Hirzebruch surfaces motivated by [6], where the author has studied general blow ups of P2. For each of the properties: ampleness, global generation, very ampleness, and k-very ampleness, we provide several su\ufb03cient numerical conditions. 1. Introduction Positivity properties of line bundles on the blow up of projective varieties have been of signi\ufb01cant interest in the literature. There are several notions of the positivity of a line bundle, such as ampleness, global generation, very ampleness, and more generally k-very ampleness. We recall the de\ufb01nition of k-very ampleness. De\ufb01nition 1.1. A line bundle L on a projective variety X is said to be k-very ample if the restriction map H0(X, L) \u2192H0(X, L \u2297OZ) is surjective for all zero-dimensional subschemes Z \u2282X of length k + 1. Note that 0-very ampleness and 1-very ampleness of a line bundle are equivalent to the global generation and very ampleness, respectively. Let X be a surface and p1, p2, . . . , pr be r distinct points in X. Let \u03c0 : Xr \u2192X be the blow up of r distinct points on X. Then Pic Xr = \u03c0\u2217Pic X \u2295Z.E1 \u2295Z.E2 \u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Z.Er, where Ei = \u03c0\u22121({pi}) is the exceptional divisor corresponding to pi. So, a line bundle L on Xr has the form L = \u03c0\u2217(L) \u2212m1E1 \u2212\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212mrEr, where L \u2208Pic X. If mi = m for all 1 \u2264i \u2264r, we call L a uniform line bundle. The ampleness of a line bundle can be characterized in di\ufb00erent ways: geometrically (which we take as the de\ufb01nition), cohomologically (through the theorem of Cartan-Serre-Grothendieck), or numerically (using the Nakai-Moishezon-Kleiman criterion). Determining whether a given line bundle is ample is often challenging. Although the Nakai-Moishezon-Kleiman criterion provides a numerical condition, it involves an in\ufb01nite number of conditions to check. So, it is natural to look for a \ufb01nite number of su\ufb03cient conditions to check ampleness. In this article, we restrict our interest to surfaces. It is known that if the Nagata-Biran-Szemberg conjecture (see [18, Section 4.1]) holds for a surface X, then for a uniform line bundle L on the blow up of X at a su\ufb03ciently large number of points is ample if and only if L2 > 0 ([10, Theorem 3.1]). Several \ufb01nite conditions have been proposed for surfaces to determine ampleness of a line bundle. The case of P2 has been extensively studied by various authors. K\u00a8uchle ([13]) and Xu ([19]) independently showed that for the general blow up of P2, the line bundle L = \u03c0\u2217(OP2(d)) \u2212 E1 \u2212E2 \u2212\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212Er is ample if d \u22653. The conditions for global generation and very ampleness can be found in [3]. A complete characterization for very ampleness is given in [5, Proposition 3.2] when mi = 1 for all i. Later, Hanumanthu developed numerical criteria for the ampleness, global Date: February 6, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation. 14C20, 14E05, 14J26. Key words and phrases.
