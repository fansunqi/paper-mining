Introduction By an n-dimensional topological quantum \ufb01eld theory (TQFT), we mean a monoidal functor F \u2236Cobn \u00d0\u2192R\u2212mod, where Cobn is the category of n-dimensional cobordisms between (n\u22121)- dimensional manifolds, which we will write as (n \u22121)-manifolds, that are either oriented or unoriented, and R is a commutative ring. The target category R\u2212mod is the category of R-modules. It is easy to see that, for any (n \u22121)-manifold N, the module F(N) is a \ufb01nitely-generated projective R-module; see [GIK+23, Proposition 2.1] for n = 1, and the same argument works for any n. A one-dimensional oriented TQFT F is given by such a \ufb01nitely generated projective R- module P. Namely, if P = F(+), then its dual P \u2217\u2245F(\u2212), where + and \u2212are points viewed Date: February 6, 2025. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation.
