  "abstract": "\u2014This paper addresses the challenge of occluded robot grasping, i.e. grasping in situations where the desired grasp poses are kinematically infeasible due to environmental con- straints such as surface collisions. Traditional robot manipulation approaches struggle with the complexity of non-prehensile or bimanual strategies commonly used by humans in these circum- stances. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods are unsuitable due to the inherent complexity of the task. In contrast, learning from demonstration requires collecting a significant number of expert demonstrations, which is often infeasible. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), a learning-based approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate sta- bilising poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination. Specifically, during RL training for the grasping policy, the constraint policy\u2019s output is refined through gradients from a jointly trained value func- tion, improving bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy point cloud-based policies in real-world environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that COMBO- Grasp significantly improves task success rates compared to competitive baseline approaches, with successful generalisation to unseen objects in both simulated and real-world environments. I. INTRODUCTION Grasping objects with kinematically infeasible grasp poses due to environmental collisions, known as occluded grasp- ing [44], presents a significant challenge in robotics. Indeed, kinematic infeasibility arises from supporting surfaces, such as the table that the object is resting on. For example, grasping a keyboard that rests on a desk requires reorienting the keyboard with regard to the desk surface (nonprehensile manipulation) to reveal the grasp pose (see Figure 1). Humans exhibit exceptional dexterity in solving such occluded grasping prob- lems through coordinated bimanual manipulation, seamlessly using both hands to reposition objects for grasping. However, learning to acquire such coordinated skills for a bimanual robotic system poses significant challenges, particularly when using reinforcement learning (RL) [31, 18]. Specifically, compared to single-handed applications, bi- manual manipulation exhibits a significantly increased action space with coordination requirements adding to task com- plexity. These challenges are exacerbated when using domain randomisation [36] to enable sim-to-real transfer and render RL approaches infeasible due to sample inefficiency. For the occluded grasping task, these challenges are particularly pronounced as the policies must enable one arm to stabilise the object while the other reorients and grasps it.
