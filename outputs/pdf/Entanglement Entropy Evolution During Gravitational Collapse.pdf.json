(Dated: February 21, 2025) We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Our approach employs an Ermakov-like equation to determine the time- dependent ground state of the field and calculates the resulting entanglement entropy by tracing out the degrees of freedom inside a spherical region within the matter sphere. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits nontrivial scaling and time dependence during collapse. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling of entanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.

INTRODUCTION In classical thermodynamics, entropy is typically ex- tensive. However, dealing with quantum mechanical sys- tems, it is possible to argue an entropy that can be present even if the state of the entire system is known. In particular, a nonzero von Neumann entropy may gen- erally arise for discretized quantum fields if the overall degrees of freedom are divided into two distinct subsets, and the corresponding ground-state reduced density op- erators are derived. Accordingly, the associated entropy is named entanglement entropy and it quantifies the field quantum correlations, provided the state of the full sys- tem is pure [1, 2]. Early computations involving a free scalar field in flat spacetime [3] revealed that the resulting von Neumann entropy grows in proportion to the boundary area of the region which is traced out. This result was later con- firmed in the case of a spherical entangling surface by determining the reduced density matrix for the scalar field modes inside the sphere [4]. The emergence of such area law [5], typically up to subleading logarithmic corrections, is closely related to the locality of interac- tions in quantum many-body systems [6\u201310] and it man- ifests striking similarity with Bekestein-Hawking black hole entropy [11\u201316]. This resemblance has then fueled the idea that black hole entropy might be fundamentally entanglement-based, potentially connecting quantum in- arXiv:2502.14797v1 [gr-qc] 20 Feb 2025"
