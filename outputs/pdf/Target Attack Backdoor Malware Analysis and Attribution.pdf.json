  "abstract": "Backdoor Malware are installed by an attacker on the victim's server(s) for authorized access. A customized backdoor is weaponized to execute unauthorized system, database and application commands to access the user credentials and confidential digital assets. Recently, we discovered and analyzed a targeted persistent module backdoor in Web Server in an online business company that was undetectable by their deployed Anti-Virus software for a year. This led us to carry out research to detect this specific type of persistent module backdoor installed in Web servers. Other than typical Malware static analysis, we carry out analysis with binary similarity, strings, and command obfuscation over the backdoor, resulting in the Target Attack Backdoor Malware Analysis Matrix (TABMAX) for organizations to detect this sophisticated target attack backdoor instead of a general one which can be detected by Anti-Virus detectors. Our findings show that backdoor malware can be designed with different APIs, commands, strings, and query language on top of preferred libraries used by typical Malware. Keywords: Backdoor; Malware Analysis; Target Attack; APT 1. Introduction Backdoor Malware can exist on various devices ranging from a victim PC (which is compromised and become a bot controlled and accessible by the attacker), a server, an IoT device, or a mobile device. It can perform stealth activity including capturing the credentials, conversing with other systems and applications, and gathering more information to enable executing commands to query confidential databases and launching a further attack against other targets [1]. Recently, the threat of a backdoor developed with an IIS native module is increasing in prevalence [2]. We have been called for incident response and computer forensics by an online business company. We have found the IIS native module backdoor has been installed to the web server for at least six months without any detection until we have discovered the backdoor via the error logs, which is about failing to load the IIS native module backdoor with a compromised configuration file. The revealed backdoor comprises functions to access a database and modify table entries of a transaction. The backdoor allows an attacker to interact with it to execute various built-in SQL query commands against the application and database and database system administrator (SA) 1 VX Research Limited. {darkfloyd, alanh0, byronwai}@vxrl.hk 2 vitaly.kamluk@gmail.com 3 Singapore Management University. pfke@smu.edu.sg process take-over statement and create unauthenticated and authorized sensitive transaction records. In a typical Web application system architecture, we engage a three-tier design, and the data access layer is always deployed as a data access layer between a business logic layer in the Web application server and database [6]. It is not common to deploy at the Web Server layer (before the presentation layer). In certain scenarios, a native module is developed to have database tables or logs backup, temporary transaction table clean up and different database maintenance tasks. All existing controls including Windows Defender, Symantec Anti-Virus, and Firewall cannot detect the backdoor. It is challenging to detect such stealth passive backdoor. Typical malware can be easily detected by anti-virus as most of the malware samples are circulated publicly. Malware analysts and anti-virus product vendors can extract signatures and bytecode patterns to update the virus definition file of the anti- virus software. Unfortunately, target attack backdoor malware is not widely circulated and it is customized and deployed as a business legitimate module to access data of an organization. 1. Background"
