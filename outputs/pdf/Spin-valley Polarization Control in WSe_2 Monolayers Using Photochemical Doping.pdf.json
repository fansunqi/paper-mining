  "abstract": ". We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polar- ization degree (Pc) of excitons in WSe2 monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic de- pendence of Pc on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with Pc reaching a minimum value of less than 10% at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of 5\u00d71011 cm\u22122. The impact of the doping on Pc is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the domi- nant mechanism driving the observed variations in Pc, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Introduction. In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the local extrema of electronic bands in momentum space at the K+ and K\u2212points of the Brillouin zone are associated with a quantum number often termed \u201cval- ley pseudospin\u201d. This degree of freedom has attracted significant interest due to its potential to serve as an additional information carrier, complementing the elec- tron\u2019s charge and spin and offering opportunities for en- coding, processing, and storing information in emerg- ing valleytronic applications[1]. This concept mirrors spintronics, where the spin of electrons and their as- sociated magnetic moment introduces an additional in- trinsic degree of freedom[2]. The manipulation of val- leys is a well-established concept, historically involv- ing inversion layers at silicon/insulator interfaces[3], as well as strain[4] and magnetic fields in 2D electron-gas systems[5]. The primary aim of valleytronics is to de- velop systems that can provide clear advantages in terms of processing speed, energy efficiency, and information storage, thereby complementing and surpassing contem- porary semiconductor technologies based on charge and spin. The origin of the \u201cvalley pseudospin\u201d in TMDs lies primarily in the symmetry of electronic states near the K-points, complying with time inversion but requiring a broken inversion symmetry, a condition met in odd- numbered TMD layers[6]. Specifically, monolayers of TMDs exhibit a direct bandgap at the K+ and K\u2212points of the Brillouin zone, where chiral optical selection rules apply. These valleys can be selectively populated by cir- cularly polarized light with opposite helicity, enabling the optical generation and detection of valley polarization (as the spin and valley degrees of freedom are locked, we will use in the following the single term \u201cvalley\u201d)[7]. This phenomenon has been explored not only in lin- ear spectroscopy experiments[8, 9], but also in nonlin- ear studies[10\u201313]. Importantly, the optical response of TMD monolayers is primarily governed by excitons, i.e., Coulomb-bound electron-hole pairs[14]. Photolumines- cence (PL) experiments serve as a convenient tool to study the valley degree of freedom, where for one-photon transitions the exciton-photon coupling is determined by the symmetry of the excitonic wave functions[15]. Upon circular excitation, the imbalance between right (\u03c3+) and left (\u03c3\u2212) circularly polarized exciton emission intensity is measured to extract the valley polarization degree, Pc. The value of Pc is determined by the effective lifetime, \u03c4r, and the valley polarization lifetime, \u03c4v, through the equation[14]: Pc = P0 1 + \u03c4r \u03c4v , (1) where P0 is the initially generated polarization which reaches unity for close-to-resonance conditions in accor- dance with the selection rules[16]. Eq. (1) indicates that Pc is significantly influenced by the interplay between \u03c4r and \u03c4v. In particular, a high Pc typically requires a long arXiv:2502.03049v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 5 Feb 2025"
