Ng,1, \u2020 and Yu Cai1, \u2021 1School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637371 (Dated: February 5, 2025) Quantum key distribution requires tight and reliable bounds on the secret key rate to ensure robust security. This is particularly so for the regime of finite block sizes, where the optimization of generalized R\u00b4enyi entropic quantities is known to provide tighter bounds on the key rate. However, such an optimization is often non-trivial, and the non-monotonicity of the key rate in terms of the R\u00b4enyi parameter demands additional optimization to determine the optimal R\u00b4enyi parameter as a function of block sizes. In this work, we present a tight analytical bound on the R\u00b4enyi entropy in terms of the R\u00b4enyi divergence and derive the analytical gradient of the R\u00b4enyi di- vergence. This enables us to generalize existing state-of-the-art numerical frameworks for the optimization of the key rate. With this generalized framework, we show improvements in regimes of high loss and low block sizes, which are particularly relevant for long-distance satellite-based protocols. I. INTRODUCTION Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic method for establishing secret keys between two distant parties, com- monly called Alice and Bob, by exchanging quantum signals through a public quantum channel and using classical commu- nication over an authenticated public channel [1, 2]. An ad- versary, referred to as Eve, can fully access the classical com- munication and potentially interfere with the quantum chan- nel. Since the introduction of the first QKD protocol [1], QKD has evolved into various forms [3\u20136] to enhance performance, simplify implementation, and address vulnerabilities. A key performance metric for a QKD protocol is the secret key rate, defined as the ratio between the number of secret key bits and the number of raw quantum bits exchanged during the protocol. The secret key rate is determined by the full set of parameters governing the protocol such as noise and loss of the quantum channel, and assumptions on the attacking power of Eve. A central ingredient in formulating the key rate is the leftover hashing lemma [7, 8] which quantifies the number of secret bits distillable from privacy amplification requiring Eve has no knowledge of the final key. This quantification is expressed in terms of the smooth min-entropy which can be bounded by von Neumann entropy. The bound saturates in the asymptotic limit where the number of signals are in- finite, due to the asymptotic equipartition property [9]. Early works [10, 11] subsequently formally established the security for collective attacks and key rate formulas in the asymptotic regime. The security against general attacks are also estab- lished via the entropy accumulation theorem (EAT) [12\u201315] and the postselection technique [16]. Since imperfections in sources and detectors in a practical QKD setup are inevitable, it quickly became evident that ro- bust security proofs should be derived assuming that Eve may fully exploit such imperfections to her advantage [17, 18]. In essence, a practical QKD security proof necessitates fur- ther numerical optimizations based on the experimental pa- \u2217rebecca.chung@e.ntu.edu.sg \u2020 nelly.ng@ntu.edu.sg \u2021 yu.cai@ntu.edu.sg rameters estimated by the honest parties. This optimization considers the worst-case scenario where Eve exploits device imperfections to perform an optimal attack. Winick et al. [19] developed a reliable numerical framework to evaluate the von Neumann key rate under collective attack through a two- step approach involving semi-definite programming (SDP). George et al. [20] subsequently extended the framework by in- corporating finite size analysis, rendering it a highly valuable tool for evaluating the key rates of QKD implementations. In a recent work by Dupuis [21], it was shown that the key rate can be formulated directly in terms of the generalized R\u00b4enyi entropies via a R\u00b4enyi leftover hashing lemma. This new lemma eliminates the need for smoothing which is a chal- lenging optimization problem over quantum states, and avoids loose bounds associated with the von Neumann entropy in the finite-size regime. By optimizing over a single R\u00b4enyi param- eter \u03b1, this approach is expected to yield tighter bounds in the finite-size regime. Recent works [22\u201325] have incorpo- rated the R\u00b4enyi leftover hashing lemma into key rate analysis. However, the bounds on the R\u00b4enyi key rate remain loose, and numerical frameworks for the R\u00b4enyi entropy key rate evalu- ations remain undeveloped due to the inherent challenges in optimizing the R\u00b4enyi entropy. In this work, we address these challenges by generalizing the numerical framework initially proposed by Winick et al. [19] to include the optimization of the generalized R\u00b4enyi key rate. We derive a tight bound to the R\u00b4enyi entropy in terms of the R\u00b4enyi divergence and subsequently obtain an analytical ex- pression for its gradient. These inputs are then utilized in the Frank-Wolfe algorithm [26] as part of the minimization algo- rithm. Additionally, we incorporate the finite-size framework originally introduced by George et al. [20] into our analy- sis for collective attacks and using the open-source numerical package (openQKDsecurity) [27]. Consequently, we achieve an improvement in key rate, which we demonstrate to be perti- nent in practical scenarios, including in the presence of chan- nel loss and noise. This manuscript is organized as such: Section II provides the background of the basic QKD protocol framework, and Sec- tion III introduces the security proof formulation for R\u00b4enyi en- tropy key rate. In Section IV we introduce our technical re- sults and the formulation of the generalized framework. In arXiv:2502.02319v1 [quant-ph] 4 Feb 2025"
