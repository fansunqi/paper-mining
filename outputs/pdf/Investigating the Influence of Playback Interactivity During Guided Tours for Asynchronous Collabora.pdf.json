  "abstract": "Collaborative virtual environments allow workers to contribute to team projects across space and time. While much research has closely examined the problem of working in different spaces at the same time, few have investigated the best practices for collaborat- ing in those spaces at different times aside from textual and auditory annotations. We designed a system that allows experts to record a tour inside a virtual inspection space, preserving knowledge and providing later observers with insights through a 3D playback of the expert\u2019s inspection. We also created several interactions to ensure that observers are tracking the tour and remaining engaged. We conducted a user study to evaluate the influence of these interac- tions on an observing user\u2019s information recall and user experience. Findings indicate that independent viewpoint control during a tour enhances the user experience compared to fully passive playback and that additional interactivity can improve auditory and spatial recall of key information conveyed during the tour.

An area of interest over the years has been collaboration within immersive environments, where a plethora of new coopera- tive capabilities can be realized [16]. Coined as Collaborative Vir- tual Environments (CVEs), these digital landscapes allow multiple users to communicate with one another and interact with digital content through various interaction methods [8, 47, 53]. As a re- sult of the geographical distribution of work becoming more com- mon [54] in recent years, telepresence tools such as Zoom1 and We- bEx2 have been used to facilitate remote collaboration. Although these desktop-based collaboration applications help facilitate basic screen sharing and whiteboarding, they forfeit the benefit of em- bodied interaction, representation of information, and collaborators that CVEs provide for cooperative work [37, 17]. While a large amount of literature has focused on addressing the challenges of CVEs in the realm of synchronous collaboration [11], using CVEs for asynchronous collaboration has been identified as an area of limited exploration [24, 43]. CVEs have the potential to preserve increments of work [63], allow the annotation of knowl- edge and reasoning from individual contributions [34], draw collab- orator attention and awareness to these annotations [51], and enable ad-hoc communicative exchange and relaying of pertinent informa- tion to drive continuous work across all hours [35].
