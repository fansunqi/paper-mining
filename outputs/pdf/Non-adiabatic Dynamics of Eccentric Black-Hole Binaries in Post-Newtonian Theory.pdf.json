We present a new set of non-orbit-averaged equations, free from radiation-reaction gauge ambiguities, that accurately describe the evolution of orbital elements for eccentric, non-spinning black-hole binaries. We derive these equations by mapping the Keplerian orbital elements to a new set of characteristic parameters using energy and angular momentum definitions combined with near-identity transformations. The resulting framework is valid for arbitrary eccentricities, including parabolic and hyperbolic limits. Using this framework, we demonstrate the strictly observable effects of the non-adiabatic emission of gravitational waves \u2014characteristic of eccentric binaries\u2014 on the orbital parameters. Furthermore, we assess the regime of validity of the widely used orbit-averaged equations first derived by Peters in 1964. Importantly, their breakdown becomes evident at the first pericenter passage, implying that the validity of the orbit- averaged approximation cannot be inferred solely from binary initial conditions. The formalism we introduce, accurate up to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, aims to provide a robust tool for making reliable astrophysical predictions and accurately interpreting current and future gravitational wave data, paving the way for deeper insights into the dynamics of eccentric black hole binaries. I. INTRODUCTION A. Context Accurately describing the dynamics of non-spinning black holes (BHs) on eccentric orbits is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in astrophysics (see e.g. [1\u20135]). This problem has been approached from various perspec- tives over more than sixty years due to its critical impor- tance, particularly in the gravitational wave (GW) field [6\u2013 12]. For instance, a wide variety of formation channels for binary systems, ranging from stellar-mass [1, 13\u201319] to supermassive BHs [20, 21], predict their evolution on eccentric orbits. This highlights the need to understand eccentric system dynamics and the long-term evolution of their orbital parameters, which is the first step toward building accurate waveform templates for GW detections. The dynamics of binary BHs is typically described using balance laws: the energy and angular momentum carried away by GWs are equated to the corresponding losses in the energy and angular momentum of the orbit, which directly leads to the coalescence of the binary [22\u201326]. The seminal work by Peters [27] was among the first to apply balance laws to eccentric binaries, establishing the most widely used framework for their dynamics. This formalism employs a Newtonian description of the orbital energy and angular momentum, and leverages an orbit- average approximation to capture the secular evolution of the orbital elements [8, 28, 29]. \u2217g.fumagalli47@campus.unimib.it \u2020 nicholas.loutrel@unimib.it However, this approach has important limitations. The concept of averaging pre-dates Peters\u2019 work, and was originally proposed by Isaacson [30, 31] as a method for handling gauge effects in the definitions of energy and angular momentum from a suitably defined stress- energy tensor. Yet, this averaging procedure relies on the existence of a GW timescale that is longer than the timescale of gauge-dependent oscillations, allowing the deployment of multiple scale analysis [32] from which the secular (or averaged) approximation would constitute the leading order behavior. For generic binary systems, the latter is governed by the orbital timescale, while the former is the dissipative timescale associated with orbital energy loss due to GW emission, the so-called backreaction or radiation-reaction timescale. In nature, the requirement of separation of scales is not always met. Post-adiabatic corrections to the secular limit become important when constructing waveform templates [6, 8, 10, 33]. Further, for highly eccentric binaries, GW emission is concentrated during pericenter passage [34], and the timescale associated with the emission is thus shorter than the orbital period [35]. Even outside of the GW context, orbit averaging to obtain a secular approximation is well known to fail in three-body interactions [36], and more robust analysis methods have been developed to properly handle oscillatory orbital perturbations [37, 38], such as the perihelion precession of Mercury [39]. For an accurate description of binary dynamics, espe- cially from dynamical captures, a closer look is needed. The equations of motion have to be defined locally, within the near-zone \u2014a region enclosing the source and much smaller than the typical wavelength of the radiation emit- ted [23, 24]. There, the motion of the BHs is governed not only by their mutual Newtonian gravitational attraction, arXiv:2502.06952v1 [gr-qc] 10 Feb 2025"
