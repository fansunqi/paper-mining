This article identifies and conceptualizes seven online strategies employed in social media influence operations. These procedures are quantified through the analysis of 80 incidents of foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI), estimating their real-world usage and combination. Finally, we suggest future directions for research on influence operations. CCS Concepts: \u2022 Security and privacy \u2192Social network security and privacy.

Influence Operations in Social Networks. 1, 1 (February 2025), 11 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX 1 THE INFLUENCE CYBER BATTLEGROUND The rise of social media and other online communication channels has provided unprecedented reach and efficiency for intentional influence campaigns, having an important escalation from Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Governments are worried about these risks and social platforms seriously fight against the so-called coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) [28]. In 2023, the landscape of influence operations saw a significant rise in detected Foreign In- formation Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) incidents, with the European External Action Service (EEAS) report [12] identifying 750 cases between December 1, 2022, and November 30, 2023, nearly doubling the previous year\u2019s figures. FIMI attacks were globally distributed, targeting 53 countries, with Ukraine, the United States and several European nations being the most affected. The content dissemination involved the coordinated use of websites and social media to create illusions of authentic discourse and obscure origins, with cross-platform reach as a standard practice. Unfortunately, this global threat is expected to be massively automated with generative artificial intelligence, as stated by OpenAI [17], Microsoft [22] or Google [18]. Consequently, the study of online influence operations has grown in the last few years [16]. Existing case studies have focused on characterizing disinformation methods, inferring strategies Authors\u2019 Contact Information: Javier Pastor-Galindo, Computer Systems Engineering Department, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Pantaleone Nespoli; Jos\u00e9 A.
