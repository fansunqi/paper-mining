In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections. INTRODUCTION Quantum fluctuations are fundamental to modern physics, shaping many key phenomena. In QCD, gluon field fluctuations are key to quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. In the non-perturbative regime, they influence quark and gluon dynamics within nucle- ons, affecting their distributions and interactions. These effects, in turn, shape how nucleons respond to external probes like photons and weak bosons. When energy al- lows, quantum fluctuations can manifest as real particles, such as pions, in electroproduction and weak production. Pion production is of particular interest, as pions, being Nambu-Goldstone boson of QCD, reflect chiral symme- try spontaneous breaking and play a crucial role in chiral dynamics (see, e.g., [1]). The study of pion production through electromagnetic interactions has a long history. Low-energy theorems (LETs) successfully described charged pion photoproduc- tion but initially failed for the \u03b3p \u2192\u03c00p process [2\u20137]. Bernard et al. resolved these discrepancies by incorpo- rating chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) corrections [8\u2013 13], advancing our understanding of QCD chiral dynam- ics, where quantum fluctuations (i.e, pion loops) are of prime importance. Increasing beam energies in recent electron-nucleon experiments have made it more chal- lenging to probe pion production directly in the threshold region. The latest photoproduction data from MAMI, over a decade old [14], only cover energies above the sec- ond threshold, where the \u03c0+n channel opens. For a re- cent review, see [15]. For electroproduction, where the photon carries nonzero four-momentum squared, the sit- uation is less clear. While the extension of the LETs to electroproduction and the ChPT analyses of exper- imental data exist [16\u201320], discrepancies among differ- ent measurements and deviations from ChPT predictions persist [21], prompting further theoretical efforts [22\u201324]. Lattice QCD calculations offer a first-principles approach to predicting threshold pion electroproduction, enabling direct comparisons with experiment and ChPT. Such comparisons are essential for improving our understand- ing of chiral dynamics in QCD. Weak pion production is crucial for neutrino os- cillation experiments, where neutrino-nucleus interac- tions are a major source of systematic uncertainty. This impacts both intermediate-energy experiments like LBNF/DUNE [25], HyperK [26], and JUNO [27], as well as low-energy coherent neutrino scattering pro- grams [28, 29]. The DUNE Conceptual Design Report highlights that uncertainties exceeding 1% for signals and 5% for backgrounds could significantly reduce sensitivity to CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy [25]. A significant portion of the DUNE neutrino flux lies above the pion production threshold, making precise theoretical understanding of pion production processes crucial. To achieve few-percent overall cross-section uncertainties, these processes must be understood at the ten-percent level [30]. New data on neutrino scattering off proton or deuteron targets would provide valuable constraints, Theoretically, LETs are detailed in [31]. While lattice QCD can offer crucial insights, current studies of ma- trix elements involving nucleon-pion rescattering states remain exploratory compared to axial form factor cal- culations. Theoretical and computational advances are required to deliver results with fully quantified uncer- tainties. Lattice QCD calculations involving baryonic multi- hadron states are inherently challenging due to increased system complexity, poorer signal-to-noise ratios, and po- tentially significant excited-state contamination.
