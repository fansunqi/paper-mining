  "title": "High Quality Single Crystal of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Material RuBr3 Synthesized under High Pr.pdf",
  "abstract": "Kitaev quantum spin liquids have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics over the past decade. To understand their emergent quantum phenomena, high-quality single crystals of substantial size are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate RuBr3, achieving millimeter-sized crystals through a self-flux method under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The crystals exhibit well-defined cleavage planes with a lustrous appearance. Transport characterizations exhibit a narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior with 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV band-gap in ab plane and along c axis, respectively. Magnetic measurement shows a transition to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at approximately 29 K both in ab plane and along c axis. Notably, the N\u00e9el temperature increases to 34 K with an applied magnetic field of up to 7 T in the ab plane, but without any change along c axis. The large size and high quality of RuBr3 single crystals provide a valuable platform for investigating various interactions, particularly the Kitaev interaction, and for elucidating the intrinsic physical properties of Kitaev quantum spin liquids."
