  "abstract": "We show that for every graph H, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class CH of unbounded treewidth such that the H-free (i.e., excluding H as an induced sub- graph) graphs of CH have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of un- bounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer t, there is a hereditary graph class Ct of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph H of treewidth at most t, the H-free graphs of Ct have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples. 1 Introduction A possible reading of the Grid Minor theorem of Robertson and Seymour [22] is that for every class C of unbounded treewidth there is a family F of subdivided walls of unbounded treewidth, such that every graph of F is a subgraph of some graph in C. Said informally, this identifies the subdivided walls as the unavoidable subgraphs witnessing large treewidth. Recently, some effort has been put into unraveling the unavoidable induced subgraphs of classes of unbounded treewidth; see for instance the series \u201cInduced subgraphs and tree de- compositions\u201d [2]. In this line of research, the holy grail would be a hereditary family F\u2217(analogous to the class of all subdivided walls in the subgraph case), ideally comprising a few canonical families of unbounded treewidth, such that for every class C of unbounded treewidth there is a subfamily F \u2286F\u2217of unbounded treewidth with the property that every member of F is an induced subgraph of some graph in C. A first inspection reveals that F\u2217has to contain 1 arXiv:2502.14775v1 [math.CO] 20 Feb 2025"
