  "abstract": "\u2014We consider time-optimal controls of a controllable linear system with a scalar control on a long time interval. It is well-known that if all the eigenvalues of the matrix describing the linear system dynamics are real then any time-optimal control has a bounded number of switching points, where the bound does not depend on the length of the time interval. We consider the case where the governing matrix has purely imaginary eigenvalues, and show that then, in the generic case, the number of switching points is bounded from below by a linear function of the length of the time interval. The proof is based on relating the switching function in the optimal control problem to the mean motion problem that dates back to Lagrange and was solved by Hermann Weyl.

INTRODUCTION Consider the single-input linear control system 9x \u201c Ax ` bu, (1) with x : r0, 8q \u00d1 Rn, A P Rn\u02c6n, b P Rn, and u : r0, 8q \u00d1 r\u00b41, 1s. We assume throughout that the system is controllable [4]. Fix arbitrary p, q P Rn, and consider the problem of \ufb01nding a measurable control u, taking values in r\u00b41, 1s for all t \u011b 0, that steers the system from xp0q \u201c p to xpT q \u201c q in minimal time T . It is well-known that such a control exists and satis- \ufb01es uptq \u201c sgnpmptqq, where the switching function m : r0, T s \u00d1 R is given by mptq \u201c pJptqb, (2) where the \u201cadjoint state vector\u201d p : r0, T s \u00d1 Rnzt0u of the Pontryagin maximum principle satis\ufb01es 9pptq \u201c \u00b4AJpptq. (3) Under the controllability assumption, mptq has a \ufb01nite number of zeros on any open time interval, so a time-optimal control is \u201cbang-bang\u201d, with switching points at isolated time instants ti such that mptiq \u201c 0. An interesting question is to determine the number of switching points in the interval r0, T s, denoted NpT q. This has important implications. For example, it is well-known [1, The- orem 6-8] that if all the eigenvalues of A are real then NpT q \u010f n \u00b4 1 for all T \u0105 0, implying that the solution of the time-optimal control problem reduces to the \ufb01nite-dimensional problem of determining up to n \u00b4 1 values t1, . . . , tn\u00b41. Furthermore, bounding the number of switching points in time- optimal controls is also important for nice reachability results, The authors are with the School of Elec.

Typically the value of the adjoint state vector is not known explicitly, so it is natural to study an \u201cabstract\u201d switching function mpt; p, b, Aq :\u201c pJe\u00b4Atb (4) with p, b P Rnzt0u and A P Rn\u02c6n. The zeroes of the switching function are called the switching points. Here, we consider the case where all the eigenvalues of the matrix A are purely imaginary. Our main contributions include the following: \u201a We develop a new approach for analyzing the zeros of mptq using the classical, yet generally forgotten, problem of mean motion that was solved by Hermann Weyl in 1938 [9]; \u201a Using this new approach we show that generically the number NpT q of switching points on the interval r0, T s satis\ufb01es NpT q \u011b cT for all suf\ufb01ciently large T, (5) where c is a positive constant. Our approach also provides a closed-form expression for c in terms of integrals of Bessel functions. The next section reviews the mean motion problem includ- ing the Bohl\u2013Weyl\u2013Wintner (BWW) formula that allows to derive an explicit expression for c. For the sake of complete- ness, we include more details on the proof of this formula in the Appendix. Section III states and proves the main result. The \ufb01nal section concludes, and describes some directions for further research. We use standard notation. Rn [Cn] is the n-dimensional vector space over the \ufb01eld of real [complex] scalars, and we abbreviate R1 to R [C1 to C]. For a complex number z P C, |z| is the absolute value of z, and argpzq is the argument of z, so the polar representation of z is z \u201c |z|ei argpzq. Also, Repzq [Impzq] denotes the real [imaginary] part of z, and \u00afz \u201c |z|e\u00b4i argpzq is the complex conjugate of z. Vectors [matrices] are denoted by small [capital] letters. The transpose of a matrix A is AJ. II. PRELIMINARIES In this section, we review several results from the theory of mean motion that will be useful for the analysis of time- optimal controls. A.
