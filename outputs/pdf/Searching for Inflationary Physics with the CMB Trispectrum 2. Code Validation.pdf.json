In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non- Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3. I. INTRODUCTION If new physics occurs in the early Universe, how can we detect it? One of the most attractive options is via \u2018primordial non-Gaussianity\u2019 (PNG, [e.g., 3\u20136]) \u2013 distortions to the fiducial distribution of curvature perturbations induced by new particles, new interactions, or new vacuum states during inflation. As shown by various experiments including COBE, WMAP, and Planck [e.g., 7\u201314], the large-scale temperature and polarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) appear consistent with Gaussian statistics, thus any deviations must be small. That said, they may still be non-zero, and there exist many non-trivial inflationary models capable of satisfying the current CMB bounds. Whilst there is only one way for a distribution to be Gaussian, there are many ways for it to be non-Gaussian. The simplest signature of PNG is a non-vanishing skewness, or, in multiple dimensions, a non-trivial three-point function (or bispectrum). This statistic has been extensively studied in both theoretical and observational contexts, and has been used to place bounds on a wide variety of inflationary phenomena (see [4] for a review), such as additional fields (local PNG), self-interactions (equilateral and orthogonal PNG) and non Bunch-Davies vacua (folded PNG). Whilst the bispectrum is a very powerful tool, it is by no means the only statistic. Another option (that is the subject of this work) is the four-point function (or trispectrum), which is a higher-dimensional analog of the kurtosis. This describes the correlations between fluctuations at four points in space, and can be sourced by many effects such as primordial particle exchange, new particles uncoupled to the inflaton, chiral physics, gravitational lensing, and self-interactions protected by symmetries (as summarized in [1]). Of course, one can continue to higher-order; though the five- and six-point functions do not appear to contain much new information, some features such as rare particle production can only be probed by looking at the tails of the primordial curvature distribution, essentially probing N-point correlation functions at very high N [e.g., 15\u201318]. Despite its strong theoretical motivations, the inflationary trispectrum has received far less attention than the inflationary bispectrum. This is particularly true observationally: whilst more than 50 types of bispectra have been searched for in CMB data [e.g., 5, 7\u201311, 14, 18\u201340], direct analyses of the four-point function have been restricted to just five models: two local shapes, one constant template [20], and two Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFT; [e.g., 41, 42]) interactions [9\u201311, 20, 21, 29, 32]. Moreover, CMB polarization has been included in only one analysis [22]. The relative sparsity of trispectrum analyses is partly due to practical considerations: na\u00a8\u0131ve computation of a four-point function from data has O(N 4 pix) complexity, which is clearly infeasible given that current data have Npix \u2248107 pixels. As such, it is vital to develop efficient estimators for trispectrum non-Gaussianity. Whilst efficient estimators exist for computing the binned and modal trispectrum [20, 43\u201345] (which were used to place constraints on some primordial models in [38, 39]), compressing the data in this fashion can be lossy and computationally inefficient [cf. 37], thus it is \u2217ohep2@cantab.ac.uk arXiv:2502.05258v1 [astro-ph.CO] 7 Feb 2025"
