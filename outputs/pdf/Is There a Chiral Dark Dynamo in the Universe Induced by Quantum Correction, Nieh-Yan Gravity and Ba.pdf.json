  "abstract": "Previously, Bombagcino et al. (2021) investigated the role of Immirzi parameter when promoted to a field in Einstein-Cartan-Holst black hole. In this framework they found that the Immirzi field acts similar to the axion field, as both axial pseudo-vector and vectorial torsion trace appear to be expressed in terms of the 4-gradient of the Immirzi parameter. In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the previ- ous work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the quantum correction proportional to the 4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple analytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equa- tions incorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of quantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass squared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late universe, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan theory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi parameter to a constant BI parameter. Addi- tionally, we derive analytical solutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that magnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic field at the QCD phase is found out of 1017 G, without quantum correction. Furthermore, from this dark mag- netogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass of the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as an Immirzi field 11.
