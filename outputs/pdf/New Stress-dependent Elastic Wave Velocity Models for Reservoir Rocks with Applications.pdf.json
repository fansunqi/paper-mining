  "abstract": "This study presents new elastic velocity-effective stress laws for reservoir rocks. These models are grounded in previously established correlations be- tween elastic modulus and porosity, which incorporate critical porosity. The accuracy of the models is validated against wave velocities from 38 core sam- ples, yielding coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.9994 for compressional wave and 0.9985 for shear wave. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the max- imum uncertainties for compressional and shear waves are less than \u00b15.5% and \u00b17.5%, respectively. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed models, a case study was conducted on three wells in the Northern Carnarvon Basin, where the new elastic wave velocity-effective stress laws produced reli- able predictions for velocity logs in the studied formations. The relationships reported herein may prove beneficial for hydrocarbon exploration, produc- tion, and ensuring drilling safety in both unconventional and conventional fields.
