  "abstract": "\u2014This paper investigates the deep learning based approaches for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The quality-of-service (QoS) constrained sum- rate maximization problems are, respectively, formulated for power-splitting (PS) receivers and time-switching (TS) receivers and solved by a unified graph neural network (GNN) based model termed SWIPT net (SWIPTNet). To improve the performance of SWIPTNet, we first propose a single-type output method to reduce the learning complexity and facilitate the satisfaction of QoS constraints, and then, utilize the Laplace transform to enhance input features with the structural information. Be- sides, we adopt the multi-head attention and layer connection to enhance feature extracting. Furthermore, we present the implementation of transfer learning to the SWIPTNet between PS and TS receivers. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of key components in the SWIPTNet. Numerical results also demonstrate the capability of SWIPTNet in achieving near- optimal performance with millisecond-level inference speed which is much faster than the traditional optimization algorithms. We also show the effectiveness of transfer learning via fast convergence and expressive capability improvement. Index Terms\u2014Deep learning, SWIPT, GNN, transfer learning. I. INTRODUCTION A. Background With the explosive growth of mobile devices, enhancing the wireless communication performance becomes an urgent need for large-scale wireless networks. Especially, in Internet of Things (IoT) involving huge number of low-power wireless devices, the wireless networks account for both information transfer and energy supply, which makes the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) an impor- tant topic for future communication system [1]. The power- splitting (PS) and time-switching (TS) receivers are two classic SWIPT receivers [2], which are, respectively, suitable for high efficiency and easy implementation. Thanks to the deployment of the multiple antennas, the energy of radio frequency (RF) signals can be concentrated on the desired locations via beam- focusing, which greatly enhances the dual functions of SWIPT Hong Han, Yang Lu and Zihan Song are with the School of Computer Sci- ence and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing 100044, China (e- mail: 24120330@bjtu.edu.cn, yanglu@bjtu.edu.cn, 23120405@bjtu.edu.cn).

Via frequency spectrum sharing, the trade-off between interference mitigation and utilization draws great attentions in SWIPT networks, which makes the transmit design the central role. In the past decade, the convex (CVX) optimization theory has been widely adopted to develop the transmit de- sign for SWIPT networks [4]. Although the (near-)optimality can be achieved by the CVX-based algorithms, the iterative framework hinders the implementation of these algorithms to realize the real-time signal processing for practical time- varying wireless scenarios. Recently, applying deep learning (DL) to optimize wireless networks has emerged as a revolutionized technology to design resource allocation algorithms [5]. The neural networks can be trained to learn and store the capability of solving the specific optimization problems via supervised [6] or unsupervised learning [7]. The well-trained neural networks have been vali- dated to realize near-optimal and real-time resource allocation for several wireless networks. For instance, in [8], the fully connected multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) were trained to approximate the non-linear mapping from the channel state information (CSI) to power allocation scheme to maximize the sum-rate in interference channel. In [9], the convolu- tional neural networks (CNNs) were utilized to approximate the iterative processes of weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm to address the maximization of system utility for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Numerical results show that the two DL models are much faster than the WMMSE algorithm but with negligible performance loss. However, the MLPs and CNNs may be unable to scale to a larger problem size unseen during the training phase due to fixed input setting and suffer intolerable generalization loss in complicated wireless networks due to limited feature extracting capability. Unfortunately, the SWIPT networks involve multiple user equipments (UEs) frequently switching between active and inactive status and dual-functional services sharing the same resource budget. Therefore, developing powerful DL models to allocate resource becomes a crucial consideration for DL- enabled SWIPT networks. B. Related Works Thus far, the DL-enabled transmit design for wireless networks has been widely investigated in existing works. In addition to supervised learning in [8] and [9], some works attempted to adopt unsupervised learning to alleviate the burden to acquire labeled training samples.
