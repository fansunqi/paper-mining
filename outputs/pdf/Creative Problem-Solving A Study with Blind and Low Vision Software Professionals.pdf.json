  "abstract": "\u2014Background: Software engineering requires both technical skills and creative problem-solving. Blind and low- vision software professionals (BLVSPs) encounter numerous workplace challenges, including inaccessible tools and collabo- ration hurdles with sighted colleagues. Objective: This study ex- plores the innovative strategies employed by BLVSPs to overcome these accessibility barriers, focusing on their custom solutions and the importance of supportive communities. Methodology: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 BLVSPs and used re\ufb02exive thematic analysis to identify key themes. Results: Findings reveal that BLVSPs are motivated to develop creative and adaptive solutions, highlighting the vital role of collaborative communities in fostering shared problem-solving. Conclusion: For BLVSPs, creative problem-solving is essential for navigating inaccessible work environments, in contrast to sighted peers, who pursue optimization. This study enhances understanding of how BLVSPs navigate accessibility challenges through innovation.

INTRODUCTION In software development, creativity and problem-solving have been found to be crucial to overcome challenges resulting from its inherent complexity [1], [2], in addition to technical expertise [3]. The value of creative problem-solving manifests in solving unsolved problems, improving existing solutions, or enhancing ef\ufb01ciency [4]. Within organizations, creativity results from individual and contextual factors [5], [6]. Software researchers have noted that personality traits such as openness to experience can predict a developer\u2019s creativity intention [7]. Equally important is fostering an environment that supports creativity, such as minimizing interruptions to enable the \ufb02ow state crucial for individual innovation [8], or bene\ufb01ting from a leader who employs an ambidextrous leadership style [9]. In recent years, the software profession has recognized its diversity crisis [10], and research about disability in soft- ware engineering remains relatively scarce compared to other factors of diversity, equity, and inclusion [11]. Among the sparse literature are studies about Blind and Low Vision Soft- ware Professionals (BLVSPs) which document the challenges that arise due to inaccessible tools and ableist attitudes of colleagues [11], [12]. As an example, many programming tools have accessibility \ufb02aws, such as hard-to-use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that hinder code naviga- tion [13]. Additionally, screen readers \u2014assistive technologies that convert visual displays into audio or braille \u2014 can place a signi\ufb01cant cognitive burden on BLVSPs [14]. Heeding the call for more research on disability in Software Engineering [11], this study follows up on prior work in which we conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 BLVSPs about Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solutions they built and used to deal with workplace inaccessibility [15]. While analyzing the data, we identi\ufb01ed creative problem-solving as an underlying theme in the responses. To the best of our knowledge, this aspect remains understudied in addressing workplace accessi- bility issues. This study presents results from a re-analysis of the interviews, explicitly focusing on creativity as the central theme while drawing upon established frameworks for understanding creative approaches. We asked the following research question: How do blind and low vision software professionals employ creative problem-solving strategies to adapt development tools and environments to enhance productivity? This study contributes to the \ufb01eld in the following ways: \u2022 Investigating and showcasing the creative problem- solving strategies employed by BLVSPs. \u2022 Offering insights into how BLVSPs adapt to and over- come accessibility challenges. \u2022 Bridging the domains of software development creativity and accessibility research by highlighting the distinctive work\ufb02ow patterns of BLVSPs."
