The method is based on mapping the Dalitz plot to a unit disk, and the difference of the disk distributions of two related decays isolates purely symmetry breaking effects. We demonstrate this method by extracting the fundamental parameter Q, an isospin breaking ratio of light quark masses defined as Q2 \u2261(m2 s \u2212\u02c6m2)/(m2 d \u2212m2 u) with \u02c6m the average of up and down quark masses, from the decays \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212and \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c00\u03c00. With the Dalitz plot distributions for these two decays reported by BESIII, we obtain Q = 22.3 \u00b1 0.7, which is consistent with previous determinations and has a comparable uncertainty. With the full BESIII data set, which is eight times larger than the one used here, a significantly more precise determination of Q will be achievable. This promising and novel method can be generalized to other three-body decays to extract symmetry breaking effects. I. INTRODUCTION As experimental particle physics advances towards in- creasingly precise measurements, further phenomenolog- ical developments are essential to interpret the results accurately. It is in this context that the Dalitz plot method [1, 2] was developed, and it has since become a widely used tool to for analyzing three-body decays in modern particle physics. While this method has proven valuable for visualizing various phenomena, its utility can be further enhanced through targeted improvements. One notable feature of the Dalitz plot is that its area and shape depend on the masses of the particles involved. Here, we propose a novel approach: by applying a suit- able change of variables, the Dalitz plot can be mapped onto a unit disk. This unit disk can then be discretized into bins. For two three-body decays related by a symme- try, their normalized Dalitz plot distributions can both be mapped onto unit disks. By taking the bin-by-bin dif- ference between these distributions, a new unit disk dis- tribution is obtained, which isolates symmetry-breaking effects. Then symmetry breaking parameters can be ex- tracted from such a distribution. As an example, we apply this method to the \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 decays to extract one important parameter of the Stan- dard Model, the double ratio Q2 \u2261(m2 s \u2212\u02c6m2)/(m2 d \u2212 m2 u) [3] (corresponding to 1/\u03ba in Ref. [4]) of light quark masses, where \u02c6m \u2261(mu + md)/2 is the averaged up \u2217adolfo guevara@uaeh.edu.mx \u2020 Corresponding author: fkguo@itp.ac.cn \u2021 jinghaojie@sxu.edu.cn and down quark masses. In this way, one can make use of the whole Dalitz plot information to extract the symmetry breaking effects, well beyond using only the branching fractions, B(\u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212) = (42.5\u00b10.5)% and B(\u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c00\u03c00) = (22.4 \u00b1 0.5)% [5]. As will be demon- strated, applying this method to the published BESIII data on the decays \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212and \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c00\u03c00 re- ported in Ref. [6] allows for a determination of Q2 with a 3% uncertainty. A significantly more precise determina- tion will be achievable once the full BESIII \u03b7\u2032 data set [7], which is eight times larger than that used in Ref. [6], is released. Thus, the unit disk mapping proposed in this Letter represents a promising and novel approach for pre- cisely extracting the quark mass ratio. For a comprehen- sive review of precision tests of fundamental physics using \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 decays, we refer to Ref. [8]. II. ISOSPIN BREAKING IN \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 DECAYS Isospin symmetry requires that the u and d quarks are identical. Nevertheless, their electric charges and masses differ, leading to two sources of isospin-breaking effects: electromagnetic interactions and the mass difference be- tween the up and down quarks. Both contributions can be systematically studied using chiral perturbation the- ory (ChPT) [9\u201311] with virtual photons [12]. It has been shown that electromagnetic corrections to the extraction of the Q parameter from isospin breaking (IB) \u03b7 \u21923\u03c0 decays are negligibly small, at the percent level of the isospin-breaking effects stemming from the quark mass difference [13]. Analogously, we can assume that electro- magnetic effects in \u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 decays will also be negli- arXiv:2502.02837v1 [hep-ph] 5 Feb 2025"
