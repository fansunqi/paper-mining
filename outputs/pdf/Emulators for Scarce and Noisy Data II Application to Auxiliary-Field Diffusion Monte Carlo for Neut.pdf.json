Reliable data analyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the EOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear inter- actions directly to the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively larger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as Auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the EFT truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This work will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions. Introduction. The equation of state (EOS) of pure neu- tron matter (PNM) is a key input to constrain proper- ties of neutron stars (NSs), such as their masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities [1\u20134]. This is because neutron- star properties are dominated by the neutron-star core where proton fractions are small. Using observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Ob- servatory (LIGO) [5, 6] or NASA\u2019s Neutron Star In- terior Composition Explorer (NICER) [7\u201311], one can extract neutron-star properties, and hence, constrain the EOS [10, 12\u201320]. The coming decades will provide even more astrophysical data from current and next- generation observatories, such as Cosmic Explorer [21, 22] and the Einstein Telescope [23, 24], ushering in a data-rich era for neutron stars that will allow us to fur- ther constrain the EOS. To properly analyze and ex- tract robust nuclear-physics information from this multi- messenger data, it is important to provide statistically meaningful EOS priors with a strong foundation in un- certainty quantification. At low densities, the neutron-matter EOS can be cal- culated using nuclear Hamiltonians from chiral effective field theory (EFT). Chiral EFT is a systematic expan- sion for nuclear forces and describes nuclear interactions in neutron matter up to densities of about two times the nuclear saturation density, nsat \u223c0.16 fm\u22123 [26\u2013 29]. Chiral EFT Hamiltonians depend on a set of pa- rameters, called low-energy couplings (LECs), that are usually calibrated to scattering data and properties of atomic nuclei [30\u201334]. Using chiral EFT Hamiltonians, \u2217itews@lanl.gov FIG. 1. Full propagated error bands for the energy per par- ticle of PNM as function of number density at 68% and 90% confidence intervals. The red band shows the mean and 68% uncertainty of Ref. [25] using a Gaussian Process error pre- scription [26]. one can then employ a quantum many-body method to solve for the EOS of PNM. Here, we employ accurate and precise quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [35], and in particular, auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) [36], to obtain the energy per particle in PNM. Importantly, the use of chiral EFT interactions enables uncertainty estimates due to the truncation of the EFT expansion, reflecting our incomplete knowledge of nuclear interactions. [26, 37].
