  "abstract": "Let A and B be subsets of the symmetric group Sn and r a positive integer. If for every g \u2208Sn, there are precisely r pairs (a, b) \u2208A \u00d7 B such that g = ab, then we say that A divides rSn; the subset B is called a code with respect to A and we write rSn = A \u00b7 B. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck [3, Conjecture 2.3] about codes in Sn. Let n > 2k and let j be such that 2j \u2a7dk < 2j+1. Suppose that X = xSn is a conjugacy class in Sn and Yk is the subgroup Sk \u00d7 Sn\u2212k of Sn, where the factor Sk permutes the subset {1, . . . , k} and the factor Sn\u2212k permutes the subset {k + 1, . . . , n}. We show that rSn = X \u00b7 Yk if and only if the cycle-type of x has exactly one cycle of length 2i for 0 \u2a7di \u2a7dj and all other cycles have length at least k + 1. Key words: code; Cayley graph; representation of the symmetric group 1 Introduction In a \ufb01nite graph \u0393 a perfect code is a set C of vertices such that every vertex of \u0393 is at distance at most 1 from a unique vertex in C. This generalizes the classical notion of a perfect t-error correcting code in the Cayley graph H(n, q, t) [3] and leads naturally to the study of perfect codes in Cayley graphs. Given a \ufb01nite group G and a subset A of G, the (directed) Cayley graph Cay(G, A) of G with respect to the connection set A is de\ufb01ned to have vertex set G, with an edge from g to h if and only if gh\u22121 \u2208A. Therefore, Cay(G, A) has no loops if and only if 1G \u0338\u2208A, where 1G is the identity element of G. A subset B of G is a perfect code in Cay(G, A) if and only if every element of G can be written uniquely as a product ab with a \u2208A and b \u2208B. More generally, for a positive integer r, if each vertex of Cay(G, A) has exactly r (outer) neighbours in B, or equivalently, for every g \u2208G there are precisely r pairs (a, b) \u2208A \u00d7 B satisfying g = ab, then B is called a code [4, 8] with respect to A and we write rG = A \u00b7 B (hence r = 1 means B is a perfect code). We also say that A divides rG if rG = A \u00b7 B. The study of (perfect) codes in a Cayley graph Cay(G, A) has received quite a bit of attention due to its strong connections with coding theory, group theory, and graph theory. [4] gives a nice exposition of their relationship and the history of research development E\u2013mail address: tfangfm@foxmail.com 1"
