  "abstract": ". We prove a homogenization result in terms of two-scale Young measures for non-local integral functionals. The result is obtained by means of a characterization of two-scale Young measures. Keywords: Homogenization, non-local functionals, relaxation, two-scale Young measures, \u0393- convergence 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation: 49J45, 26B25, 74G65 February 19, 2025 1. Introduction and Main Results Homogenization has attracted much attention in last \ufb01ve decades, due to the many applica- tions that mixtures and \ufb01nely heterogeneous media have in applied science and technology, see for instance [31] and [18] among a wider pioneering literature. In fact both classical and more recent theories of ferro-magnetics and mechanics provide an accurate macroscopic description of phenomena occuring in materials which incorporate \ufb01ne structures at the mi- croscopic level. We refer to [2, 6, 8, 11, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26] for applications to the theory of structured deformations, thin structures, non simple materials, evolution problems with nonstandard growth, elastomers, electromagnetic phenomena and constrained models. Here we want to adopt the homogenization techniques to formalize how the e\ufb00ects at micro-level emerge at the macro-level in the study of more general phenomena, such as peridynamics, where classical gradient are replaced by non classical one and, consequently non-local integral functions take over the role of standard integrals. Indeed, adopting a di\ufb00erent view point than [13], the aim of this paper consists of studying the asymptotic behavior as \u03b5 \u0581 0+ of I\u03b5 : Lp(\u2126; Rd) \u2192R+ de\ufb01ned as I\u03b5(u) := \u00a8 \u2126\u00d7\u2126 W \u0012 x, x\u2032, x \u03b5 , x\u2032 \u03b5 , u(x), u(x\u2032) \u0013 dxdx\u2032 (1.1) where \u2126\u2282RN, is an open subset, u : \u2126\u2192Rd is in some Lebesgue space Lp, 1 < p < \u221e and the integrand W : \u2126\u00d7 \u2126\u00d7 RN \u00d7 RN \u00d7 Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192[0, +\u221e) has some measurability and continuity properties to be speci\ufb01ed later and W(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u03be, \u03b7) is periodic in the \ufb01rst two variables, i.e. we will equivalently denote I\u03b5 by I\u03b5(u) = \u00a8 \u2126\u00d7\u2126 W \u0012 x, x,\u2032 Dx \u03b5 E , Dx\u2032 \u03b5 E , u(x), u(x\u2032) \u0013 dxdx\u2032, where \u27e8t\u27e9denotes the vector in (0, 1)N whose components are the fractional parts of t \u2208RN. 1"
