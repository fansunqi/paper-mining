  "abstract": "In 1995, D. Jerison and C. Kenig in [10] considered the the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem \u2206u = f on \u2126, u = 0 on \u2202\u2126in Lipschitz domains. One of their main results shows that the W 1,p estimate holds for the sharp range 3 2 \u2212\u03b5 < p < 3 + \u03b5 for d \u22653 and 4 3 \u2212\u03b5 < p < 4 + \u03b5 if d = 2. Although the argument employed in [10] yield optimal results, they rely on an essential fashion on the maximum principle and, as such, do not readily adapt to higher-order case. By using a new method, the aim of this paper is to establish an extension of their theorem for higher order inhomogeneous elliptic equations on bounded Lipschitz and convex domains, uniform W \u2113,p estimates are obtained for p in certain ranges. Especially, compare to the result in [19] for biharmonic equation, a larger, sharp, range of p\u2032s was obtained in this paper.
