  "abstract": "We study the quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the twisted D(2) 2 algebra (or simply the D(2) 2 model) under generic open boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian of this model can be factorized into the sum of two staggered XXZ spin chains. Applying the t-W method, we derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations for the zeros of the transfer matrix eigenvalues and the patterns of the corresponding zeros of the staggered XXZ spin chain with generic integrable boundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and excitation energies of the D(2) 2 model in di\ufb00erent regimes of boundary parameters.
