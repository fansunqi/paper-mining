  "title": "Multi-band Study of the Flaring Mode Emission in the Transitional Millisecond Pulsar PSR J1023+0038.pdf",
  "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of the flaring mode of the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1023+0038 during its X-ray sub-luminous state, using strictly simultaneous X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations. The X-ray flares exhibit UV and optical counterparts and coincide with the brightest radio flare observed in the past decade, reaching 1.2 mJy at 6 GHz and lasting \u223c1 hour. During the flare, the optical polarisation drops from \u22431.4% to \u22430.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarised component. We propose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring observed in tMSPs, enhances the ionisation level of the disc, thereby generating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be channelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet mass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The radio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet. We infer radio polarisation upper limits (<8.7%, <2.3%, and <8.2%, before, during, and after the radio flare) that further support a compact jet origin but do not rule out discrete ejections. Our findings suggest that tMSPs could serve as essential laboratories for investigating jet-launching mechanisms, mainly because they operate under very low mass accretion rates. This accretion regime has not been explored before in the context of accretion-ejection coupling.

Introduction PSR J1023+0038 (J1023) is the archetypal transitional millisec- ond pulsar (tMSP). It was classified as a tMSP following the detection of radio pulsations revealing a 1.69-ms spin period neutron star (NS) in a 4.75-hour binary system (Archibald et al. 2009). In 2013, J1023 underwent a sudden multi-wavelength flux increase, accompanied by the disappearance of its ra- dio pulsations and the appearance of optical emission lines. This change marked a transition to a peculiar state charac- terised by the presence of an accretion disc and an average X-ray luminosity of 1033\u221234 erg s\u22121, known as the X-ray sub- luminous state (Stappers et al. 2014). In this state, J1023 shows three X-ray luminosity modes (Linares 2014; Archibald et al. 2015; Bogdanov et al. 2015; Coti Zelati et al. 2018; Papitto et al. 2019): high (\u223c7\u00d71033 erg s\u22121, 70\u201380% of the time); low (\u223c1033 erg s\u22121, 20\u201330%); and flaring (\u22731034 erg s\u22121, 1\u20132%). X- ray, UV, and optical pulsations at the NS spin period are detected only in the high mode and in flaring mode, even though at low significance (Papitto et al. 2019; Miraval Zanon et al. 2022; see also Ambrosino et al. 2017; Jaodand et al. 2021). Radio and mil- limetre observations reveal bright continuum emission with an anti-correlation between the radio and X-ray bands: higher radio flux is observed during the low mode, with the spectrum shift- ing from flat (\u03b1 \u223c0, where \u03b1 is the spectral index) to inverted (\u03b1 > 0; Bogdanov et al. 2018). The radio emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation originating from a Blandford & K\u00f6nigl (1979)-type \u2018compact jet\u2019 in the high mode and discrete ejecta in the low mode (Fender et al. 2004, see also Baglio et al. 2023). To explain the behaviour of J1023, recent scenarios pro- pose the presence of an always-active radio pulsar (Papitto et al. 2019; Veledina et al. 2019; Baglio et al. 2023). In the high mode, pulsed X-ray/UV/optical emission originates from synchrotron- emitting regions in a shock whereby the pulsar wind interacts Article number, page 1 arXiv:2502.06953v1 [astro-ph.HE] 10 Feb 2025"
