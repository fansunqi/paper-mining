  "abstract": ". A two-term functional equation for an in\ufb01nite series involving the digamma function and a logarithmic factor is derived. A modular relation on page 220 of Ramanujan\u2019s Lost Notebook as well as a corresponding recent result for the derivative of Deninger\u2019s function are two main ingredients in its derivation. An interesting integral H (x), which is of independent interest, plays a prominent role in our functional equation. Several alternative representations for H (x) are obtained. 1. Introduction A Kronecker limit formula for a zeta function concerns evaluating the constant term in the Laurent series expansion around its pole, the simplest of which is the one for the Riemann zeta function determined by \u03b6(s) = 1 s \u22121 + \u03b3 + \u221e X j=1 (\u22121)j j! \u03b3j(s \u22121)j, (1.1) where, \u03b3j, j \u2208N \u222a{0}, are Stieltjes constants, and \u03b30 := \u03b3 is the Euler constant. Kronecker limit formulas have been obtained for various zeta functions. Hecke was the \ufb01rst mathematician to derive it for the zeta function associated with an imaginary quadratic \ufb01eld. While he also obtained the corresponding formula for a real quadratic \ufb01eld, his result was not very explicit as it involved the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function \u03b7(z). Later, Zagier [32] obtained an explicit formula for real quadratic \ufb01elds. Applications of Kronecker limit formulas include the solution to Pell\u2019s equation (the construction of a fundamental unit of a real quadratic \ufb01eld), \ufb01nding class numbers of number \ufb01elds, determining Hecke L-values etc. Zagier\u2019s version of the Kronecker limit formula for a real quadratic \ufb01eld involved a curious analytic function F(x), now known as the Herglotz-Zagier function. For x \u2208C\\(\u2212\u221e, 0], it is de\ufb01ned by F(x) := \u221e X n=1 \u03c8(nx) \u2212log(nx) n , (1.2) where \u03c8(x) := \u0393\u2032(x)/\u0393(x) is the logarithmic derivative of the Gamma function \u0393(x), also known as the digamma function. Since [1, p. 259, formula 6.3.18], for | arg z| < \u03c0, \u03c8(z) \u223clog z \u22121 2z \u2212 1 12z2 + 1 120z4 \u2212 1 252z6 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (1.3) as z \u2192\u221e, we see that the series in (1.2) converges absolutely. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation.
