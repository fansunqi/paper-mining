When the isospin chemical potential is large enough, a phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate of pions takes place. Currently available results in the literature on the phase diagram and the equation of state in this setup employ staggered fermions. We present preliminary results on the onset of the pion condensation phase in simulations with Wilson fermions.
