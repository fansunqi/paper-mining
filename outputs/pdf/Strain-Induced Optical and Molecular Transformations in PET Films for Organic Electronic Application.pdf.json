  "abstract": "Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films are widely used in flexible electronics and optoelectronics, where their mechanical durability and optical performance under strain are essential for device reliability. This study investigates the impact of applied mechanical strain on the optical and molecular properties of PET at room tempera- ture, using UV-Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The work explores how vary- ing strain levels, from 0% (unstretched) to 30%, affect the transparency, vibrational modes, and molecular reorganization within PET films. UV-Vis absorbance measure- ments reveal that strain induces significant changes in the light transmission properties of PET, particularly in the visible range, and increases absorption in the UVA and vis- ible region by up to 100%. Raman spectra indicate that strain levels higher than 5% lead to irreversible shifts of vibrational lines, accompanied by an increase of their full width at half maximum (FWHM), suggesting molecular reorientation and crystallinity 1 arXiv:2502.10113v1 [physics.app-ph] 14 Feb 2025"
