  "title": "Soft X-ray Imager of the Xtend System Onboard XRISM.pdf",
  "abstract": "The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is the X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for the soft X-ray imaging telescope Xtend installed on the X- ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which was adopted as a recovery mission for the Hitomi X-ray satellite and was successfully launched on 2023 September 7 (JST). In order to maximize the science output of XRISM, we set the requirements for Xtend and \ufb01nd that the CCD set employed in the Hitomi/SXI or similar, i.e., a 2 \u00d7 2 array of back-illuminated CCDs with a 200 \u00b5m-thick depletion layer, would be practically best among available choices, when used in combination with the X-ray mirror assembly. We design the XRISM/SXI, based on the Hitomi/SXI, to have a wide \ufb01eld of view of 38\u2032 \u00d7 38\u2032 in the 0.4\u201313 keV energy range. We incorporated several signi\ufb01cant improvements from the Hitomi/SXI into the CCD chip design to enhance the optical-light blocking capability and to increase the cosmic-ray tolerance, reducing the degradation of charge-transfer ef\ufb01ciency in orbit. By the time of the launch of XRISM, the imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the SXI has been extensively studied in on-ground experiments with the full \ufb02ight-model con\ufb01guration or equivalent setups and con\ufb01rmed to meet the requirements. The optical blocking capability, the cooling and temperature control performance, and the transmissivity and quantum ef\ufb01ciency to incident X-rays of the CCDs are also all con\ufb01rmed to meet the requirements. Thus, we successfully complete the pre-\ufb02ight development of the SXI for XRISM.
