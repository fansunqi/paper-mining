  "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a crucial analytical technique used for molecular structure elucidation, with applications spanning chemistry, biology, materials science, and medicine. However, the frequency resolution of NMR spectra is limited by the \"field strength\" of the instrument. High-field NMR instruments provide high-resolution spectra but are prohibitively expensive, whereas lower-field instruments offer more accessible, but lower-resolution, results. This paper introduces an AI-driven approach that not only enhances the frequency resolution of NMR spectra through super- resolution techniques but also provides multi-scale functionality. By leveraging a diffusion model, our method can reconstruct high-field spectra from low-field NMR data, offering flexibility in generating spectra at varying magnetic field strengths. These reconstructions are comparable to those obtained from high-field instruments, enabling finer spectral details and improving molecular characterization. To date, our approach is one of the first to overcome the limitations of instrument field strength, achieving NMR super-resolution through AI. This cost-effective solution makes high-resolution analysis accessible to more researchers and industries, without the need for multimillion-dollar equipment. Keywords Artificial Intelligence \u00b7 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \u00b7 Diffusion Model \u00b7 Super Resolution 1 Introduction Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely utilized analytical technique for elucidating molecular structures [1, 2]. By exploiting the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, NMR provides rich information about molecular dynamics, chemical environments, and atomic connectivity. As a non-destructive technique, NMR has broad applications across various fields including chemistry, biology, materials science, and medicine. In chemistry, NMR is commonly used for identifying molecular structures, analyzing purity, and studying chemical reactions [2, 3]. In biology, it plays a critical role in the study of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules, often aiding in understanding complex processes [4]. NMR\u2019s applications also extend to material science, where it helps characterize polymers, solid-state materials, and surfaces [5]. Furthermore, in medicine, NMR principles are foundational for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a key diagnostic tool in clinical settings [6]. Despite its versatility, the performance of NMR spectroscopy, especially in terms of frequency resolution, is closely tied to the field strength of the instrument used [7]. Frequency resolution refers to the ability of the instrument to resolve closely spaced resonance peaks, which is crucial for accurately identifying and characterizing molecules. Higher field strengths provide better resolution, allowing researchers to distinguish between subtle variations in chemical environments and obtain finer details about molecular structures. For example, high-field NMR instruments offer exceptional spectral clarity, resolving complex overlapping signals. However, such instruments come at a significant cost, often ranging from millions to tens of millions of dollars, making them inaccessible to many research institutions and industries 2. \u2217yansen0508@gmail.com 2https://www.brucker.com arXiv:2502.06845v1 [physics.ins-det] 6 Feb 2025"
