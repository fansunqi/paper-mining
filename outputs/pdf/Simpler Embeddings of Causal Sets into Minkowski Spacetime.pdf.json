  "abstract": "We present a new method for embedding a causal set into Minkowski spacetime. The method is similar to a previously presented method, but is simpler and provides better embedding results. The method uses space- time volumes to define causal set analogs of time coordinates for all ele- ments, and spatial distances for pairs of causally related elements. The spatial distances for causally related pairs are then used to derive spatial distances for spaceliked separated pairs by applying the triangle inequal- ity. The result is a matrix of spatial distances for all pairs of elements in the causal set. This distance matrix can be decomposed to give co- ordinates in Minkowski spacetime. Results are presented showing good quality embeddings into Minkowski spacetime for dimensions d = 2, 3, 4.

Spacetime events are represented by elements of a causal set\u2014a locally finite, partially ordered set in which the partial order represents the causal relationships between events in spacetime.
