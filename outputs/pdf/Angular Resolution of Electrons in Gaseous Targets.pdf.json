  "abstract": "Vahsen\u2020 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Hawaii, 2505 Correa Road, Honolulu, HI, 96822, USA (Dated: February 19, 2025) Low-energy electron recoils are of interest in several planned and proposed future nuclear and particle physics experiments. The topology and directions of such recoils provide important particle identification and kinematical constraints, and are experimentally accessible in gaseous targets. Electron recoils have complex trajectories, and the angular resolution that can be achieved has not been well understood. We have developed a method for estimating and optimizing this angular resolution, considering contributions from both multiple scattering and detection. First, we clarify that the formula commonly used for multiple scattering through small angles is actually a fit to Moliere theory for heavy particles. We revise this formula so that it is applicable to electrons in gas. Next, we combine this with an effective point resolution contribution, which accounts for diffusion and detector effects, to obtain an approximation for the angular resolution. We identify the optimal fit length and the corresponding optimal angular resolution. The result is a simple formula to estimate the best achievable angular resolution for electrons in gaseous detectors, given the electron energy and basic gas and detector properties. Our model\u2019s predictions show good agreement with simulations. This approach can assist in the design of future experiments and the development of analysis techniques. Given the widespread use of gaseous detectors, this work is relevant to many scientific communities. I. INTRODUCTION When a free electron traverses a gaseous medium, it undergoes multiple scattering, altering its trajectory and generating a track of secondary, ionized electrons. This fundamental process plays a crucial role in vari- ous fields of physics, influencing beam halo formation at particle accelerators [1], dose rate calculations in medi- cal physics [2], and signal degradation in near-ambient pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy [3]. It is also essential for detecting electron tracks in gaseous targets used in rare-event searches. An electron recoil occurs when an incident particle\u2014 such as a gamma ray, neutrino, or dark matter particle\u2014 transfers energy to an atomic electron. This electron then propagates through the target medium, producing a cloud of secondary ionization that may be fully contained in the target. In the low-energy regime (1 \u2212100 keV) electron recoils constitute a dominant background in weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches. Developing strategies to reject electron recoils is therefore a major challenge for future experiments [4]. Recently, however, electron recoils have been recognized as a potential signal for new dark matter interactions, including those predicted via the Migdal effect [5]. The topology of electron recoils contain valuable in- formation, yet remains difficult to measure. The recoil length and charge density can help distinguish electron recoils from nuclear recoils [6\u201312]. Furthermore, the di- rections of nuclear recoils can provide evidence for the galactic origin of dark matter and help discriminate be- \u2217majd@hawaii.edu \u2020 sevahsen@hawaii.edu tween dark matter and solar neutrinos [13\u201317]. Recently, interest in directional electron recoil detec- tion has increased. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Ex- plorer (IXPE) [18] uses electron directionality to mea- sure astrophysical X-ray polarization. The directional detection of electron recoils in gaseous detectors also has potential for solar neutrino measurements [19, 20]. Addi- tionally, the MIGDAL experiment [21] aims to precisely measure the directions of overlapping nuclear and elec- tron recoil tracks. Detecting the directions of low-energy electron recoils requires gaseous detectors, where the recoil length ex- ceeds the diffusion scale of the secondary ionization. Modern micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) of- fer the necessary spatial resolution and sensitivity to reconstruct recoil topology down to the keV scale [22]. In gaseous time projection chambers with MPGD-based readouts, the ionization trail can be reconstructed in three dimensions [23]. Two primary factors limit the angular resolution of electron recoils in gaseous detectors: the multiple scatter- ing of the primary electron and the detector resolution for secondary ionization measurements. Somewhat surpris- ingly, we find that the commonly used formula for mul- tiple scattering through small angles fails to accurately describe electron recoils at the 100 keV scale. Given the growing interest in utilizing electron recoils for funda- mental physics, an updated scattering formula is critical for optimizing future experiments. Additionally, it is nec- essary to understand how detector resolution and recon- struction techniques impact angular resolution. Since the complex topology of electrons recoils makes them chal- lenging to analyze, the method of direction reconstruc- tion also significantly affects the achievable resolution. Both conventional and machine learning approaches have been explored for this purpose [20, 23, 24]. arXiv:2502.12387v1 [physics.ins-det] 17 Feb 2025"
