  "abstract": "Today\u2019s global supply chains face growing challenges due to rapidly changing market conditions, increased net- work complexity and inter-dependency, and dynamic uncer- tainties in supply, demand, and other factors. To combat these challenges, organizations employ Material Require- ments Planning (MRP) software solutions to set inventory stock buffers \u2013 for raw materials, work-in-process goods, and finished products \u2013 to help them meet customer service levels. However, holding excess inventory further compli- cates operations and can lock up millions of dollars of cap- ital that could be otherwise deployed. Furthermore, most commercially available MRP solutions fall short in consid- ering uncertainties and do not result in optimal solution for modern enterprises. At C3 AI, we fundamentally reformulate the inventory management problem as a constrained stochastic optimiza- tion. We then propose a simulation-optimization framework that minimizes inventory and related costs while maintain- ing desired service levels. The framework\u2019s goal is to find the optimal reorder parameters that minimize costs sub- ject to a pre-defined service-level constraint and all other real-world operational constraints. These optimal reorder parameters can be fed back into an MRP system to drive optimal order placement, or used to place optimal orders directly. This approach has proven successful in reducing inventory levels by 10-35 percent, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of economic benefit for major enterprises at a global scale. 1. Introduction Global supply chain faced enormous challenges due to uncertainties introduced by the shocks in both supply side and demand side during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sup- ply shock hit as the pandemic first emerged from main- land China and disrupted global supply. Over the ensu- ing months, global shutdowns and stay-at-home orders trig- gered a second shock, this time to the global demand. These two waves of unprecedented disruptions to the global sup- ply chains exposed the inherent volatility of such networks. With this volatility to be continued in the post-pandemic era, a solution is required to handle uncertainties in the global supply chains. While battling the uncertainties by in- creasing capital spent on raising the inventory level, the en- terprises begin to pay more attention at the concept of lean manufacturing which includes maximizing the resilience of the inventory availability while minimizing the amount of capital expenditure on inventory held. Current practice in today\u2019s supply chains suffer from numerous issues covering aspects including suppliers, transportation, manufacturing, distribution and customers (Fig. 1). Perturbations in each of the aspects are hardly spe- cific only to itself. The network nature of the supply chains makes any issue in each of these aspects easily propagate and amplify upstream or downstream. On one direction, dynamic demand and order changes would impact produc- tion schedules and inventory management at manufacturing sites or distribution centers. In addition, available inven- tory and production requirements would inform supplier or- ders. The equipment reliability, product quality issues, and shipment uncertainties would impact part orders. On the other direction, supplier uncertainties and delays would af- fect production schedules, while order delays and quality issue would risk customer satisfaction. Furthermore, mate- rial movement delays would strain the entire supply chain. The Lack of end-to-end operational visibility would lead to delays across supply chains, excess inventory levels, quality issues, poor OTIF, or low customer satisfaction. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is at the heart of the process in today\u2019s supply chain systems. MRP uses a deterministic logic that calculates the time and quantity of the orders that need to be placed, based on net material re- quirement, re-order parameters, current inventory, demand forecast and other inputs (Fig. 2). MRP computes material requirements based on demand forecast and schedules the arrivals as close as possible to the time they will be con- sumed. Re-order parameters such as Safety Stock Value (SSV) and Safety Time (ST) for the Safety Stock MRP sys- tem, or Reorder Point (RoP) for the Reorder Point MRP system are used as inputs to MRP to address the uncertain- 1 arXiv:2502.11213v1 [math.OC] 16 Feb 2025"
