  "abstract": ". We theoretically explore the properties of heralded number states including up to three photons that are generated from single-mode twin beams. We investigate the effects of different parameters involved in the state preparation by using the fidelity, normalized second-order factorial moment of photon number for the heralded state (g(2) h ), and photon-number parity as figures of merit. Especially, the photon-number parity offers a practical and robust tool for inferring the target state quality by capturing the contamination of all undesired photon-number contributions. We focus on expressing our results in terms of experimentally easily accessible parameters such as the coincidences-to-accidentals ratio and the detection efficiencies. Our results identify the optimal parameter regions for generating high quality photon- number states and provide useful insights for advancing their use in quantum technologies. Keywords: photon counting, number states, photon-number parity 1. Introduction The generation and precise characterization of quantum optical states are foundational in order to advance the implementation of technologies for quantum information processing, quantum communication, and precision metrology [1]. For this purpose, single- and few-photon states are particularly interesting as they serve as indispensable resources [2]. These states can be produced for example by heralding on one of the twin photons generated in non-linear optical processes, such as parametric down-conversion (PDC) [3] or four-wave mixing [4]. However, until today the generation of high-quality photon-number states remains challenging due to experimental imperfections, which introduce undesirable vacuum, one and multi-photon contributions [5\u20137]. The accurate characterization of the photon-number statistics of these heralded states is essential for the optimization and best exploitation of the photonic sources. arXiv:2502.11631v1 [quant-ph] 17 Feb 2025"
