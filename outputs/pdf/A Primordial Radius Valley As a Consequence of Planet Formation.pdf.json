  "title": "A Primordial Radius Valley As a Consequence of Planet Formation.pdf",
  "abstract": "The radius distribution of close-in planets has been observed to have a bimodal distribution with a dearth of planets around \u223c1.5- 2.0 R\u2295commonly referred to as the \u201dradius valley\u201d. The origin of the valley is normally attributed to mass-loss process such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Recent work, however, has suggested that the radius valley may instead arise as a consequence of gas accretion by low-mass planets. In this work we therefore aim to investigate the formation of a primordial radius valley from the formation of planet cores through pebble accretion up until the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc and subsequent contraction of accreted atmospheres. The goal of this work is to explore the conditions for forming a primordial radius valley from first principles of planet formation theory, rather than attempting to explain the detailed structure of the observed valley. We use an analytical model with minimal assumptions to estimate the contraction rate of atmospheres and, indeed, find the formation of a primordial radius valley. The planets smaller than the valley did not reach the pebble isolation mass, which is required for the planets to cool down sufficiently to be able to accrete a significant amount of gas. We also estimate the slopes of the radius gap as a function of orbital period for the intrinsic population as well as for planets with orbital periods <100 days. For the intrinsic population, the radius gap follows the pebble isolation mass and increases with increasing orbital period, while for close-in planets the direction of the slope reverses and decreases with increasing orbital period. We find that planets smaller than the radius valley are predominantly rocky while the population of planets larger than the valley consists of a mixture of rocky and water-rich planets.

Introduction The Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010) has given us a lot of in- sight into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. One of the key findings from the Kepler mission is the apparent lack of planets with radii in the range \u223c1.5-2.0 R\u2295, for orbital periods <100 days (Fulton et al. 2017). This is commonly referred to as the \u201dradius valley\u201d. Follow-up studies, utilising precise stel- lar parameters from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) and more precise planet radii measurements confirmed these findings and found that the location of the valley increases with increas- ing stellar masses and decreases with increasing orbital periods (Fulton & Petigura 2018; Berger et al. 2020a; Ho & Van Eylen 2023). Observed planets smaller than \u223c1.6 R\u2295have been inferred to have a rocky composition. In contrast, larger planets have too low densities to be composed mainly of metals and sili- cates, which implies that larger planets require an atmosphere of low mean molecular weight to explain their masses and sizes (Rogers 2015; Wolfgang & Lopez 2015). Further, only a small atmosphere mass fraction (\u223c1-3%) is required in order to inflate the radius significantly, thereby doubling the size of the planet (Lopez & Fortney 2014; Owen & Wu 2017). This indicates that planets smaller than the radius valley have very light to no at- mospheres, while planets larger than the radius valley host an atmosphere with a mass fraction of at least \u223c1%. Attempts to explain the radius valley have therefore focused on trying to understand how planets lose their atmospheres, pop- ulating the smaller end of the radius valley. There have been two major mechanisms that both shape the distribution of planetary radii during their evolution: photoevaporation (Lopez & Fortney 2013; Owen & Wu 2013, 2016, 2017) and core-powered mass loss (Ginzburg et al. 2018; Gupta & Schlichting 2019, 2020, 2021; Gupta et al. 2022). After the pressure support of the disc is removed, gas at the Bondi radius will escape at the Bondi rate. In order to sustain mass-loss, the remaining gas needs to ex- pand out towards the Bondi radius. Such an expansion requires a supply of heat. The mass loss in the photoevaporation model is mainly driven from high-energy flux from the star, accelerating the atoms in the atmosphere, which causes heating, expansion and an outflow. Core-powered mass loss is instead mainly driven by the remaining thermal energy of the planet, combined with the bolometric illumination by the central star (Ginzburg et al. 2016, 2018). The position of the radius gap has been observed to decrease with increasing orbital period (Fulton et al. 2017; Pe- tigura et al. 2022), which both mass loss models are able to pre- dict (Owen & Wu 2017; Gupta & Schlichting 2019). However, Cloutier & Menou (2020) found that the radius gap increases with increasing orbital period for M-dwarfs, which might hint towards a separate planet formation process for planets around these types of stars as an increasing radius gap with increasing orbital period is generally predicted by planet formation after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc (Lopez & Rice 2018). The two presented mass loss models nevertheless predict dif- ferent dependencies on the stellar mass. As the core-powered mass loss mechanism is driven by the planet\u2019s internal energy as Article number, page 1 of 24 arXiv:2502.10186v1 [astro-ph.EP] 14 Feb 2025"
