  "abstract": "\u2014This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of LUCAS, a low-power, ultra- low jitter ASIC optimized for SiPM readout in Time-of-Flight Computed Tomography (ToF-CT) applications. Leveraging a novel preamplifier design with low input impedance and current- mode operation, LUCAS addresses challenges such as parasitic capacitance of SiPMs and high-speed detection requirements. The ASIC, fabricated in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology, features eight channels with an integrated preamplifier and comparator, achieving an SPTR of 201 ps FWHM at 3.2 mW/ch. Experimen- tal validation includes input impedance measurements, SPTR testing with a pulsed laser source, and energy-to-Time-over- Threshold calibration using monoenergetic X-ray sources. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LUCAS in enhancing timing resolution while minimizing power consumption, offering significant advancements for high-resolution ToF-CT imaging.

INTRODUCTION Computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in both clinical and pre-clinical medical imaging, offering high spatial resolution, fast scanning, and relatively low costs [1]. In conventional CT, X-ray photons are emitted from a continuous source, pass through the body, and are detected on the opposite side. Ideally, some of these X-ray photons are absorbed by dense tissues, such as calcified structures, transferring their entire energy. A detector on the opposite side then correlates the level of absorption with tissue density, allowing image reconstruction to produce detailed anatomical images. However, a phenomenon known as scattering can compli- cate CT imaging. Scattering occurs when an X-ray photon does not transfer its entire energy to biological structures but instead delivers only part of its energy before deviating [2], eventually being detected in a different pixel [3]. This scatter- ing introduces noise and artifacts into the images [4], reducing image quality and making medical diagnoses less certain. Methods to address the scattering problem in CT imaging have been extensively discussed in the literature, with a comprehensive review available in [5]. These solutions fall into two primary categories: 1) Mechanical Approaches: These methods involve physical modifications to the imaging setup aimed at either pre- venting or reducing the reception of scattered photons. This can be accomplished by adding specific structures to the detector side, such as anti-scatter grids [6] or beam stop arrays [7], or to the source side, like Bowie filters [8], [9]. Another technique involves adjusting the scanner\u2019s diameter using the air gap method [10]. How- ever, a significant drawback of these approaches is that they tend to decrease the detector\u2019s sensitivity to X-ray photons. Consequently, there\u2019s often a need to increase the radiation dose to offset this reduced sensitivity, which is not ideal. 2) Post-Processing Solutions: This category focuses on es- timating the distribution of scattered photons in the final data and then attempting to remove them [11]\u2013[14]. These approaches are based on estimation, tend to be costly, subject-dependent, and depend on complex computations. In 2018, the Universit\u00b4e de Sherbrooke introduced a novel approach to address the issue of scattered photons in CT imaging. This method employs high-speed electronics to dif- ferentiate scattered photons from primary photons (those that pass through the body without deviation) [3], [15]. Termed \u201dTime of Flight CT\u201d (ToF CT), this technique uses a pulsing X-ray source, rather than a continuous one, and measures the time it takes for the X-ray photons to reach the detector. Scat- tered photons, due to their deviation caused by the scattering phenomenon, travel a longer distance and consequently have a longer time of flight (Figure 1). By implementing a specific time window, the system can distinguish scattered photons from primary ones, effectively reducing noise and improving image quality [3]. As a result, the system\u2019s time resolution is directly related to its ability to distinguish between scattered and primary photons [16]. Highlighting the significance of time resolution, according to the data published in [3], when the system possesses a temporal resolution of 200 picoseconds (ps) at Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), there is an observed decrease in the scattered to the primary ratio (SPR) by 60%, whereas standard anti-scatter grids (as a commercially available solution) typ- ically achieve a 70 to 95% but at the expense of sensitivity reduction, which decreases to 15 to 30% [17]. As a result, the system\u2019s time resolution is directly related to its ability to distinguish between scattered and primary photons [16]. From an electronics perspective, the chief impediment to high-resolution detection is the photodetector. Among vari- ous mature options, the Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) has demonstrated superior timing performance while maintaining arXiv:2502.02762v1 [eess.SP] 4 Feb 2025"
