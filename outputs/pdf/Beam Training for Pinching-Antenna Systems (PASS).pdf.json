  "abstract": "\u2014This article investigates the beam training de- sign problems for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where single-waveguide-single-user (SWSU), single-waveguide-multi- user (SWMU) and multi-waveguide-multi-user (MWMU) sce- narios are considered. For SWSU-PASS, we design a scalable codebook, based on which we propose a three-stage beam training (3SBT) scheme. Specifically, 1) firstly, the 3SBT scheme utilizes one activated pinching antenna to obtain a coarse one- dimensional location at the first stage; 2) secondly, it achieves further phase matching with an increased number of activated antennas at the second stage; 3) finally, it realizes precise beam alignment through an exhaustive search at the third stage. For SWMU-PASS, based on the scalable codebook design, we propose an improved 3SBT scheme to support non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission. For MWMU-PASS, we first present a generalized expression of the received signal based on the partially-connected hybrid beamforming structure. Furthermore, we introduce an increased-dimensional scalable codebook design, based on which an increased-dimensional 3SBT scheme is proposed. Numerical results reveal that: i) the proposed beam training scheme can significantly reduce the training over- head compared to the two-dimensional exhaustive search, while maintaining reasonable rate performance; ii) compared to fixed- location pinching antennas and conventional array antennas, the proposed dynamic pinching antennas yield better flexibility and improved performance.

INTRODUCTION To support the higher frequencies and larger bandwidths required by the sixth generation mobile communications (6G), one of the primary focuses in 6G research is the development of novel antenna technologies, featured by their smaller vol- umes, larger scales, and increased flexibility and reconfigura- bility [1]. These advancements are crucial for achieving ultra- high transmission data rates and meeting stringent demands of future communication systems. Currently, the research on 6G novel antenna technologies encompasses various areas, includ- ing but not limited to millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) antennas, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) [2], [3], fluid antennas [4], and movable antennas [5]. Each of these technologies presents unique opportunities and challenges for the evolution of 6G. For instance, while RIS-aided systems Suyu Lv is with School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China (e-mail: lv- suyu@bjut.edu.cn). Yuanwei Liu is with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineer- ing, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, 999077, Hong Kong (e-mail: yuanwei@hku.hk).

Fluid antennas exhibit high flexibility, enabling rapid response to environmental changes, yet they face issues of insufficient robustness, and incapable to combat large-scale pathloss [6]. To tackle these issues, a novel flexible-antenna technology, termed the pinching antenna, has been proposed. This tech- nology was first developed by DOCOMO in 2022 [7], and has recently begun to gain attention from the academics [8], [9]. The concept of pinching antennas involves the activation of small dielectric particles, such as plastic pinches, on a dielectric waveguide, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The pinching antenna offers several compelling advantages that make it an attractive solution for future wireless communication systems. Firstly, it can be deployed along an arbitrarily long waveg- uide, allowing for large-scale adjustment of the locations of activated antennas [10]. This capability enables the antennas to be situated very close to their target receivers, thereby establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links in the near-field communication (NFC) region. Secondly, it yields remarkable antenna reconfiguration. The scale of the pinching-antenna systems (PASS) can be easily adjusted by either activating more pinching antennas or deactivating existing ones on the waveguide, which realizes a dynamic and reconfigurable antenna system. Furthermore, multiple antennas can also be flexibly deployed on one or multiple waveguides, which paves a new way for the implementation of multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) technology. Lastly, pinching antennas are characterized by their extremely low costs, making PASS a highly cost-effective solution. Despite these advantages of PASS, the acquisition of CSI for PASS faces unique challenges compared to conventional fixed-location antennas. On the one hand, the location of a pinching antenna needs to be dynamically changed in order to be tailored to its serving user\u2019s location, which leads to dynamic variations in the channel environment. On the other hand, due to the unpredictability of the locations of the users and their pinching antennas, it is difficult to leverage historical data to establish an accurate channel prediction model [11]. We note that the locations of the activated antennas are closely related to the beam direction, which in turn affects the overall system performance. A crucial issue to be addressed is how to obtain users\u2019 CSI and dynamically adjust the antenna location, which is key to optimize the direction of the transmitted beam accordingly. This motivates us to explore near-field beam training solutions. Instead of the simplified plenary wave model, the more accurate spherical arXiv:2502.05921v1 [eess.SP] 9 Feb 2025"
