  "abstract": "Representation learning plays a central role in structuring internal embeddings to capture the statistical properties of language, in\ufb02uencing the coherence and contextual consistency of generated text. Statistical Coherence Alignment is in- troduced as a method to enforce structured token representations through tensor \ufb01eld convergence, guiding embeddings to re\ufb02ect statistical dependencies inherent in linguistic data. A mathematical framework is established to quantify coherence alignment, integrating a loss function that optimizes representational consistency across training iterations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that applying coher- ence constraints improves perplexity, enhances classi\ufb01cation accuracy, and re\ufb01nes rare word embeddings, contributing to a more stable representation space. Com- parative analyses with baseline models reveal that the proposed method fosters a more interpretable internal structure, ensuring that embeddings retain contextual dependencies while mitigating representation collapse. The impact on coherence score distributions suggests that the alignment mechanism strengthens semantic integrity across diverse linguistic constructs, leading to a more balanced organi- zation of learned embeddings. Computational assessments indicate that while the method introduces additional memory and training costs, the structured optimiza- tion process justi\ufb01es the trade-offs in applications requiring heightened contextual \ufb01delity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of coherence alignment in optimizing token representations, providing insights into how statistical depen- dencies can be leveraged to improve language model training. 1 Introduction In recent years, the \ufb01eld of natural language processing has witnessed signi\ufb01cant advancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have demon- strated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, thereby facilitating a wide array of applications across various domains. Central to the ef\ufb01cacy of LLMs is the concept of representation learning, which involves the automatic discovery of meaningful representations from raw data. This process enables models to capture intricate patterns and structures inherent in language, thus enhancing their performance on diverse linguistic tasks. Traditional approaches to representation learning in LLMs have predominantly relied on methods such as masked language modeling and autoregressive modeling. Masked language modeling in- volves predicting missing words in a sentence, thereby encouraging the model to develop a deep understanding of context. Autoregressive modeling, on the other hand, focuses on predicting the next word in a sequence, which aids in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. While these methods have proven effective, they are not without limitations. For instance, masked lan- Preprint. Under review."
