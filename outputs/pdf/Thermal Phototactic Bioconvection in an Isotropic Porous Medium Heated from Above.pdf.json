This study investigates thermal phototactic bioconvection in an isotropic porous medium using the Darcy- Brinkman model. The top boundary of the medium is exposed to normal collimated light and subjected to heating. A linear analysis of bio-thermal convection is performed using a fourth-order accurate \ufb01nite differ- ence scheme, employing Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich iterations for both rigid-free and rigid-rigid boundary conditions. The effects of the Lewis number, Darcy number, and thermal Rayleigh number on bioconvective processes are examined and presented graphically. The \ufb01ndings reveal that increasing the thermal Rayleigh number stabilizes the suspension, whereas a higher Lewis number enhances instability. I. INTRODUCTION Bioconvection is a \ufb02uid dynamics phenomenon driven by the collective motion of self-propelled microorganisms that are slightly denser than their surrounding \ufb02uid. This process plays a crucial role in various biological and industrial appli- cations [1\u20135]. Motile microorganisms, such as algae and bac- teria, generate density variations as they respond to external stimuli, a behavior known as taxis, leading to convective in- stability. Key examples of taxis include phototaxis, gravitaxis, gyrotaxis, chemotaxis, and thermotaxis. Understanding bio- convection is particularly relevant in environmental science, biotechnology, and engineering, where it in\ufb02uences nutrient transport, bioreactor ef\ufb01ciency, and microbial ecology. Early research primarily focused on suspensions under isothermal conditions. However, many microorganisms, par- ticularly thermophiles inhabiting hot springs, thrive in en- vironments with signi\ufb01cant temperature variations [6\u20138]. Among the various types of taxis in\ufb02uencing microbial move- ment, phototaxis (response to light) and thermotaxis (re- sponse to temperature gradients) play a crucial role in shap- ing bioconvective patterns [9]. While substantial research has been dedicated to phototactic and gravitactic bioconvection in non-porous media, thermal bioconvection in porous me- dia saturated with algal suspensions remains relatively under- explored. The presence of a porous matrix introduces addi- tional complexities, such as \ufb02ow resistance and modi\ufb01ed con- vective dynamics, making it a critical area of study for both natural ecosystems and industrial \ufb02uid systems. The formation and characteristics of bioconvection patterns in\ufb02uenced by phototaxis depend on various environmental light conditions, including direct and oblique collimated so- lar irradiation [10\u201316]. High-intensity light can either disrupt established patterns or inhibit their development [12, 13, 17]. Variations in illumination levels contribute to changes in the spatial structure and size of these patterns. These alterations can be attributed to speci\ufb01c mechanisms. Photosynthetic mi- croorganisms exhibit directional movement in response to light intensity. When the intensity G remains below a criti- cal threshold Gc, they exhibit positive phototaxis, migrating toward brighter regions. However, when G surpasses Gc, they \u2217Corresponding author: E-mail: shubh.iiitj@gmail.com FIG. 1.

This behavior results in the accumulation of microorganisms in regions where G = Gc, forming structured bioconvective patterns (see Fig. 1) [18]. Additionally, the process of light absorption signi\ufb01cantly in- \ufb02uences pattern formation by affecting the spatial distribution of microorganisms within the suspension [19, 20]. Over the years, signi\ufb01cant progress has been made in un- derstanding the mechanisms of bioconvection. Early research primarily focused on gravitactic microorganisms, where the swimming behavior of dense motile microbes was analyzed to determine the instability conditions that lead to convec- tive \ufb02ow [17]. Later, studies on phototactic bioconvection emerged, emphasizing the interactions between microbial re- sponses to light intensity, absorption effects, and microorgan- ism concentration [16]. Ghorai and Hill [21] extended this research by developing two-dimensional phototactic biocon- vection models, emphasizing the role of shading effects. Fur- ther studies by Ghorai et al. [19] investigated phototactic bio- convection in isotropically scattering algal suspensions, while Panda and Singh [22] analyzed its onset in a two-dimensional system with free side walls. The scattering properties of algae, in\ufb02uenced by their shape and size, affect light propagation. Early studies suggested that algae predominantly scatter light"
