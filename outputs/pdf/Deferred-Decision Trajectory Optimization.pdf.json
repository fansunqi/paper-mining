  "abstract": "We present DDTO\u2014deferred-decision trajectory optimization\u2014a framework for trajectory generation with re- silience to unmodeled uncertainties and contingencies. The key idea is to ensure that a collection of candidate targets is reachable for as long as possible while satisfying constraints, which provides time to quantify the uncertainties. We propose optimization-based constrained reachability formulations and construct equivalent cardinality minimization problems, which then inform the design of computationally tractable and efficient solution methods that leverage state-of-the-art convex solvers and sequential convex programming (SCP) algorithms. The goal of establishing the equivalence between constrained reachability and cardinality minimization is to provide theoretically-sound underpinnings for the proposed solution methods. We demonstrate the solution methods on real-world optimal control applications encountered in quadrotor motion planning. 1 Introduction The reference signals generated by the feedforward block of a control system often solve constrained optimal con- trol problems [1]. It is desirable to have the system re- sponse tightly track the reference signals in closed-loop with a feedback controller so that the constraint satisfac- tion and performance requirements guaranteed by the reference signal continue to hold. However, for satisfac- tory performance of the closed-loop system, uncertain- ties need to be accounted for: both within feedforward and feedback blocks. Depending on the nature of the uncertainties, techniques from robust and stochastic con- trol can be utilized. The former deals with uncertainties which are known to belong to a certain class or a set, while the latter handles uncertainties that are known to possess a probability distribution [2]. However, in many real-world circumstances (e.g., search and rescue post-natural disaster and planetary landing on unknown terrain), it is not possible to quantify or model all sources of uncertainties and contingencies in the operational en- vironment a priori. So, how do we reduce the likelihood of mission fail- ure or off-nominal performance in such cases?

One approach to staying immune to unmodeled uncertainties and contingencies (i.e., \u201cun- known\u201d unknowns) is considering multiple candidate targets, instead of a single target. We focus our attention on the feedforward block and ask the question: how can the reference signal help with the identification of the best target? In the real-world setting, it is reasonable to assume that the vehicle can acquire new actionable information as it moves towards the candidate targets. So, deferring the decision to commit to/select a target provides time to learn (acquire more information) about the uncertainties. In a closed-loop system, for exam- ple, the perception and measurement updates provide new information. Ensuring that the candidate targets are reachable for as long as possible enables the vehi- cle to acquire new information for as long as possible, which then informs the best choice of target, where \u201cbest\u201d could mean safest or cost-efficient. The example of soft landing of a spacecraft on an un- known planetary terrain highlights the usefulness of deferring decision. The goal is to land a spacecraft at one of landing sites from a collection of candidates (see Figure 1). We only possess coarse-grained information about the terrain and need to wait until the spacecraft nears the terrain to gather high-resolution information. It is straightforward to imagine a situation where the spacecraft chooses a landing site prematurely, but deter- mines that it is not viable after getting too close, at which point recovery or divert might be impossible. Therefore, deferring decision is useful in this scenario for keeping a collection of landing sites reachable for a period of time while high-resolution terrain information is gathered to determine which candidate landing sites are viable [3].
