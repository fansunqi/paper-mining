  "abstract": "We present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding (TB) and potential models to efficiently calculate the phonon-assisted optical absorption in semiconduc- tors with ab initio accuracy. Our strategy enables efficient sampling of atomic configurations through molecular dynamics and rapid computation of electronic structure and optical properties from the TB models. We demonstrate its efficacy by calculating the temperature-dependent optical absorp- tion spectra and band gap renormalization of Si and GaAs due to electron-phonon coupling over a temperature range of 100-400 K. Our results show excellent agreement with experimental data, capturing both indirect and direct absorption processes, including subtle features like the Urbach tail. This approach offers a powerful tool for studying complex materials with high accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for high-throughput screening of optoelectronic materials. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, facilitat- ing the development of predictive models across various scales. These models, which range from atomic interac- tion potentials [1\u201316] to electronic Hamiltonians in either tight-binding [17\u201322] or Kohn-Sham formalism [23\u201330], have significantly enhanced efficiency of material simu- lations while maintaining ab initio level accuracy. This, in turn, is reflected in machine learning interatomic po- tentials (MLIPs) showing remarkable success for a wide range of applications, including catalytic processes [31], battery optimization [32], alloy design [33], and protein folding [34], etc. By accurately capturing atomic vibra- tions, MLIPs have been able to closely replicate exper- imental spectroscopic data, particularly in Raman and infrared spectra [35\u201338]. However, unlike the diverse and successful practical applications in ML potentials models, it is surprising to see that despite significant progress in the methodological development of ML electronic Hamil- tonians models [17\u201330], attention has not been paid much to their utility in practical applications, particularly for cases involving coupling between electronic and ionic de- grees of freedom. To overcome this considerable gap, by focusing on phonon-assisted optical absorption, we demonstrate the potential of ML-based Hamiltonian models in simulat- ing complex electronic processes. Such an absorption process fundamentally involves the coupling between the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom. It becomes par- ticularly relevant in indirect bandgap materials, where both electron-phonon and electron-photon interactions are required for momentum conservation. These inter- actions lead to bandgap renormalization, broadening of \u2217guqq@ustc.edu.cn absorption and emission line shapes, and enable indirect optical transitions. In this direction, the theory of phonon-assisted in- direct optical transitions, developed by Hall, Bardeen, and Blatt [39], provides foundational insights but does not account for temperature-dependent band struc- tures. Phonon-induced renormalization of band gaps and band structures have been studied within density func- tional theory (DFT)[40\u201342], based on the Allen-Heine theory[43]. M. Zacharias et al. [44, 45] demonstrated that the quasiclassical Williams-Lax theory [46, 47] of- fers a unified framework for calculating optical absorp- tion spectra, including both phonon-assisted transitions and band structures renormalization and their implemen- tation relies on stochastic sampling of phonon normal modes. However, this approach requires large supercells to accommodate the sampling of phonon normal modes, which can be computationally intensive for ab initio cal- culations, especially for complex systems or when using high-accuracy exchange-correlation functionals. More- over, these calculations are based on harmonic approx- imations, which may not fully capture anharmonic ef- fects appearing at finite temperature. Such effects re- sults in strong renormalization of phonon spectra re- sulting in drastic moderation of properties arising from electron-phonon coupling like conventional superconduc- tivity [48, 49], ferroelectricity [50] and thermoelectric- ity [51]. This limits the applicability of ab initio based finite temperature phonon-assisted optical spectra calcu- lations at large-scale or in high-throughput studies. The above limitations fall squarely in the realm of ML models, which provide highly efficient simulations. In this work, we address these limitations by present- ing a framework that integrates deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD)[6] and deep learning tight-binding (DeePTB)[18] models to efficiently and efficiently cal- culate phonon-assisted optical absorption, based on the arXiv:2502.00798v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 2 Feb 2025"
