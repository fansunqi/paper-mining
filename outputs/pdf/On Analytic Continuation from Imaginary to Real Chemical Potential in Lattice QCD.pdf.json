  "abstract": "One is necessar- ily left with the problem of analytically continuing results to real values of \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc35. In the framework of the Bielefeld Parma Collaboration, we have in recent years studied a multi-point Pad\u00e9 de- scription of the net baryon number density computed as a function of imaginary baryon number chemical potential. While our main emphasis has till now been on the determination of Lee-Yang singularities, the method is per se a natural tool to analytically continue results. We report on the status of our projects with this respect, comparing the Pad\u00e9 approach to analytic continuation to another, new strategy, which is an application of the Cauchy integral formula in the sense of an inverse problem.
