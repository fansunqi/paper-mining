  "title": "Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC Local Trajectory Planning Metho.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014 The widespread application of autonomous driv- ing technology has significantly advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during au- tonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature- integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference ve- locity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curva- ture of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, im- proving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/CiMPCC. I. INTRODUCTION Autonomous racing requires vehicles to complete laps as fast as possible without colliding with obstacles. This mission is challenging yet crucial as it pushes the boundaries of autonomous vehicle capabilities. Achieving this mission poses significant challenges to the trajectory planning method for autonomous racing [1]. The trajectory planning methods for autonomous racing can be divided into offline global [2], [3] and online local [4]\u2013[6] planning methods. The offline global trajectory planning methods can synthesize global racetrack information to generate globally optimal trajectories. However, it is challenging to account for changes in real-time vehicle states, which can pose risks to vehicle motion [7]. The online local trajectory planning methods are used to tackle this problem. It can respond excellently to changing vehicle states. The model predictive contouring control (MPCC) [8] is one of the classic methods. However, the limited information obtained makes it easy to fall into the local optimal solution [6]. Specifically, the traditional MPCC * This work was supported by the Ningbo Key research and development Plan (No.2023Z116). \u2020 Corresponding author. 1 Zhouheng Li, Lei Xie, Cheng Hu, and Hongye Su are with the State Key Laboratory of Industrial, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. { zh.li@zju.edu.cn;leix@iipc.zju.edu.cn; 22032081@zju.edu.cn; hysu@iipc.zju.edu.cn} Existing MPCC Framework contouring and lagging error projected velocity maximization constraints control law smoothness Proposed Curvature-Integrated MPCC Framework contouring and lagging error projected velocity maximization constraints control law smoothness contouring and lagging error projected velocity maximization constraints control law smoothness Velocity mapping Velocity mapping Fig. 1.

We tackle this challenge by integrating the curvature of the racetrack centerline into the optimization problem, optimiz- ing the velocity profile within the planned local trajectory. This proposed method decreases the vehicle velocity in sharp curvature sections of the racetrack to keep the vehicle close to the centerline while maintaining higher velocity in sections with smaller curvature, thereby improving overall lap time. In this paper, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) trajectory planning method for autonomous rac- ing, which tackles racetracks with significant curvature changes and performs excellent lap time. This paper has the following innovations and contributions: 1) A practical method for integrating the curvature into optimization problems: the curvature of the racetrack centerline is smoothed and normalized to integrate into the optimization problem of the CiMPCC method. It is utilized to optimize the velocity of the planned local trajectory, particularly in sharp and changing curvature sections of the racetrack, leading to reduced lap time; 2) A novel mapping method between curvature and velocity: the designed mapping function maps the normalized curvature of the racetrack centerline to reference velocity. It effectively optimizes the velocity arXiv:2502.03695v1 [cs.RO] 6 Feb 2025"
