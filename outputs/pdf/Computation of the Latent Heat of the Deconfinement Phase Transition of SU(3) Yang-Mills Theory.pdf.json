  "abstract": "By measuring the entropy density \ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50)/\ud835\udc473 \ud835\udc50on both sides of the phase transition at the critical temperature\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50, we can retrieve the latent heat \u210e. Additionally, we compute \u210efrom the discontinuity in the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor. Simulations are performed at five different values of the lattice spacing, allowing us to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The two observables produce compatible results, giving the combined estimate \u210e= 1.175(10) in the continuum limit, achieving a precision of about 1%. Moreover, we determine the critical temperature in physical units with permille accuracy, yielding \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 \u221a\ud835\udc610 = 0.24915(29). These results allow us to connect the confined and the deconfined phases with precision, and we present an improved computation of the Equation of State across the phase transition for temperatures between 0 and 3.4\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50.
