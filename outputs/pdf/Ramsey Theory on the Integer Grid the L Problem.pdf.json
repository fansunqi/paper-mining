  "abstract": "In an [n] \u00d7 [n] integer grid, a monochromatic L is any set of points {(i, j), (i, j + t), (i + t, j + t)} for some positive integer t, where 1 \u2264i, j, i + t, j + t \u2264n. In this paper, we investigate the upper bound for the smallest integer n such that a 3-colored n \u00d7 n grid is guaranteed to contain a monochromatic L. We use various methods, such as counting intervals on the main diagonal and using Golomb rulers, to improve the upper bound. This bound originally sat at 2593, and we improve it \ufb01rst to 1803, then to 1573, then to 772, and \ufb01nally to 493. In the latter part of this paper, we discuss the lower bound and our attempts to improve it using SAT solvers. 1. Introduction to the Problem The problem we deal with in this paper is a Ramsey-type problem on the integer grid. Namely, we deal with the following corollary of the Gallai-Witt theorem. Theorem 1 ([10]). For all positive integers k, there exists a positive integer n such that, for all k-colorings of [n]\u00d7[n], there is a monochromatic L. That is, there exist positive integers x, y, and d such that: 1. (x, y), (x + d, y), and (x + d, y + d) are all in [n] \u00d7 [n], and"
