Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high- frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely. These findings open up avenues for designing ultra low-power sensing and spintronic technology. Introduction Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials with unique electronic properties, charac- terized by bulk insulating behavior and topologically protected metallic surface states [1, 2]. These surface states exhibit Dirac-cone-like energy dispersion and spin- momentum locking [3, 4], rendering them robust against backscattering in the absence of spin-flip processes [5]. This intriguing characteristic makes TIs highly promis- ing for applications in spintronics and dissipationless elec- tronics [6]. While three-dimensional TIs were initially proposed in time-reversal invariant systems, in magnetic TIs an ex- change gap arises in the Dirac band dispersion (as shown schematically in Fig. 1) due to the presence of magneti- zation or, equivalently, a broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) [7]. In recent years, magnetic TIs and unique quantum states within these materials, such as quan- tum anomalous Hall states [8], axion insulators [9], and high Chern number phases [10], have garnered significant attention due to their diverse fundamental properties, applicable in next-generation spintronics [7], and quan- tum computing [11, 12]. The giant spin-torque efficiency of magnetic TIs offers particular promise for developing energy-efficient spintronic devices. Extensive research ef- forts, both theoretical and experimental, have therefore been dedicated to exploring the fundamentals as well as potential applications of magnetic TIs [13\u201315]. One common approach to realizing magnetic TIs in- volves the incorporation of magnetic dopants, such as in Bi2Te3 doped with Cr or V [7]. This method of- fers several advantages over alternative realizations of magnetic TIs, including the application of external mag- netic fields [7], proximity-induced magnetism from mag- netic insulators [16], or the intrinsic magnetic TIs such as MnBi2Te4 [17]. It enables control over the direction and magnitude of magnetization induced by magnetic im- purities [18, 19], while the fabrication techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy allow for tailored distribu- tion of these impurities, locally or globally [7]. However, the introduction of magnetic dopants inevitably leads to disorder and impurity scattering during electronic trans- port. This magnetic disorder directly impacts the spin of electrons and, due to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, indirectly influences their momentum. Con- sequently, charge-current dissipation and backscattering are enhanced, limiting the appeal of these materials for practical applications. To circumvent these limitations of magnetic TIs and foster their application in next-generation spintronic de- vices, it is crucial to identify strategies for realizing dissipationless states without backscattering. In this Letter, we reveal the possibility to control the elec- tronic and transport properties of magnetic TIs by apply- ing high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). More FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of backscattering in pristine and magnetic TIs. In pristine TIs, helical surface states are protected from backscattering due to TRS. In magnetic TIs, TRS is broken, leading to backscattering and destruction of helical surface states. The top panel illustrates the illumina- tion with high-frequency LPL, as used in this work, incident perpendicular to the TI surface, with a polarization angle \u03b8 relative to x-axis. arXiv:2502.10164v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 14 Feb 2025"
