  "title": "A New Method for Structural Diagnostics with Muon Tomography and Deep Learning.pdf",
  "abstract": "This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of the muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simula- tions, we demonstrate the feasibility of the reconstruction of 1 cm\u2013thick iron tubes inside 30 cm\u2013deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results in a dramatic improvement of the image quality and a significant reduction of the data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics. \u2217lorenzo.pezzotti@cern.ch 1 arXiv:2502.03339v1 [hep-ex] 5 Feb 2025"
