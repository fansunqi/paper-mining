  "abstract": "News recommendation systems aim to serve users with relevant content. One key application is homepage personalization, where articles shown in the news homepages are tailored to individual users. While homepage personalization has potential for higher engagement, there are qualitative aspects impacting recommenda- tion such as content type, editorial stance, and geographic focus. Local newspapers, in particular, aim to engage readers from spe- cific cities or regions by balancing local, national, and international coverage. Identifying local articles presents a challenge, as implicit locations are often conveyed through references to local slang, no- table figures, sports teams, or landmarks rather than being explicitly mentioned. Traditional approaches, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), extract entities from text, while Knowledge Graphs help infer lo- cations that may not be explicitly stated. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new possibilities, raising questions about their ability to internalize relational knowledge and potentially replace traditional methods. However, these ad- vancements also raise concerns regarding hallucinations, outdated data and a lack of explainability. This paper presents a novel approach to classifying local articles using LLMs within Taboola\u2019s \"Homepage For You\" personalization algorithm. We compared traditional classification techniques with LLM-based models, evaluating both standalone LLMs and those augmented with Knowledge Graph data. Our analysis revealed three key insights: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models\u2019 ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration. Offline evaluations showed that LLMs excel in implicit local classification tasks compared to traditional methods, while online A/B tests showed an increase in user engagement metrics.

At full scale, this deployment resulted in an average uplift of 27% in local articles served, maintaining newspapers\u2019 brand iden- tity. By leveraging state-of-the-art auxiliary models, our framework enables real-time indexing of article location data, making it read- ily available for training and significantly enhancing homepage personalization.

One of their main challenges is maximizing reader engagement with content. News have to be fresh, and to present what is currently popular or need-to-know by the user. Traditional websites rely on editors to manually curate and po- sition content, resulting in a static experience that is identical for all users. Today, recommender systems can serve different content to each user while adhering to editorial guidelines. This has led to a growing trend of personalized homepages that deliver tailored content to every user. Homepage personalization enables news websites to present content which is correlated with each reader\u2019s interests, enhancing their experience and increasing overall engagement [11, 28]. Most homepages typically follow a consistent structure for easy naviga- tion. The header contains the site logo, brand name, and navigation menu.
