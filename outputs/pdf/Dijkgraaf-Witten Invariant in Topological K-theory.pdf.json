  "abstract": "Given a finite group G, we define a new invariant of odd-dimensional oriented closed manifolds and call it the KDW invariant. This invariant is a Dijkgraaf\u2013Witten invariant in terms of K-theory. In this paper, we compute the invariant of the Brieskorn homology spheres with G = PSL2(Fp). We should remark that, in this computational result, the fundamental groups of the Brieskorn homology spheres and PSL2(Fp) are not nilpotent. Keywords Dijkgraaf\u2013Witten invariant, K-theory, Representation theory Subject Code 55N15 1 Introduction For a finite group G, the Dijkgraaf\u2013Witten (DW) invariant DWG is a topological invari- ant of oriented closed 3-manifolds defined by Dijkgraaf and Witten [7]. Roughly speaking, the DW invariant, DWG(M), of an oriented closed 3-manifold M is the formal sum of push- forwards \u03c6\u2217([M]) \u2208H3(BG; Z), where \u03c6 ranges over all the homomorphisms \u03c01(M) \u2192G. Here, [M] \u2208H3(M, Z) is an orientation class of M and BG is a classifying space of G. In addition, Dijkgraaf and Witten have constructed a toy model-like (2+1)-TQFT derived from the DW invariant. In other words, providing computational examples of the DW invariant leads to a deeper understanding of the TQFT. Nevertheless, in the previous studies, there are few examples of computing the DW invariant unless G is abelian or nilpotent. As a generalization, we can define orientation classes of any generalized homology as analogies of the orientation class [M] of ordinary homology (see, e.g., [22]). In particular, for the K-homology K\u2217, it is known that a spinc structure of an odd-dimensional oriented closed manifold M defines an orientation class [M]K of M in K\u2217(M) (see [12]). Thus, thanks to these orientation classes, it is possible to extend the definition of TQFTs based on ordinary homology to generalized homologies under certain assumptions. For TQFTs based on generalized homologies, see, e.g., [10]. This paper further studies the DW invariant in terms of K-theory; this form of the DW invariant is called the KDW invariant and denoted by KDWG(M) \u2208Z[K1(BG)] (Definition \u2217Department of Mathematics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8551, JAPAN e-mail:yanagida.k.ab@m.titech.ac.jp 1 arXiv:2502.11548v1 [math.GT] 17 Feb 2025"
