Carl Friedrich Gauss 3, 08860 Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain Phonons are essential (quasi)particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be viewed as the Goldstone modes arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we present a comprehensive\u2014in the absence of Holstein phonons\u2014theory of the quantum geometric contributions to the phonon spectra of crystals. Using graphene as a case study, we separate the dynamical matrix into several terms that depend differently on the electron energy and wavefunction, and demonstrate that the quantum geometric effects are crucial in shaping the phonon spectra of the material. Neglecting them leads to a gap in the acoustic phonon branches, which clearly violates the Goldstone theorem. Introduction.\u2014Every crystal supports elastic waves, which are traveling quanta of vibrational energy [1, 2] that Frenkel dubbed \u201cphonons\u201d in 1932. Phonons are quasiparticles that appear in a wide variety of condensed matter phenomena. Most notably, they serve as the bosonic glue that binds electrons into Cooper pairs in many conventional BCS superconductors [3]. They also play crucial roles in thermal and electrical transport, acting as an intrinsic and unavoidable source of scat- tering for electrons moving through a crystal. Addi- tionally, phonons are important in atomically thin two- dimensional (2D) materials [4]: the authors of Ref. [5] demonstrated that graphene samples encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride can display very large mobil- ities also at room temperature, which are solely lim- ited by scattering of electrons against graphene\u2019s acous- tic phonons [6\u201310]. These are gapless modes near the center of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ)\u2014see black lines labelled by \u201cLA\u201d and \u201cTA\u201d in Fig. 1\u2014and play an im- portant role in limiting plasmon lifetimes [11\u201314] in the same devices. From a theoretical point of view, acoustic phonons can be thought of as the Goldstones associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetry [15\u201318]. The physical properties listed above depend critically on the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) [19, 20]. The coexistence of electrons and phonons in a single host crys- tal has recently prompted various authors to search for topological contributions to phonons that originate mi- croscopically from the EPI (see, for example, Refs. [21] and [22]). After two decades of intense research on ap- plying topology to material science properties [23\u201326], a more general mathematical framework\u2014now universally known as \u201cquantum geometry\u201d\u2014is attracting significant FIG. 1.

The relevant parameters needed to produce these plots have been determined by fitting ab initio density functional theory results.

Note that the dispersion represented by blue crosses violates the Goldstone theorem [15\u201318]. attention in the community [27, 28]. In 1980, Provost and Vallee [29] understood that the usual Hermitian prod- uct on the projective Hilbert space induces a meaningful metric tensor on any manifold of quantum states. This intuition led them to introduce the quantum geometric arXiv:2502.04221v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 6 Feb 2025"
