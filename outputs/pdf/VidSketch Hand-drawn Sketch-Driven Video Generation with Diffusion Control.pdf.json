  "abstract": "With the advancement of generative artificial in- telligence, previous studies have achieved the task of generating aesthetic images from hand-drawn sketches, fulfilling the public\u2019s needs for draw- ing. However, these methods are limited to static images and lack the ability to control video ani- mation generation using hand-drawn sketches. To address this gap, we propose VidSketch, the first method capable of generating high-quality video animations directly from any number of hand- drawn sketches and simple text prompts, bridg- ing the divide between ordinary users and profes- sional artists. Specifically, our method introduces a Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy to auto- matically adjust the guidance strength of sketches during the generation process, accommodating users with varying drawing skills. Furthermore, a TempSpatial Attention mechanism is designed to enhance the spatiotemporal consistency of gen- erated video animations, significantly improving the coherence across frames.

Introduction With the development of generative artificial intelligence, some studies (Koley et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a) have successfully automated image generation from sketches, sig- nificantly lowering the barrier for non-experts to produce high-quality drawings. However, existing methods primar- ily focus on static images, leaving a gap in automatically creating video animations from hand-drawn sketches.

This approach removes barriers, enabling non-experts to create high-quality animations and meet diverse aesthetic needs. Variations in users\u2019 drawing skills make it impractical to use a single sketch control strength for VDMs during in- ference. Abstract sketches need lower control strength to avoid subject distortion and poor text alignment. To address this, we propose the Level-Based Sketch Control Strategy, which dynamically evaluates levels of abstraction in a sketch sequence and adjusts guidance strength during video gener- ation, ensuring VidSketch\u2019s generalizability. Unlike static images, video animations require strong inter- frame consistency to prevent issues such as discontinuity. To solve this, we introduce a TempSpatial Attention mecha- nism, which improves the spatiotemporal consistency and fluidity of the generated video animations. We evaluated the fine-tuned VidSketch model, and results show it aligns well with hand-drawn sketches while ensuring high video quality, aesthetic appeal, style diversity, and spa- tiotemporal consistency. Moreover, it removes professional barriers, meeting ordinary users\u2019 needs for video anima- 1 arXiv:2502.01101v1 [cs.CV] 3 Feb 2025"
