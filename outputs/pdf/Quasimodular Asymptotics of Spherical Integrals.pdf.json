We show that the spherical integral of the Circular Unitary Ensemble con- verges in expectation to Euler\u2019s generating function for integer partitions, and that sub- leading corrections to this high-dimensional limit are quasimodular forms. 1. Introduction Let UN = Aut CN be the unitary group with its normalized Haar measure, dU. In this paper we take a new point of view on the spherical integral (1) KN(q, A, B) = Z eqN Tr AUBU\u2217dU of Harish-Chandra [24] and Itzykson-Zuber [26] by considering it as an observable of the Circular Unitary Ensemble [33]. More precisely, taking A = AN and B = A\u2217 N with AN Haar-distributed in UN, the determinantal evaluation [24, 26] of (1) becomes (2) KN(q, AN, A\u2217 N) = 1!2! . . . (N \u22121)! (qN)(N 2) det[eqNai\u00afaj] Q i<j |ai \u2212aj|2 with a1, . . . , aN the random eigenvalues of AN. Like the characteristic polynomial of AN, this random entire function of q \u2208C is visibly sensitive to eigenvalue repulsion. We show here that for |q| < e\u22121 the expected spherical integral of the CUE converges without normalization to Euler\u2019s generating function for integer partitions: (3) lim N\u2192\u221e ZZ eqN Tr AUA\u2217U\u2217dUdA = \u221e Y n=1 1 1 \u2212qn. Thus for example we have (4) lim N\u2192\u221e ZZ ee\u2212\u03c0N Tr AUA\u2217U\u2217dUdA = 27/8\u03c03/4 e\u03c0/24\u0393( 1 4), where the evaluation of Q\u221e n=1(1 \u2212e\u2212n\u03c0) is due to Ramanujan [1]. In fact, we prove a much more precise result: the principal logarithm LN(q) of the expected spherical integral of AN admits a complete N \u2192\u221easymptotic expansion whose subleading terms are quasimodular forms. This gives a new point of contact between random matrices and number theory. Let \u2225F\u2225\u03b5 denote the maximum modulus of a continuous function F(q) on the closure of D(\u03b5) = {q \u2208C: |q| < \u03b5}, and let D = D(1). 1"
