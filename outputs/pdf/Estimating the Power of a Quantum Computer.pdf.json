  "abstract": "Brandon Rodenburg Quantum Technologies Group, MITRE, 200 Forrestal Rd. Princeton, New Jersey 08540, USA Various benchmarking metrics have been developed to quantify the performance of quantum computing hardware and help eval- uate development. However, it is not al- ways necessary to know the metric values precisely. This is especially true for poten- tial end-users who may not be experts in the underlying technology itself. In this work, we show how to estimate the quantum volu- metric metrics defined in [1] based on system parameters such as qubit number, qubit lay- out/connectivity, and physical error rates. As part of this work, we also include an ini- tial analysis of how the overhead required for quantum error correction in systems be- low the error correction viability threshold affects the metric value of that system. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, but developing rapidly. The center of mass of this field has shifted from being primarily basic research within academic and national labs, to large scale commercial efforts largely funded by venture capi- talists and private industry. In the last few years alone, hundreds of quantum computing startups have appeared in this space. This includes a sig- nificant rise in companies focused on software and applications, rather than hardware development alone [2]. In addition, quantum computing has caught the eye of big business with 74% of large global enterprises having begun adopting quantum computing, with the majority (71%) of these com- panies having quantum computing budgets exceed- ing one million US dollars per year [3].

With this growth comes the re- quirement of clear performance metrics that can be used and understood by both experts and end- users alike. Such metrics allow organizations to bet- ter plan for disruption, engage with the technology, and to more clearly discern hype from opportunity. Volumetric metrics have arisen as a valuable frame- work for meeting these needs [1], and is the basis for the rest of this work. A detailed introduction of quantum volumetric metrics is given in Section 1. In Section 2, we intro- duce the concept of an effective error rate and relate this to the volumetric metrics. How to account for the physical or topological layout and connectivity of qubits in actual devices we address in Section 3. The impact of available gate set and physical er- ror rates on the effective error and thus metrics are detailed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 gives an overview of how the tradeoffs inherent in the use of quantum error correction, including both encod- ing overheads and magic state distillation, can be tuned in order to optimize system performance as measured by our metrics. 1 Quantum Computing Metrics Quantum computing metrics represent quantita- tive figures of merit that are meant to reflect the capabilities of some given platform. An ideal met- ric has a number of ideal features such as: [1] 1. Universal and platform independent 2. Applicable to both near (NISQ) and long term (FT) systems 3. Simple enough to be useful and understand- able to non-experts 1 arXiv:2502.00113v1 [quant-ph] 31 Jan 2025"
