  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of the eclipse properties of the spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1908+2105, using wide-band observations from the uGMRT and Parkes UWL. For the first time, we observed that this pulsar exhibits extended eclipses up to 4 GHz, the highest frequency band of the UWL, making it one of only three MSPs known to have such high-frequency eclipses. This study reveals synchrotron absorption as the primary eclipse mechanism for J1908+2105. We present modeling of synchrotron optical depth with various possible combinations of the parameters to explain the observed eclipsing in this as well as other spider MSPs. Observed eclipses at unusually high frequencies for J1908+2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic field and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the synchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in the literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of eclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher electron column density (> 1017 cm\u22122) in the eclipse medium. Additionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse boundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio emissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this paper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger magnetic fields in the eclipse region.

INTRODUCTION Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binary or- bits having a low-mass non-degenerate or partially non- degenerate companion with an orbital period of less than a day are known as \u201cspider MSPs\u201d (Roberts 2013). De- pending on the mass of the companion (Mc), these spi- der MSPs are further divided into two categories; \u201cblack widow (BW)\u201d (Mc < 0.05 M\u2299) and \u201credback (RB)\u201d(0.1 M\u2299< Mc < 0.9 M\u2299) spiders. As the pulsar and the companion are in very close proximity, in these sys- tems, the highly energetic wind from the pulsar ablates the companion. Material blown from the companion causes an eclipse by obscuring the pulsar\u2019s radio emis- sion. Frequency-dependent eclipsing is reported for a majority of known spider MSPs. Such eclipsing MSP systems can aid in the understanding of properties of the low-mass companions in tight binary orbits, plasma properties of eclipse material, mass flow from the com- panion driven by relativistic pulsar wind, orbital prop- erties in strong gravitational potential, etc. Thompson et al. (1994) reviewed a set of plausible eclipse mech- anisms suggested by several authors. The majority of these works proposed cyclo-synchrotron absorption as a likely eclipse mechanism for low-frequency eclipses and scattering/stimulated Raman scattering as the cause of high-frequency eclipses. Understanding the eclipse mechanism allows us to investigate the subsequent prop- erties of eclipsing materials as well as the interpretation of the intrabinary shock that happens in these systems as a result of stellar wind and relativistic pulsar wind interaction. Polarization properties are closely tied to the local en- vironment of a pulsar, making polarization studies of the eclipse medium in spider MSPs crucial for uncover- ing the mysteries of the eclipse mechanism (Polzin et al. 2019). Spider MSPs are particularly intriguing because tracking the evolution of rotational measure (RM) and polarization position angle (PPA) swings throughout the orbit can provide insights into the dynamic state of the ablated material in the eclipse medium.
