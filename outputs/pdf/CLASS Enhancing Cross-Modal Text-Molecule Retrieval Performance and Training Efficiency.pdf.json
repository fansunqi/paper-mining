  "title": "CLASS Enhancing Cross-Modal Text-Molecule Retrieval Performance and Training Efficiency.pdf",
  "abstract": "Cross-modal text-molecule retrieval task bridges molecule structures and natural language descriptions. Existing methods predominantly focus on aligning text modality and molecule modality, yet they overlook adaptively adjusting the learning states at different training stages and enhancing training efficiency. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a Curriculum Learning-bAsed croSS-modal text-molecule training framework (CLASS), which can be integrated with any backbone to yield promising performance improvement. Specifically, we quantify the sample difficulty considering both text modality and molecule modality, and design a sample scheduler to introduce training samples via an easy-to-difficult paradigm as the training advances, remarkably reducing the scale of training samples at the early stage of training and improving training efficiency. Moreover, we introduce adaptive intensity learning to increase the training intensity as the training progresses, which adaptively controls the learning intensity across all curriculum stages. Experimental results on the ChEBI-20 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method gains superior performance, simultaneously achieving prominent time savings. 1 Introduction In the process of drug development, pharmacolo- gists often need to search for existing molecular structures to design new molecules or study newly discovered compounds. However, with the rapid de- velopment of bioinformatics, the scale of molecular structures currently discovered has become increas- ingly large, making it difficult for pharmacologists to directly and quickly retrieve the required molec- ular structures. As shown in Figure 1, the cross- modal text-molecule retrieval task (Edwards et al., 2021) consists of text-molecule retrieval task and molecule-text retrieval task, aiming to utilize text Figure 1: An overview of cross-modal text-molecule retrieval tasks, involving text-molecule retrieval task and molecule-text retrieval task. The text-molecule re- trieval task refers to retrieving the correct molecule us- ing text as a query, while the molecule-text retrieval task is to retrieve the corresponding text description for the molecule. The red text indicates the ground-truth retrieval result. description to search for relevant molecular struc- tures or retrieve corresponding text information us- ing molecules as queries, enabling pharmacologists to obtain compound information more effectively. Therefore, developing a cross-modal text-molecule retrieval model is of great significance for the study of molecular structures. Early cross-modal text-molecule retrieval work mainly focuses on optimizing text representations and molecule representations, and then calculat- ing text-molecule similarity for retrieval. For example, some studies (Zeng et al., 2022; Ed- wards et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b) adopt pre- trained models for encoding SMILES sequences of molecules(Weininger, 1988) and text sequences. Alternatively, some studies (Su et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a) represent molecules as 2D topolog- ical graphs, and then use cross-modal contrastive learning to align molecule graphs and text descrip- tions within a shared semantic space. The latest work attempts to apply methods such as adversarial learning (Zhao et al., 2024), memory networks (Song et al., 2024), and optimal trans- port (Min et al., 2024) to align text modality and molecule modality. Although these methods sig- 1 arXiv:2502.11633v1 [cs.CL] 17 Feb 2025"
