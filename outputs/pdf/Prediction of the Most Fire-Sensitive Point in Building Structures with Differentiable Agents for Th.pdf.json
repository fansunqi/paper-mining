  "abstract": "\u2014Fire safety is a critical area of research in civil and mechanical engineering, particularly in ensuring the structural stability of buildings during fire events. The Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) in a structure is the location where a fire would cause the greatest impact on structural stability. Accurate predic- tion of the MFSP is vital for streamlining structural assessments and optimizing the design process. This paper presents a novel framework for MFSP prediction using a neural network-based approach that integrates fire dynamics and finite element analysis through a differentiable agent model. The framework focuses on predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR), a key indicator of structural performance under fire conditions. By leveraging the differentiable agent model, we efficiently generate labeled data for MFSP and directly train a predictor for this critical metric. To achieve this, we generated extensive simulation data encompassing structural and fire scenarios and employed graph neural networks to represent the building structures. Transfer learning was applied to optimize the training process, and an edge update mechanism was introduced to dynamically adjust edge attributes, reflecting property changes under fire conditions. The proposed model was rigorously evaluated on simulation data, demonstrating strong performance in accurately predicting both MIDR and MFSP, thus advancing fire safety analysis for building structures.

INTRODUCTION With the rapid urbanization and increasing complexity of building structures, fire safety has become a critical global issue. Fires pose significant challenges to structural integrity and stability of buildings, making it essential to incorporate fire safety measures during the design phase to enhance resilience and prevent catastrophic failures. The devastating impact of recent wildfires in California highlights the urgency Professor Khalid M. Mosalam is the corresponding author. This paper is currently under review at Computer-Aided Civil and Infras- tructure Engineering. of improving fire risk assessment and mitigation measures in the built environment [3]. A standard fire safety requirement mandates that a building must withstand collapse for at least one hour under fire conditions at any specific point within the structure. Current methods to ensure this involve computational simulations, where fire scenarios are simulated at all potential locations within the building structure. This exhaustive approach is computationally expensive and time-consuming, increasing the cost and duration of structural design. To address this inefficiency, we propose a novel method neural network-based framework to predict the Most Fire- Sensitive Point (MFSP) \u2013the location where fire has the greatest impact on a structure\u2019s stability. By identifying the MFSP, designers need to simulate only a single fire scenario to evaluate structural compliance, significantly reducing com- putational costs and enhancing design efficiency. Training an MFSP predictor using traditional supervised learning is impractical due to the lack of labeled data. Gen- erating such data requires simulating fire dynamics at every possible location within a structure \u2013a process that is both labor-intensive and computationally prohibitive. To overcome this, we introduce an innovative framework comprising two neural network predictors: the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) Predictor and the MFSP Predictor. The workflow begins with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations for a limited set of fire scenarios, which are used to train the MIDR Predictor. This predictor serves as a highly efficient and differentiable agent, simulating structural responses under fire conditions. The differentiable agent is then used in two ways: (1) as an indicator to directly train the MFSP predictor to be an \u201cargmaxer\u201d of the agent, and (2) to generate synthetic data to assist in the training, enabling it to efficiently identify the MFSP without extensive real-world data.
