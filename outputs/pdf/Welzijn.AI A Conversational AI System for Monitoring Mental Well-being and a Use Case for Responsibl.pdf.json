  "abstract": "Objectives. We present Welzijn.AI as new digital solution for monitoring mental well-being in the elderly, as a use case illustrating how recent guide- lines on responsible Artificial Intelligence can inform Welzijn.AI\u2019s Technol- ogy and Value dimensions. Study design. Here Technology concerns the description of an open, well- documented and interpretable envisioned architecture in light of the system\u2019s goals; Value concerns stakeholder evaluations of Welzijn.AI. Stakeholders included, among others, informal/professional caregivers, a developer, pa- tient and physician federations, and the elderly. Brief empirical evaluations comprised a SWOT-analysis, co-creation session, and user evaluation of a proof-of-concept implementation of Welzijn.AI. Main outcome measures. The SWOT analysis summarises stakeholder eval- uations of Welzijn.AI in terms of its Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportu- nities and Threats. The co-creation session ranks technical, environmen- tal and user-related requirements of Welzijn.AI with the Hundred Dollar Method. User evaluation comprises (dis)agreement on statements targeting Welzijn.AI \u2019s main characteristics, and a ranking of desired social character- istics. \u2217Corresponding author at: Health Campus The Hague, Turfmarkt 99, 2511 DP The Hague.
