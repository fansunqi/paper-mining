  "abstract": "\u2014A novel framework, called InterGridNet, is in- troduced, leveraging a shallow RawNet model for geolocation classification of Electric Network Frequency (ENF) signatures in the SP Cup 2016 dataset. During data preparation, recordings are sorted into audio and power groups based on inherent characteristics, further divided into 50 Hz and 60 Hz groups via spectrogram analysis. Residual blocks within the classification model extract frame-level embeddings, aiding decision-making through softmax activation. The topology and the hyperparam- eters of the shallow RawNet are optimized using a Neural Architecture Search. The overall accuracy of InterGridNet in the test recordings is 92%, indicating its effectiveness against the state-of-the-art methods tested in the SP Cup 2016. These findings underscore InterGridNet\u2019s effectiveness in accurately classifying audio recordings from diverse power grids, advancing state-of- the-art geolocation estimation methods.

INTRODUCTION Due to power grid disturbances, the Electric Network Fre- quency (ENF) is a dynamic time series that exhibits fluctua- tions around its nominal frequency of 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz in the United States/Canada. These oscillations result from instantaneous load variations within the power grid, displaying a consistent pattern within interconnected grids. ENF signals become embedded in multimedia recordings captured in proximity to power sources. This distinctive signal can subsequently be extracted [1]\u2013[4] from digital recordings for various applications, such as verification of recording timestamps [5]\u2013[8]. Another application where ENF is also utilized is grid local- ization. Grid localization can be treated as inter-grid [9]\u2013[11] or intra-grid [10] [12] [13] localization. Inter-grid localization focuses on identifying the grid in which a media recording was captured, while intra-grid localization aims to determine the recording\u2019s location within the specific grid precisely. Inter- grid localization is briefly surveyed in Section II. The intra-grid localization is considered more challenging due to the highly subtle distinctions in the ENF signatures encoded within the recorded signals. However, this assumption is challenged by [14], who detail noticeable differences due to varying city power consumptions and the time for load changes to impact different grid segments, a concept further explored in [15]. Additionally, ENF fluctuations can stem from system disruptions like short circuits, power line switching, and generator failures, as noted in [16]. Minor local load changes affect ENF differently than major events like gen- erator disconnections, which impact the entire grid at about 500 miles per second [17]. Given the aforementioned intra- grid characteristics, various methods have been proposed to tackle the problem of intra-grid localization [18] [19] [20]. A novel framework, termed InterGridNet, is introduced for geolocation classification exploiting the ENF. The framework offers a comprehensive approach that includes data prepara- tion and preprocessing techniques using a shallow RawNet [21] for classification. The topology and the hyperparameters of InterGridNet are optimized through Neural Architecture Search (NAS), enhancing its capability to tackle inter-grid localization in audio recordings. It incorporates innovative techniques, including filtering to isolate the relevant ENF signal, using residual layers to extract frame-level embeddings, and employing a softmax activation function in the decision- making process. To our knowledge, this represents a pio- neering advancement spanning from preprocessing techniques to the classification stage, establishing a novel framework in geolocation classification using deep learning methodologies. The Signal Processing (SP) Cup 2016 dataset [22], the only benchmark dataset publicly available, is employed for assess- ing geolocation classification. The key contributions of the paper are as follows: \u2022 A novel framework, coined InterGridNet, is proposed to treat geolocation estimation as a classification problem among nine power grids, employing a shallow RawNet optimized with NAS and leveraging ENF signatures from the benchmark SP Cup 2016 dataset. It should be noted that a shallow RawNet is utilized to reduce the number of parameters and achieve comparable performance with that using a deeper neural network. \u2022 Experimental evaluation, including extensive testing of the SP Cup 2016 dataset, showcases the effectiveness of InterGridNet in geolocation classification across nine distinct power grids, where it is compared with state-of- the-art methods. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec- arXiv:2502.10011v1 [cs.SD] 14 Feb 2025"
