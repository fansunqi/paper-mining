However, detecting chiral character or proximity to these non-trivial states remains a challenge. Resonant Raman scattering can be a powerful tool for detecting chiral fluctuations, as the A2g channel probes excitations with broken time-reversal symmetry and local chiral order. Here, we use exact diagonalization to characterize the resonant A2g channel, alongside two-magnon scattering in B1g and Eg channels, for the Hub- bard model on lattices with increasing levels of geometric spin frustration, where tuning the incident energy near the Mott gap reveals strong chiral spin excitation intensity. Increased spin frustration in the Mott insulator results in an overall softening of the Raman A2g response, indicating a tendency toward low energy chiral- chiral fluctuations in Mott insulators with magnetic frustration and proximity to chiral spin liquid states that can potentially be tuned by external perturbations. I. INTRODUCTION In strongly correlated systems, frustration can give rise to exotic phases such as quantum spin liquids (QSL), a highly entangled state that lacks magnetic ordering even down to zero temperature [1, 2]. A sub-class of QSLs, known as chiral spin liquids (CSL), can host fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with non-Abelian statistics, giving rise to unusual phenom- ena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect [3], and uncon- ventional superconductivity [4, 5]. These states, which break both parity and time-reversal symmetry, may occur even in systems whose parent Hamiltonians are time-reversal invari- ant (Kalmeyer-Laughlin type). For example, theoretical and numerical studies suggest that such CSLs may be realized in geometrically frustrated Hubbard-type models. [6\u201311]. Experimentally detecting CSLs remains challenging, as there are no direct probes for their fractionalized excitations. However, one can measure the scalar spin chirality (SSC), of- fering an avenue for detecting unusual spin textures and time- reversal symmetry breaking fluctuations in frustrated mag- nets. For instance, a non-vanishing SSC in a spin liquid phase can be a useful indicator to determine whether or not a QSL is chiral. In magnetically ordered ground states from SU(2) symmetric systems, signatures of low lying excited states with chiral character can also serve as an indication that a CSL state may lie in close proximity of the ground state. Such states could potentially be stabilized with external perturba- tions. Nevertheless, detecting SSC both experimentally and theoretically have been less explored as a tool for identifying chiral character in putative QSL states. To date, several experimental techniques for detecting SSC in magnetic systems have been proposed. Shastry and \u2217tpd@stanford.edu Shraiman first pointed out that fluctuations of the SSC op- erator couple to the A2g channel in Raman scattering on a square lattice geometry [12, 13]. Resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) in the pre-edge region, with a dipole excitation of a core electron to an off-site valence orbital, has also been pro- posed as a means to measure SSC [14]; however, the use of high-energy x-rays limits the experimental resolution. Neu- tron scattering also may be able to detect SSC if the chiral spin fluctuations couple to Sz fluctuations [15]. Even with these proposals, Raman spectroscopy remains the only realized experimental technique that directly de- tects chiral spin fluctuations. As an optical probe, Ra- man scattering also allows for smaller sample sizes, mak- ing it easily accessible for single-crystal and thin-film exper- iments [16]. Although limited to providing information for very small momentum transfer, Raman scattering serves as a well-established technique for analyzing dynamical proper- ties by selectively utilizing photon polarization to project out the symmetry group of excited states. Measurements of the A2g channel have been made in insulating cuprates [17\u201319], a kagome spin liquid candidate [20], and a heavy fermion su- perconductor [21]. In this paper, we study the Raman scattering cross-section of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. We calculate the resonant Raman cross-section directly by us- ing exact diagonalization (ED) and perturbation theory for the light-matter interaction (Fermi\u2019s Golden Rule) [22]. Specifi- cally, we focus on Raman scattering in the A2g channel, which probes excited states that break time-reversal symmetry. The dynamical properties of the Hubbard model are modified by tuning the frustration with different lattice geometries, with increasing spin frustration from the square and honeycomb lattices to the triangular and kagome lattices. Frustration is also introduced by decreasing the strength of Coulomb inter- action strength in the Hubbard model, rather than relying ex- clusively on a down-folded, spin-only Heisenberg picture. arXiv:2502.07108v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 10 Feb 2025"
