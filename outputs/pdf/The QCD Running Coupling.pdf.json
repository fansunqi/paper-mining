  "abstract": "We describe the coupling of the strong force. Denoted as \u03b1s, it sets the strength of that force, just as G or \u03b1 specify the strength of the gravity and electromagnetism. Its value depends on the scale at which phenomena are observed. In this chapter, we will explain the nature of the coupling, the quantum origin of its scale dependence, and the crucial consequences this entails for quantum chromodynamics, the gauge theory for the strong force. We describe the theories for the calculation of \u03b1s, using the perturbative method at high-momentum scales (equivalently, short-distance scales) and nonperturbative approaches at low-momentum scales (equivalently, long-distance scales). We also present the experimental determinations of \u03b1s at both short and long distance scales.
