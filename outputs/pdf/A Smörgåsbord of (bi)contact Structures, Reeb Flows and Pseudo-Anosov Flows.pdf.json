This note is meant as an invitation to the study of certain families of contact structures, centering around the following question: \u201cHow much can one relate the dynamics of two distinct Reeb flows of the same contact structure?\u201d We gather some results as well as state many more questions and conjectures around that theme. 1. Introduction A given (coorientable) contact structure \u03be on a 3-manifold M admits many Reeb flows. From a dynamical point of view, different Reeb flows of the same contact structure may, a priori, behave dif- ferently. However, in some cases, dynamical similarities have started to appear. There are for instance many examples of contact structures for which every Reeb flows has positive topological entropy (see, e.g., [Alv16, CDHR24, CDR23, FHV21]). Positivity of topological entropy is not a strong dynamical relationship between the Reeb flows, as it only implies that each flow exhibits some type of hyperbolic behavior. However, several of these results give more, as they in fact show some correspondence between the conjugacy classes of loops that admit a periodic Reeb orbit. In some cases, one can in fact hope for a very strong dynamical relationship. In [BM24], J. Bowden, K. Mann, and I proved the following result: Theorem 1.1 ([BM24]). Let R1, R2 be two Anosov Reeb flows of two contact structures \u03be1, \u03be2. Then the Anosov flows R1, R2 are orbit equivalent if and only if \u03be1 and \u03be2 are contactomorphic. In this note, I want to invite the reader to think about how much more general such a result could possibly be made. The most general question I would like to ask is Question 1. Given two Reeb flows R1, R2, of the same contact structure \u03be. How \u201crelated\u201d are the dynamics of R1, R2? Here, \u201crelated\u201d could take many different meanings from the strongest (e.g., orbit equivalent, as in the above theorem), to some much weaker form (e.g., both have positive topological entropy, as discussed previously). In this note, I will consider two different notions of what \u201crelated\u201d should mean. The first, and a priori weakest, involves the free homotopy data, defined as follows Definition 1.2. Given a flow \u03d5 on M, its free homotopy data, denoted by P(\u03d5) is the set of free homotopy classes represented by unoriented periodic orbits of \u03d5. That is, P(\u03d5) := {[\u03b1] \u2208[\u03c01(M)] | [\u03b1] or [\u03b1\u22121] is represented by a periodic orbit of \u03d5}, where [\u03b1] denotes the conjugacy class of an element of \u03c01(M). The free homotopy data was shown in [BM24, BFM22] to be a complete invariant for a lot of pseudo- Anosov flows (see Theorem 3.1 below for a precise statement). In my obviously very biased opinion, this result indicates that studying the free homotopy data of more general classes of 3-dimensional flows should be interesting. So, a rephrasing of Question 1 using this notion is: Question 2. Given two Reeb flows R1, R2, of the same contact structure \u03be. Under what conditions on the Reeb flows Ri, do we have that P(R1) = P(R2)? Does there exist a Reeb flow Rmin of \u03be such that for every other Reeb flow R of \u03be, P(Rmin) \u2282P(R) Deep works in contact geometry, that we will review in section 3, actually give some conditions answering Question 2, at least when \u03be is left invariant by some Anosov flow, and this was crucially used in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Note that a recent very interesting work of Jonathan Zung [Zun24] gives conditions for certain flows to share the same free homotopy data using stable Hamiltonian structures, instead of contact ones, and obtains a generalization of Theorem 1.1. Another notion of what \u201crelated\u201d can mean that I would like to advertise, is that of two flows having the same pseudo-Anosov model, in the following sense: 1 arXiv:2502.07716v1 [math.DS] 11 Feb 2025"
