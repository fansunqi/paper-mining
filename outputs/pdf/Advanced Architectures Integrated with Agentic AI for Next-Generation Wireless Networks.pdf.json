  "abstract": "\u2014This paper investigates a range of cutting-edge technologies and architectural innovations aimed at simplifying network operations, reducing operational expenditure (OpEx), and enabling the deployment of new service models. The focus is on (i) Proposing novel, more efficient 6G architectures, with both Control and User planes enabling the seamless expansion of services, while addressing long-term 6G network evolution. (ii) Exploring advanced techniques for constrained artificial intelligence (AI) operations, particularly the design of AI agents for real-time learning, optimizing energy consumption, and the allocation of computational resources. (iii) Identifying technolo- gies and architectures that support the orchestration of back- end services using serverless computing models across multiple domains, particularly for vertical industries. (iv) Introducing optically-based, ultra-high-speed, low-latency network architec- tures, with fast optical switching and real-time control, replacing conventional electronic switching to reduce power consumption by an order of magnitude.

INTRODUCTION The rapid development of telecommunications systems con- tinues to drive the need for novel network architectures that meet the requirements of future technologies, especially in the transition to 6G [10]. Unlike previous generations, 6G is set to revolutionize not only the performance and capacity of networks, but also enable new, intelligent services that support a variety of use cases, from immersive media to autonomous systems [10]. 6G is also a communication and computing inte- grated platform as AI is considered to be its fundamental key enabler. The AI-integrated 6G system will be able to achieve higher level of automation, such as intent-based networking and automatic orchestration and maintenance (OAM). With the current evolution of AI towards large language models (LLMs) This work was partially funded by \u201cERDF A way of making Europe\u201d project under grant PID2021-126431OB-I00 and Spanish Ministry of Econ- omy and Competitiveness (MINECO)\u2014Program UNICO I+D funded by MCIN/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033 (grants TSI-063000-2021-54 and -55) and Generalitat de Catalunya grant 2021 SGR 00770. and Agentic approaches, the OAM can just simply issue intent for the network configuration to the AI agent, which then run the execution-feed-back-adjust-monitoring process along with the network tasks in an automated manner. Although, the Agentic AI is at its peak, the increasing complexity of the methods along with its support towards networks that are more scalable, efficient, and sustainable has not been discussed before. In response to these new challenges, the development of advanced network architectures integrated with Agentic AI should focus on several key aspects, such as, Reducing operational expenditure (OpEx), simplifying network opera- tions, enabling dynamic service orchestration and integrating intelligent and autonomous functions. In this paper, we take a closer look at these architectural innovations and present solutions that go beyond the current limitations of 5G and early 6G frameworks. One of the key innovations of this paper lies in the design of simplified network architectures that separate the control and user planes, allowing operators to deploy and manage services more efficiently through AI Agents while seamlessly integrat- ing new network domains. This approach also addresses the limitations of existing Service-Based Architectures (SBA) and provides a clear path for the long-term evolution of 6G net- works. The increased flexibility of such architectures ensures that devices can operate as dynamic network nodes, enabling uninterrupted roaming across multiple operators and network technologies. In addition to architectural simplification, the in- tegration of AI Agents Artificial Intelligence (AI) into network management [3] opens up new opportunities for optimization, especially in environments with energy constraints. Agentic AI-based networks can make intelligent decisions based on real-time data, but these models must work within strict energy and security constraints to ensure sustainable and secure operations. The concept of constrained AI operations, which is explored in this paper, is crucial for achieving these goals. It focuses on optimising energy consumption and learning in real-time while maintaining security protocols. In addition, the emergence of serverless computing and Function-as-a-Service arXiv:2502.01089v1 [cs.NI] 3 Feb 2025"
