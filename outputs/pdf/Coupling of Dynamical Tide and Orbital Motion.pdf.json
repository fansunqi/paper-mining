  "abstract": "Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale. 1. MOTIVATION The tidal force induces not only the equilibrium tide but also the dynamical tide, e.g., Zahn (1975); Goldreich & Nicholson (1989); Savonije & Witte (2002); Ogilvie & Lin (2004); Wu (2005); Goodman & Lackner (2009); Fuller & Lai (2012), etc. The former is a large-scale and slow deformation under the hydrostatic balance (i.e., pressure due to deformation is comparable to tidal potential), while the latter consists of various waves, e.g., surface gravity wave (f mode) due to gravity with a free surface, internal gravity wave (g mode) due to buoyancy force with stratification, inertial wave (r mode) due to Coriolis force with rotation, etc. Since dynamical tide is essentially waves, it can resonate with orbital motion, i.e., when orbital frequency is close to one of eigenfrequencies of dynamical tide xingwei@bnu.edu.cn arXiv:2502.01302v1 [astro-ph.EP] 3 Feb 2025"
