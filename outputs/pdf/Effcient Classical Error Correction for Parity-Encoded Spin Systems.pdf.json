  "abstract": "Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate, and significant efforts have been dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction between logical spins, its realization requires a spin system with all-to- all connectivity, which poses technical difficulties in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed parity-encoding (PE) architecture, consisting of a larger system of physical spins with only local connectivities between them, to avoid this difficulty in the near future QA device development. They suggested that this architecture not only reduces implementation difficulties and improves scalability but also has intrinsic fault tolerance because logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded into the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses how to correct errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected by a very simple decoding algorithm that can be regarded as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm was shown to perform comparable to that of the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that introducing post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and improves the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. We believe that our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices. I. INTRODUCTION Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are important mathematical problems in many industrial applications, including routing, scheduling, planning, decision-making processes, transportation, and telecommunications. The COPs have been attracting the interest of many researchers. Intensive efforts have been devoted to developing a fast solver for the COPs. Because many COPs are NP-hard, effective approximation methods such as heuristics [1] and meta-heuristics [2] have frequently been used to solve related problems. Some of these methods are inspired by computational models of natural phenomena and are based on probabilistic simulation of the dynamic process in a physical system. They can be performed on digital computers or specially designed physical hardware. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in natural computing, with new nature-inspired computing hardware being proposed and analyzed based on interesting natural systems such as neural networks, molecules, DNA, and quantum computers [3]. There is growing interest in a quantum annealing (QA) device as a fast solver candidate for COP [4]. The COPs can be mapped to search for the ground state of the Hamiltonian of the Ising spin network. The QA device is a physical device designed to search for such ground state at high speed by exploiting quantum phenomena. QA devices based on various architectures have been developed to solve large-scale industrial and social optimization problems in a reasonable amount of time. D-Wave Systems was the first to develop a commercial QA device consisting of superconducting flux qubits [5\u20139]. Another QA device called a coherent Ising machine, has been developed using optical systems [10\u201313]. Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) have been proposed as other candidates for components of a QA device [14\u201323]. To apply QA devices to universal COPs, it is necessary to simulate a fully connected graph model with an Ising spin network. This requirement is technically demanding, especially in implementing QA devices by superconducting and semiconductor devices, as long- range interactions between spins need to be implemented. To circumvent this problem, a network of spins with long-range interactions (hereafter referred to as logical spins) is usually embedded in a larger network of spins with only short-range interactions (hereafter referred to as physical spins). Minor embedding techniques can be used to replace logical spins with long-range interactions with physical spins with short-range interactions between ferromagnetically coupled chains of spins [24, 25]. As an independent idea, W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller (LHZ) proposed a scalable embedding scheme called parity-encoding (PE) architecture [26]. Overhead comes at the cost of these embedding schemes, as the results of successive short-range interactions simulate long-range interactions. On the other hand, LHZ suggested that the PE architecture has a notable feature: intrinsic fault tolerance. This suggestion is also supported by F. Pastawski and J. Preskill (PP)[27]. They pointed out that the PE architecture is interpreted as a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code [28, 29] and showed that if the errors are independent and identically arXiv:2502.07170v1 [quant-ph] 11 Feb 2025"
