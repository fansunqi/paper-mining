  "abstract": "Molybdenum oxide films are attractive for diverse applications due to properties offered by multiple phases and polymorphs, which also makes exclusive synthesis of desired phases a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio pO2 is key to phase selection, the type and extent of preferred orientation and epitaxy. Exclusive formation of non-layered monoclinic MoO2 crystals is supported on both mica and sapphire substrates at 500 \u00b0C within much of the 0.1 \uf0a3 pO2 \uf0a3 0.25 range, outside which the films are amorphous. At 400 \u00b0C, the behavior is qualitatively similar, except for layered orthorhombic MoO3 formation at high pO2 and greater sensitivity of phase selection to pO2 due to the presence of a larger number of other phases. Increasing the pO2 tends to enhance preferred orientation and epitaxy, with fine-grained petal-like microstructure forming at low pO2, and large thin-sheeted crystals for at high pO2; however, MoO2 grows epitaxially on both f-mica and c-sapphire substrates while layered \u03b1-MoO3 grows epitaxially on f- mica but not on sapphire These findings should facilitate the rationale synthesis of MoOx thin films with control over preferred orientation and microstructure to access and tune properties for applications. The research highlights the critical role of control over deposition parameters in tailoring the properties of MoO\u2093 films for applications such as electrochromic coatings and gas sensing."
