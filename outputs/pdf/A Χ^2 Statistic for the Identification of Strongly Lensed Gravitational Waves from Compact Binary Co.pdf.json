These will have identical phase evolution but differing amplitudes. Such lensing signatures are expected to be detected by the end of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra\u2019s (LVK\u2019s) fifth observing run (O5). In this work, we propose a novel \u03c72 lens statistic to segregate pairs of detected GW events as either lensed or unlensed, using templates typically used in GW searches. The statistic is an application of the generalized \u03c72 discriminator described in Dhurandhar et al. [1], tailored to probe the similarity (or lack thereof) between the phase evolutions of two CBC signals. We assess the performance of \u03c72 lens on a realistic astrophysical dataset of lensed and unlensed CBCs detectable in O4, assuming a single LIGO-like detector at design sensitivity. We find that we can correctly identify lensed events with efficiencies comparable to existing Bayesian and machine learning methods. Evaluating \u03c72 lens is orders of magnitude faster than Bayesian methods. Moreover, the statistics of \u03c72 lens, in stationary Gaussian noise, are fully understood, in contrast to machine learning methods. \u03c72 lens can, therefore, be used to rapidly and accurately weed out the vast majority of unlensed candidate pairs and identify lensed pairs.

INTRODUCTION The LIGO-Virgo [2, 3] network of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors has observed \u223c90 compact binary co- alescence (CBC) events in its first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) [4]. Additional events were indepen- dently catalogued in [5\u20139] using the publicly accessible LIGO-Virgo data [10, 11]. The overwhelming majority of these are binary black holes (BBHs). Nevertheless, binary neutron star [12, 13] and neutron star black hole mergers [14] have also been observed. The ongoing O4 is likely to more than triple the number of detections, confirming that GW astronomy has well and truly ar- rived. The detected CBCs have enabled some of the most unique tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong field regime [15]. These include: a residuals test where the best fit GR waveform is subtracted out from the data, and the consistency of the residual with noise is assessed [16\u201318]; an inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test, where source parameters extracted from low and high- frequency parts of the signal, assuming a GR template waveform, are compared [19, 20]; a test that looks for deviations in Post Newtonian coefficients of the GW signal as a means to investigate the consistency of the \u2217sudhir.gholap@iucaa.in \u2020 ksoni01@syr.edu \u2021 shasvath.kapadia@iucaa.in \u00a7 sanjeev@iucaa.in inspiral with GR [21\u201328]; and propagation tests that compare the speed of GWs with the speed of light [29], and look for signatures of velocity dispersion due to a non-zero graviton mass [30]. Gravitational lensing of GWs promises to provide yet another unique test of GR. This phenomenon occurs when GWs encounter large agglomerations of matter. In particular, when GWs from stellar mass CBCs en- counter galaxies or clusters, strong lensing in the geo- metric optics regime will ensue. As a result, multiple temporally resolved copies of the source GW signal will be observed by the GW detector network, with image time delays that span minutes to months for galaxy- scale lenses [31\u201333], and weeks to years for cluster- scale lenses [34\u201338]. These copies will have identi- cal phase evolutions, but differing amplitudes (due to (de)magnification) as well as a constant phase differ- ence of 0, \u03c0/2, or \u03c0 (known as the Morse phase) [39\u201341]. On the other hand, if these GWs encounter lenses, such as intermediate-mass black holes, whose Schwarzchild radii are comparable to the wavelength of the GWs, a single modulated GW image will be produced, exhibit- ing interference, diffraction and beating patterns [42\u2013 49]. Gravitational lensing will enable additional power- ful tests of GR [50\u201354]; provide precise measurements of cosmological parameters [55\u201361]; drastically enhance GW early warning [62]; enable constraints on the frac- tion of dark matter as massive compact halo objects [63, 64], as well as on the mass of the warm dark mat- ter particle [65]; probe properties of the lens such as electric charge [66], and probe the proper motion of iso- arXiv:2502.00844v1 [gr-qc] 2 Feb 2025"
