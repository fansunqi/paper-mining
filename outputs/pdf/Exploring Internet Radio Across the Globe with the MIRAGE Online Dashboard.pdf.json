  "abstract": "This study presents the Music Informatics for Radio Across the GlobE (MIRAGE) online dashboard, which allows users to access, interact with, and export metadata (e.g., artist name, track title) and musicological features (e.g., instrument list, voice type, key/mode) for 1 million events streaming on 10,000 internet radio stations across the globe. Users can search for stations or events according to several criteria, display, analyze, and listen to the selected station/event lists using interactive visualizations that in- clude embedded links to streaming services, and finally ex- port relevant metadata and visualizations for further study. 1. INTRODUCTION Despite its scholarly neglect relative to television, film, and print [1], radio\u2019s convergence with the internet has ex- tended its reach via web browsers and smartphone apps, enabling the medium to persist as a central site of culture and daily life for communities around the world [2,3]. The recent resurgence of pirate and community radio stations on the internet alongside national and multinational net- works also reflects internet radio\u2019s lower production costs relative to short-wave terrestrial (e.g., FM or AM) radio [4], resulting in a diverse range of both standardized and specialized programming [5\u20137]. And yet, the volume and scope of much of the research in fields like radio studies has been freighted heavily to- wards the Global North [1]. In doing so, the research pro- gram just described attempts to situate listeners within a particular musical tradition (e.g., western classical or pop- ular music), rather than within a particular geographic en- vironment (e.g., El Paso, Texas) where myriad musical tra- ditions might co-exist. As a result, music\u2019s vast global mar- ketplace has yet to receive sustained scholarly attention in the MIR community. To address this issue, this study presents the develop- ment release (v0.2) of the Music Informatics for Radio Across the GlobE (MIRAGE) online dashboard, which allows users with potentially little training in computa- tional methods to access, interact with, and export meta- \u00a9 Nguyen et al..

To that end, Section 2 summarizes pre- vious research on the development of digitized music cor- pora and cultural databases. Next, Section 3 presents the MIRAGE-MetaCorpus, Section 4 introduces the MIRAGE online dashboard, and Section 5 offers a potential use case. Finally, Section 6 discusses limitations and future direc- tions for the MIRAGE project. 2. PREVIOUS RESEARCH In recent years, researchers in music theory, music in- formation retrieval (MIR), and radio/media studies have developed digitized music corpora and cultural databases that represent data in machine-readable symbolic and au- dio formats. In computational music theory, heavily curated corpora (100s of songs) like the McGill Billboard and Rolling Stone-200 data sets include expert annotations for musical parameters like harmony, meter, and melody, for example, but remain restricted to Anglophone popular music tradi- tions [8,9]. What is more, the limited size of symbolic cor- pora makes comparative research especially difficult [10]. In MIR, corpora like the Million Song data set address issues of scale while avoiding copyright infringement by providing researchers with publicly available metadata and musicological features protected under fair use for a large collection of songs hosted on commercial music-streaming services like last.fm [11]. Nevertheless, the size, scope, and format of these projects require extensive training in distant-reading (i.e., computational) methods [12\u201314]. As a result, MIR corpora sometimes eschew the kinds of mu- sical engagements favored by scholars in humanities dis- ciplines using close-reading methodologies. Finally, the projects referenced above do not include information about the geographic location of the music encountered by listen- ers in everyday life. Finally, in radio/media studies, researchers routinely employ interview and survey methodologies to explore ra- dio stations across the globe [15, 16], in some cases by selecting samples from radio-station directories hosted on- line [17]. The now defunct ComFM, for example, included a catalogue of web-radio stations classified according to geographic region and type of programming.
