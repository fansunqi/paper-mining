  "abstract": "Menzel1, \u2020 1Institut f\u00a8ur Physik, Otto-von-Guericke-Universit\u00a8at Magdeburg, Universit\u00a8atsplatz 2, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany (Dated: February 11, 2025) In an inspiring recent study, Xu et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 46 (2023)] observed for a living active biofilm under circular confinement two emergent dynamic modes of collective motion in the film. One corresponds to global rotational motion of oscillating sense of rotation, the other one to uniformly translating motion of rotating migration direction. The authors reproduced these features in a discretized theoretical model for elastic active solids. We here demonstrate that the discovered fundamental phenomena are generic and emerge abundantly for a broad range of viscoelastic fluids and solids. Elastic solids represent only one limiting case. Recently, Xu et al. [1] performed a pioneering experi- ment on Proteus mirabilis biofilms. It represents one of the first experimental realizations of living solids for the purpose of studying different types of persistent motion on large collective scales. Corresponding properties of active solids were previously observed mainly from ex- periments on small artificial active robots [2\u20135]. In the considered biofilms, the constituent bacteria are embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix. The lat- ter gives rise to elastic interactions between the individ- uals. Specifically, under circular confinement Xu et al. observe the emergence of two distinct oscillatory global modes of motion. They are selectively excited depending on the activity of the bacteria [1]. While at low activity, the dynamics can be described as an oscillatory rotational motion, at high activity, a translational mode of rotating velocity direction emerges. Because of the elastic contributions to the bacterial interactions resulting from the extracellular matrix, the films were conceived as elastic solids. Accordingly, the- oretical analysis was based on lattice-like configurations of elastically coupled active agents linked by permanently set elastic springs [6, 7]. Since the results are reproduced by the elastic spring-lattice model, the observed proper- ties appear associated with genuinely solid-like behavior. However, it turns out that the behavior discovered by Xu et al. is much more generic. We here show that ul- timate solid-like behavior is not mandatory to observe the described modes of motion. Instead, viscoelastic flu- ids that feature terminal flow instead of elastic arrest likewise display the corresponding behavior. Therefore, the modes of motion discovered by Xu et al. should be characteristic for a broad general class of biological flu- ids, solids, and biomaterials. Active elastic solids only represent one limiting case. To illustrate these conclusions, we apply a recently de- rived, unified description of migrating active units in vis- cous, viscoelastic, or elastic active media on a supporting \u2217henning.reinken@ovgu.de \u2020 a.menzel@ovgu.de substrate [8]. The behavior of the active medium is repre- sented by the dynamics of three continuous fields. First, the polar order parameter field P quantifies the locally averaged polar orientational order of the migration di- rections of the active units. Second, the overall velocity field v couples to the dynamics of P. Third, to take elas- tic properties into account, we capture the deformation history of the system by the displacement field u. As shown in Ref. 8, the basic evolution of P in the simplest case in rescaled units is governed by \u2202tP + v \u00b7 \u2207P = \u2212P + \u22072P + \u2126\u00b7 P + \u03b3av \u00b7 [(2 + P \u00b7 P)I/3 \u2212PP] . (1) The first two terms on the right-hand side reflect orienta- tional and translational diffusion. This equation further includes advection with the flow field v as well as reorien- tation via the vorticity tensor \u2126= [(\u2207v)\u22a4\u2212(\u2207v)], where \u22a4denotes the transpose. Moreover, the active units tend to align with the overall flow, quantified by the align- ment strength \u03b3a. This effect is specific to active units interacting front\u2013rear asymmetrically with a supporting substrate and exposed to displacements of a surrounding medium [9, 10]. Similar terms are included in various particle-resolved models of active solids [4, 11]. Further, I is the unit matrix, and the magnitude of the vector field of polar order is limited to |P| \u22641. The velocity field v is governed by an extended Stokes equation, 0 = \u2212\u2207p + \u03b7\u22072v + \u00b5\u22072u \u2212\u03bdvv \u2212\u03bddu + \u03bdpP . (2) Here, the pressure field p enforces incompressibility, that is, \u2207\u00b7 v = 0. Viscous and elastic force densities are quantified by the viscosity \u03b7 and shear modulus \u00b5, re- spectively, together with the displacement field u. Mo- tion relative to the substrate implies friction and elas- tic restoring forces quantified by \u03bdv and \u03bdd, respectively. They slow down motion and tend to pull material ele- ments back to their initial positions. Active forcing of strength \u03bdp drive the film. The dynamics of the displacement field u is governed by [12] \u2202tu = v \u2212\u03c4 \u22121 d u . (3) arXiv:2502.06312v1 [cond-mat.soft] 10 Feb 2025"
