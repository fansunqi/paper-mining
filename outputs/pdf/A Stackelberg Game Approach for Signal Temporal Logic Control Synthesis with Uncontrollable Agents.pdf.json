  "title": "A Stackelberg Game Approach for Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis with Uncontrollable Agents.pdf",
  "abstract": "\u2014 In this paper, we investigate the control synthesis problem for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in the presence of uncontrollable agents. Existing works mainly address this problem in a robust control setting by assuming the uncontrollable agents are adversarial and accounting for the worst-case scenario. While this approach ensures safety, it can be overly conservative in scenarios where uncontrollable agents have their own objectives that are not entirely opposed to the system\u2019s goals. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a new framework for STL control synthesis within the Stackelberg game setting. Specifically, we assume that the system controller, acting as the leader, first commits to a plan, after which the uncontrollable agents, acting as followers, take a best response based on the committed plan and their own objectives. Our goal is to synthesize a control sequence for the leader such that, for any rational followers producing a best response, the leader\u2019s STL task is guaranteed to be satisfied. We present an effective solution to this problem by transforming it into a single-stage optimization problem and leveraging counter- example guided synthesis techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is sound and identify conditions under which it is optimal. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. I. INTRODUCTION Decision making and task planning are fundamental chal- lenges in the design of autonomous systems. In recent years, formal methods have gained significant attention for high- level task planning due to their ability to provide rigorous specifications and guarantees for system correctness [1]\u2013 [3]. Among these methods, temporal logic has emerged as a particularly expressive tool, enabling the description of complex temporal and spatial constraints in a mathemati- cally rigorous yet user-friendly manner. Particularly, Signal Temporal Logic (STL), initially introduced in [4], has been extensively studied as it is well-suited for capturing spatial- temporal requirements real-valued signals in dynamic and uncertain environments [5]\u2013[7]. In the context of control synthesis for STL specifications, one of the most widely used methods is the optimization- based approach [8], [9]. This approach encodes the satis- faction of STL formulae using binary variables and trans- forms the control synthesis problem into a Mixed Integer This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62061136004, 62173226, 61833012).

An alternative ap- proach leverages control barrier functions, which provide sufficient conditions to characterize forward invariant sets corresponding to the satisfaction regions of STL formulae [10], [11]. These methods primarily address the open-loop control problem, where the goal is to synthesize a single control sequence that satisfies the STL specifications without external disturbances. When external disturbances or uncertainties are present, feedback control based on online information becomes essen- tial. In the context of STL control synthesis, a direct approach is to integrate open-loop trajectory synthesis methods into the framework of receding horizon control; see, e.g., [12]\u2013[18]. This involves solving the optimization problem iteratively in real-time, where only the latest control input is applied at each step. Particularly, to ensure the feasibility of recursive computation, it is necessary to solve a robust optimization problem that guarantees the satisfaction of the STL task under all possible disturbances [17], [19]\u2013[21]. The above-mentioned existing works on STL control syn- thesis in the presence of external inputs essentially fall into the category of zero-sum games. In this framework, the controller aims to ensure the satisfaction of the STL formula under all possible external inputs, which can be interpreted as a second player whose objective is entirely opposed to the system\u2019s STL task. This zero-sum setting is suitable when external inputs are generated by disturbances or adversarial agents. However, in some scenarios, this approach can be overly conservative. For example, consider a two-agent con- trol synthesis problem where only Agent 1 is controllable, and the satisfaction of the STL formula for Agent 1 depends on the joint trajectory of both agents. In the zero-sum setting, the controller must adopt a conservative plan to guarantee task satisfaction regardless of Agent 2\u2019s actions. In practice, however, Agent 2 may have its own objective, which could be described by another STL formula that is not entirely opposed to Agent 1\u2019s goal. In such cases, synthesizing a plan for Agent 1 should take into account the rationality of Agent 2 to reduce conservatism. This essentially requires to consider non-zero sum game setting, where each player has its own distinct objective. Motivated by the above considerations, this paper proposes a new perspective for STL control synthesis in the presence of uncontrollable agents within the framework of Stackelberg game or leader-follower game. In this setting, the system\u2019s inputs are divided into two parts: controlled inputs and uncontrollable inputs. Unlike the traditional robust control or zero-sum game approaches, here we assume that both the arXiv:2502.14585v1 [eess.SY] 20 Feb 2025"
