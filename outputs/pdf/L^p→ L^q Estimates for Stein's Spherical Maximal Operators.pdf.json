In this article we consider a modi\ufb01cation of the Stein\u2019s spherical maximal op- erator of complex order \u03b1 on Rn: M\u03b1 [1,2] f(x) = sup t\u2208[1,2] 1 \u0393(\u03b1) Z |y|\u22641 \u0010 1 \u2212|y|2\u0011\u03b1\u22121 f(x \u2212ty)dy . We show that when n \u22652, suppose \u2225M\u03b1 [1,2] f\u2225Lq(Rn) \u2264C\u2225f\u2225Lp(Rn) holds for some \u03b1 \u2208C, p, q \u22651, then we must have that q \u2265p and Re \u03b1 \u2265\u03c3n(p, q) := max ( 1 p \u2212n q, n + 1 2p \u2212n \u22121 2 1 q + 1 ! , n p \u2212n + 1 ) . Conversely, we show that M\u03b1 [1,2] is bounded from Lp(Rn) to Lq(Rn) provided that q \u2265p and Re \u03b1 > \u03c32(p, q) for n = 2; and Re \u03b1 > max {\u03c3n(p, q), 1/(2p) \u2212(n \u22122)/(2q) \u2212(n \u22121)/4} for n > 2. The range of \u03b1, p and q is almost optimal in the case either n = 2, or \u03b1 = 0, or (p, q) lies in some regions for n > 2. 1. Introduction In 1976 Stein [22] introduced the spherical maximal means M\u03b1 f(x) = supt>0 |M\u03b1 t f(x)| of (complex) order \u03b1 on Rn, where M\u03b1 t f(x) = 1 \u0393(\u03b1) Z |y|\u22641 \u0010 1 \u2212|y|2\u0011\u03b1\u22121 f(x \u2212ty) dy. (1.1) These means are initially de\ufb01ned only for Re \u03b1 > 0, but the de\ufb01nition can be extended to all complex \u03b1 by analytic continuation. In the case \u03b1 = 1, M\u03b1 corresponds to the Hardy- Littlewood maximal operator and in the case \u03b1 = 0, M\u03b1 corresponds to the spherical maximal operator Mf(x) := supt>0 |Mt f(x)| in which Mt f(x) = cn Z Sn\u22121 f(x \u2212ty) d\u03c3(y), x \u2208Rn, (1.2) where Sn\u22121 denotes the standard unit sphere in Rn. In [22] Stein obtained the inequality \u2225M\u03b1 f\u2225Lp(Rn) \u2264C\u2225f\u2225Lp(Rn) (1.3) for Re \u03b1 > 1 \u2212n + n/p when 1 < p \u22642; or Re \u03b1 > (2 \u2212n)/p when 2 \u2264p \u2264\u221e. From it, we see that when \u03b1 = 0 and n \u22653, the maximal operator M is bounded on Lp(Rn) for the range p > n/(n \u22121). This range of p is sharp, as has been pointed out in [22, 24], no such result can hold for p \u2264n/(n \u22121) if n \u22652. The extension of this result in [22] to the case n = 2 was established about a decade later by Bourgain [2], see also the account in [23, Chapter XI]. In addition to Stein and Bourgain, other authors have studied the spherical maximal means; for instance see [10, 11, 13, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 28] and the references therein.
