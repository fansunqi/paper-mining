  "abstract": "In this paper, we successfully establish a Courant-type nodal domain theorem for both the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and the closed eigenvalue problem of the Witten- Laplacian. Moreover, we also characterize the properties of the nodal lines of the eigenfunctions of the Witten-Laplacian on smooth Riemannian 2-manifolds. Besides, for a Riemann surface with genus g, an upper bound for the multiplicity of closed eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian can be provided. 1 Introduction Let (Mn, \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9) be an n-dimensional (n \u22652) complete Riemannian manifold with the metric \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9. Let \u2126\u2286Mn be a domain in Mn, and \u03c6 \u2208C\u221e(Mn) be a smooth1 real-valued function de\ufb01ned on Mn. In this setting, on \u2126, the following elliptic operator \u2206\u03c6 := \u2206\u2212\u27e8\u2207\u03c6, \u2207\u00b7\u27e9 can be well-de\ufb01ned, where \u2207, \u2206are the gradient and the Laplace operators on Mn, respec- tively. The operator \u2206\u03c6 w.r.t. the metric \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9is called the Witten-Laplacian (also called the drifting Laplacian or the weighted Laplacian). The K-dimensional Bakry-\u00b4Emery Ricci curvature RicK \u03c6 on Mn can be de\ufb01ned as follows RicK \u03c6 := Ric + Hess\u03c6 \u2212 d\u03c6 \u2297d\u03c6 K \u2212n \u22121, 0 \u2217Corresponding author MSC 2020: 35P15, 49Jxx, 35J15. Key Words: Witten-Laplacian, Neumann eigenvalues, Laplacian, the free membrane problem, isoperimetric inequalities. 1 In fact, one might see that \u03c6 \u2208C2 is suitable to derive our main conclusions in this paper. However, in order to avoid putting too much attention on discussion for the regularity of \u03c6 and following the assumption on conformal factor e\u2212\u03c6 for the notion of smooth metric measure spaces in many literatures (including of course those cited in this paper), without speci\ufb01cation, we prefer to assume that \u03c6 is smooth on the domain \u2126. 1"
