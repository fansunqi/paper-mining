  "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) has demonstrated their superior- ity in collaborative filtering, where the user-item (U-I) interaction bipartite graph serves as the fundamental data format. However, when graph-structured side information (e.g., multimodal similar- ity graphs or social networks) is integrated into the U-I bipartite graph, existing graph collaborative filtering methods fall short of achieving satisfactory performance. We quantitatively analyze this problem from a spectral perspective. Recall that a bipartite graph possesses a full spectrum within the range of [-1, 1], with the high- est frequency exactly achievable at \u22121 and the lowest frequency at 1; however, we observe as more side information is incorpo- rated, the highest frequency of the augmented adjacency matrix progressively shifts rightward. This spectrum shift phenomenon has caused previous approaches built for the full spectrum [-1, 1] to assign mismatched importance to different frequencies. To this end, we propose Spectrum Shift Correction (dubbed SSC), incorporating shifting and scaling factors to enable spectral GNNs to adapt to the shifted spectrum. Unlike previous paradigms of leveraging side in- formation, which necessitate tailored designs for diverse data types, SSC directly connects traditional graph collaborative filtering with any graph-structured side information. Experiments on social and multimodal recommendation demonstrate the effectiveness of SSC, achieving relative improvements of up to 23% without incurring any additional computational overhead.

It is essential for on- line service providers [2, 6], such as short video platforms and e-commerce websites, to curate and deliver information streams that align closely with user preferences. Hence, recommender sys- tems emerge as the core technology for this purpose. The involved recommendation engine is continuously evolving so as to fully utilize the diverse types of perpetually accumulating data. Among these, interaction data, which records whether a user has previously interacted with an item, serves as the most commonly studied data format [15, 29]. Apart from this fundamental user-item data, there also exist abundant user-user relationships [25, 39] such as friends and colleagues, as well as diverse item multimodal data [13, 44, 46] including textual descriptions and visual thumbnails. This side information serves as valuable complements to interaction data (especially for cold-start users and items [20]) when group prefer- ences and item similarities are accurately extracted. Then a natural research direction arises, i.e., how to utilize interaction and side information together to match with real-world recommendation scenarios. Due to the bipartite graph nature of the user-item interaction data, graph neural networks (GNNs) [9, 19, 35], particularly spectral GNNs [5, 8], prove the superiority of collaborative filtering. For instance, LightGCN [15] and JGCF [10] achieve competitive rec- ommendation performance despite their simplified architectures. However, the models in social or multimodal recommendation tend to exhibit significant complexity when integrating aforementioned side information. Note that in social recommendation the user- user social network is the most crucial side information, while in multimodal collaborative filtering, the additional data is typically preprocessed into item-item similarity graphs [44, 46] based on encoded multimodal features. To fully exploit the derived graph- structured side information, researchers typically develop dedicated modules [17, 43] or auxiliary loss functions [34, 37, 47]. These in- terventions however limit the generalizability of the model to tasks with varying characteristics, statistical properties, and signal-to-noise arXiv:2502.08071v1 [cs.IR] 12 Feb 2025"
