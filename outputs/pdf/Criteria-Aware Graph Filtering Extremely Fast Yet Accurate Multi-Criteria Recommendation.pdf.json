  "abstract": "Multi-criteria (MC) recommender systems, which utilize MC rating information for recommendation, are increasingly widespread in various e-commerce domains. However, the MC recommendation using training-based collaborative filtering, requiring consideration of multiple ratings compared to single-criterion counterparts, often poses practical challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance along with scalable model training. To solve this problem, we pro- pose CA-GF, a training-free MC recommendation method, which is built upon criteria-aware graph filtering for efficient yet accurate MC recommendations. Specifically, first, we construct an item\u2013item similarity graph using an MC user-expansion graph. Next, we de- sign CA-GF composed of the following key components, including 1) criterion-specific graph filtering where the optimal filter for each criterion is found using various types of polynomial low-pass filters and 2) criteria preference-infused aggregation where the smoothed signals from each criterion are aggregated. We demonstrate that CA-GF is (a) efficient: providing the computational efficiency, of- fering the extremely fast runtime of less than 0.2 seconds even on the largest benchmark dataset, (b) accurate: outperforming bench- mark MC recommendation methods, achieving substantial accuracy gains up to 24% compared to the best competitor, and (c) inter- pretable: providing interpretations for the contribution of each criterion to the model prediction based on visualizations.

MC recommender systems generally excel in recommending relevant items to users compared to single-criterion recommender systems, as they capture user preferences more exquisitely [5, 11, 17, 22, 31, 47]. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1a, in a restaurant domain, a user can provide four criteria ratings, which include an overall rating as well as other MC ratings for food, service, and location. Nonetheless, the inclusion of MC ratings in MC recommender systems often significantly increases computational demands com- pared to single-criterion counterparts, due to the complexity of pro- cessing and analyzing multi-dimensional user feedback [18, 42]. For instance, given \ud835\udc41user\u2013item interactions with 8 criteria, training- based collaborative filtering (CF) methods having a computational complexity of \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc412) increase the training time by approximately 64 times over the single-criterion case. As shown in Figure 1b, the time required for identical epochs in training substantially escalates when MC ratings are incorporated into three benchmark deep neu- ral network (DNN)-based MC recommendation methods, including AEMC [31], ExtendedSAE [35], and CPA-LGC [25]. Acknowledging that user preferences evolve quickly due to trends, personal circum- stances, and exposure to new content, such latency in training time may not be desirable [1, 13, 26, 28]. Unlike earlier studies on learning models such as graph convo- lution for recommendations in a parametric manner [7, 8, 40, 41, 46], our study is inspired by recent advances in non-parametric, arXiv:2502.09046v1 [cs.IR] 13 Feb 2025"
