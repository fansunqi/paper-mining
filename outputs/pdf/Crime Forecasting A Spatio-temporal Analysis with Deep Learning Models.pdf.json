  "abstract": "This study uses deep-learning models to predict city partition crime counts on specific days. It helps police enhance surveillance, gather intelligence, and proactively prevent crimes. We formulate crime count prediction as a spatiotemporal sequence challenge, where both input data and prediction targets are spatiotemporal sequences. In order to improve the accuracy of crime forecasting, we introduce a new model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We conducted a comparative analysis to access the effects of various data sequences, including raw and binned data, on the prediction errors of four deep learning forecasting models. Directly inputting raw crime data into the forecasting model causes high prediction errors, making the model unsuitable for real - world use. The findings indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves optimal performance when crime data is categorized into 10 or 5 groups. Data binning can enhance forecasting model performance, but poorly defined intervals may reduce map granularity. Compared to dividing into 5 bins, binning into 10 intervals strikes an optimal balance, preserving data characteristics and surpassing raw data in predictive modelling efficacy. Keywords: crime forecasting; time series data; deep learning; data binning 1. Introduction Although there are many methods to predict crimes, there is no perfect solution to predict where and when crimes may occur, who may commit crimes, and who is most likely to offend or suffer in the future. The occurrence of crimes is difficult to predict, many of which cannot be described quantitatively. Near-repeat victimization (NRV)[1] pertains to an elevated risk of victimization that exhibits trends in spatiotemporal proximity. When a crime takes place at a particular location, there is an increased likelihood that additional crimes will occur in the vicinity within a given time frame. Near-repeat victimization is a fundamental concept in crime forecasting, providing a basis for understanding and predicting crime patterns. Recently, deep learning technology is often used in crime modeling and prediction. Deep learning, ML, and computer vision offer a new way for intelligent surveillance. It mimics human approach, operates 24/7, and repeats tasks consistently once trained[2]. To address the evolving landscape of financial crime[3], group anomaly detection, graph theory, and deep learning are being combined to detect networks of malicious actors among the broader groups of users. By applying data fusion to the ConvBiLSTM model[4], Tam, S. et al. extracted vectors from tweet and crime modalities and merge them into a single representation that captures all-modality information. The study aims to use semantic knowledge from text and crime data, and transfer it to a crime- prediction model to improve its predictive ability with multi-source info. Tariq et al.[5] developed a time series forecasting model utilizing a RNN combined with LSTM to predict daily and monthly violent crime rates in Philadelphia. The integration of LSTM with RNN helps mitigate issues related to gradient explosion and gradient vanishing. Sandagiri et al.[6] proposed a framework for crime prediction, which comprises three main modules: data collection, crime detection, and crime prediction, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model serving as the proposed approach. Tasnim et al. [7] analyzed the crime forecasting problem using deep learning techniques. They proposed a fusion method based Attention-LSTM has Feature Level Fusion and Decision Level Fusion model. Introducing the Transfer learning technique reduced the training time to a certain amount. A variety of spatiotemporal statistical techniques are commonly employed to forecast criminal incidents. Time series and deep learning techniques are useful for crime trend prediction. Incorporating spatial and temporal info in crime datasets boosts the accuracy and reliability of prediction systems[8]. Liang, W. et al.[9] proposed CrimeTensor, a tailored framework. It uses tensor learning with spatiotemporal consistency to predict crime incidents in different categories per target region. Muthamizharasan et al.[10] endeavored to predict crime rates by employing a CNN-LSTM model. In this approach, CNN was utilized to extract features from the dataset, while LSTM was leveraged to analyze the temporal relationships within long-term data. Their findings indicated that the combination of CNN and LSTM yields a robust crime prediction method, achieving high levels of accuracy. Wang and Yuan[11] utilize LSTM to forecast the daily occurrences of criminal events in Atlanta. By using LSTM, they are able to capture the dependencies in the time lag as well as the spatial distribution of these criminal events. In addition, they discuss the effects of different spatiotemporal scales on the accuracy of crime prediction."
