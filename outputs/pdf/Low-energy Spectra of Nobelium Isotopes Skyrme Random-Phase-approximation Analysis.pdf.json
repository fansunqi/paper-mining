QRPA states of multipolarity \u03bb\u00b5=20, 22, 30, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44 and 98 are considered. The main attention is paid to isotopes 252No and 254No, for which the most extensive experimental spectroscopic information is available. In these two nuclei, a reasonable description of K\u03c0 = 8\u2212, 2\u2212and 3+ isomers is obtained with the force SLy6. The disputed 8\u2212isomer in 254No is assigned as neutron two-quasiparticle con\ufb01guration nn[734 \u2191, 613 \u2191]. At the energies 1.2 - 1.4 MeV, the 2qp K-isomers 4\u2212, 7\u2212in 252No and 4\u2212, 6\u2212, 7\u2212in 254No are predicted. In 254No, the K\u03c0 = 3+ isomer should be accompanied by the nearby K\u03c0 = 4+ counterpart. It is shown that, in the chain 250\u2212262No, some features of 252No and 254No exhibit essential irregularities caused by a shell gap in the neutron single-particle spectrum and corresponding breakdown of the neutron pairing. In particular, low-energy pairing-vibrational K\u03c0 = 0+ states in 252,254No are predicted. I. INTRODUCTION Spectroscopy of transfermium nuclei (Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm, No) is presently of a large interest, see reviews [1\u20133] and references therein. These nuclei provide a valuable infor- mation on the single-particle spectra and pairing in heavy nuclei, which in turn can be useful for understanding the features of neighbouring superheavy nuclei. Though experimental spectroscopic information for transfermium nuclei is permanently increasing (see early [4\u20138] and re- cent [9\u201311] experimental studies), it still remains rather scarce. Among transfermium nuclei, nobelium isotopes have, perhaps, the most extensive experimental spectro- scopic data [1, 2, 12]. Among nobelium isotopes, 252No and 254No are most investigated[1, 2]. In these two nuclei, long ground-state rotational bands (up to I\u03c0 = 20+ in 252No and I\u03c0 = 24+ in 254No) are observed. Already for two decades, two- quasiparticle (2qp) K\u03c0 = 8\u2212isomers (at 1.254 MeV in 252No and 1.296 MeV in 254No) are scrutinized by both experiment and theory. Some low-energy rotational bands with band heads K\u03c0 = 2\u2212at 0.929 MeV in 252No and K\u03c0 = 3+ at 0.987 MeV in 254No are found. Quite recently nonrotational states K\u03c0 = 4+ (1.203 MeV) and 0+ (0.888 MeV) in 254No were tentatively observed [10]. The 0+ state was treated as a result of the coupling be- tween \u201dnormal\u201d deformed and superdeformed shapes. While the experimental information on nobelium iso- topes is generally poor, there is already a lot of the- oretical studies and predictions. The quadrupole mo- ments and corresponding quadrupole deformations were estimated, see e.g. [13\u201316]. Single-particle (s-p) spec- tra, moments of inertia and pairing e\ufb00ects were system- atically explored [16] using di\ufb00erent density functional theories (DFT): relativistic covariant [17], Skyrme [18] and Gogny [19]. Various multipole low-energy two- quasiparticle (2qp) excitations were considered in self- consistent calculations with Gogny force [15]. A thorough investigation of s-p spectra, deformations, pairing and \u03b1-decay features in nobelium isotopes was recently per- formed within the symmetry-unrestricted nonrelativis- tic mean-\ufb01eld model employing a shell correction anal- ysis [20]. Further, long rotational bands in 252,254No were in- vestigated within cranked shell model [21\u201323], Skyrme- Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and Lipkin-Nogami methods [24], and interacting-boson model (IBM) [25]. The relation between the lowest 1\u2212states and re\ufb02ec- tion asymmetry in nobelium isotopes was studied [26]. Within the cluster model, the alternative parity bands based on the ground 0+ and vibrational 1\u2212states were predicted as a consequence of the re\ufb02ection asymme- try [27]. The scissor mode was measured [28] and an- alyzed within the Wigner Function Method [29]. K-isomers in 252,254No were also widely explored, see e.g. [4\u20136, 10, 11, 22, 23, 30\u201334]. In particu- lar, two-quasiparticle K-isomers 8\u2212, 2\u2212and 3+ were considered using Woods-Saxon potential and schematic QRPA approach [6, 30, 31]. Within the cranking shell model (Nilsson potential with hexadecapole deformation) + pairing treated with the particle-number projection (CSM+PNP), a nice description of the energy of 8\u2212- isomer in 254No was obtained [33]. In the combined ex- periment + theory (Woods-Saxon potential + pairing) study [6], the complete decay scheme for isomers 8\u2212was suggested (though being further disputed in a later ex- periment [10, 11]). Using the two-center shell model, \u03b1- decays relevant for the K-isomers were explored [32]. In pairing blocking and QRPA calculations [31], low-energy states with K\u03c0 = 0\u2212, 1\u2212, 2\u2212, 3+, 8\u2212were considered; for 2\u2212, 3+, 8\u2212states in 252,254No, a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained.
