  "abstract": "Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of pho- tons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intrigu- ing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting be- tween a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the ex- citon and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes ex- cited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe2. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dis- persion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission. Introduction Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical research efforts based on their potential for light-driven energy harvesting. From the many semiconducting materials exhibiting excitonic resonances, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) have garnered special interest in recent years since they exhibit excitons with large 1 arXiv:2502.03361v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 6 Feb 2025"
