  "abstract": "However, the 64-core RISC-V Sophon SG2042 is a potential game changer as it provides a commodity available CPU with much higher core count than existing technologies. In this work we benchmark the SG2042 CPU hosted in an experimental, dual-socket, system to explore the performance properties of the CPU when running a common HPC benchmark suite across sockets. Earlier benchmarks found that, on the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, whilst the SG2042 performs well for compute bound codes, it struggles when pressure is placed on the memory subsystem. The performance results reported here confirm that, even on a different system, these memory performance limitations are still present and hence inherent in the CPU. However, a multi-socket configuration does enable the CPU to scale to a larger number of threads which, in the main, delivers an improvement in performance and-so this is a realistic system configuration for the HPC community.

Indeed, in late 2024 Nvidia announced that there were multiple RISC-V cores in each of their GPUs, however, for all these successes RISC-V has yet to gain widespread traction as a main-line technology in High Performance Computing (HPC). As the HPC community moves further into the exascale era, and there is increased focus on sustainability, the community must tackle the challenge around how to deliver both increased performance and greater energy efficiency. Consequently, there are opportunities for technologies such as RISC-V, where vendors can more easily integrate specialisations, to fill an important role in HPC. A common criticism from the HPC community about RISC-V is that there is a lack of real-world high performance hardware available to build systems around. A major step forwards was therefore in summer 2023 when Sophon announced the SG2042, which is the first high core count commodity available RISC-V CPU. Containing 64-cores, the SG2042 RISC-V CPU is aimed at high performance workloads and consequently this is a far more serious proposition for the HPC community than previous RISC-V hardware. Previous work [3] found that whilst each core of the SG2042 was a considerable improvement beyond other existing RISC-V hardware, the CPU struggled to match the performance of x86-based CPUs that are commonplace in HPC. However, from this previous work it was not possible to understand whether the issues that were observed were inherent to CPU itself or the rest of the system, the Milk-V Pioneer. The Pioneer is a designed as a workstation and-so there could be limitations more generally around the memory subsystem that then impact the performance observed when running codes on this system. In this paper we build on previous benchmarking work to revisit previously run benchmarks on a bespoke dual-socket SG2042 based system developed by E4 Computer Engineering SPA. Comparing against previous published results, we compare and contrast the insights gained previously against the observed performance on the E4 system. This paper is structured as follows; after describing the background to this work in Section 2, we then explore the performance across the two sockets on two different nodes in Section ?? of the test system to understand how consistent performance is across socket.
