  "title": "Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection Vision and Challenges.pdf",
  "abstract": "As data continues to grow in volume and com- plexity across domains such as finance, manufac- turing, and healthcare, effective anomaly detec- tion is essential for identifying irregular patterns that may signal critical issues. Recently, foun- dation models (FMs) have emerged as a power- ful tool for advancing anomaly detection. They have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in enhancing anomaly identification, generating de- tailed data descriptions, and providing visual expla- nations. This survey presents the first comprehen- sive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as en- coders, detectors, or interpreters. We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges in leveraging FMs for im- proved anomaly detection. We also outline future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. 1 Introduction Anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the process of identifying patterns or events in data that sig- nificantly deviate from expected behavior [Chandola et al., 2009]. This process is vital across various fields, including finance [Park, 2024], manufacturing [Gu et al., 2024], and healthcare [Moor et al., 2023]. Traditionally, classical meth- ods like k-nearest neighbors and clustering algorithms have been employed for this purpose. However, recent advance- ments in machine learning, such as deep learning, one-class classification, self-supervised learning, and generative adver- sarial networks, have revolutionized this field. These modern techniques have proved extremely successful in detecting or even predicting anomalies from normal data, making them the primary approaches of anomaly analysis in a wide range of applications. Foundation models (FMs) are a class of large-scale, pre- trained machine learning models that are trained on massive, diverse datasets using self-supervised or unsupervised learn- ing [Bommasani et al., 2021]. In recent years, they have shown impressive performance in learning a wide range of representations and tasks, such as translation, summarization, and question answering, with notable examples including in- clude GPT-4 [Achiam et al., 2023], Gemini [Team et al., 2023] and CLIP [Radford et al., 2021]. Trained on exten- sive and diverse datasets, FMs comprise a large number of parameters that enable them to capture intricate patterns and subtle nuances within data. This ability to model such com- plexity makes them particularly well-suited for anomaly de- tection, where identifying deviations from normal behavior is essential. FMs offer several advantages for anomaly detection, driven by advancements in computational hardware, model architec- tures, and access to large-scale training data. A key advan- tage is their capacity for in-context learning, which enables seamless adaptation to entirely new anomaly detection tasks using only natural language instructions [Bakumenko et al., 2024]. This eliminates the need for extensive task-specific training for real-world applications, enabling a more flexible and efficient approach. Additionally, many modern FMs inte- grate multiple data modalities [Lu et al., 2022], such as text, images, and time-series data, which is crucial for detecting anomalies in complex scenarios involving diverse data types. For instance, multimodal models such as Gato [Reed et al., 2022], can perform tasks ranging from image captioning to robotic control, exemplifying the potential of such models as generalist agents. Furthermore, the application of FMs in anomaly detection can enhance explainability, a critical re- quirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, where understanding the rationale behind detected anomalies is critical. FMs are increasingly being applied to anomaly detection tasks. However, systematic reviews that thoroughly exam- ine and depict this field are still limited. While some works have explored the use of LLMs for anomaly detection and have made initial attempts to formalize the research land- scape, few provide a comprehensive summary of current progress or address the key challenges in this area. For in- stance, [Su et al., 2024] reviews the application of LLMs in forecasting and anomaly detection but does not provide a taxonomy specifically tailored to show how FMs are ap- plied to anomaly detection tasks. Similarly, [Xu and Ding, 2024] focuses on anomaly and out-of-distribution detection arXiv:2502.06911v1 [cs.LG] 10 Feb 2025"
