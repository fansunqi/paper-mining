  "title": "Unveiling the Largest Structures in the Nearby Universe Discovery of the Quipu Superstructure.pdf",
  "abstract": "For a precise determination of cosmological parameters we need to understand the effects of the local large-scale structure of the Universe on the measurements. They include modifications of the cosmic microwave background, distortions of sky images by large- scale gravitational lensing, and the influence of large-scale streaming motions on measurements of the Hubble constant. The streaming motions, for example, originate from mass concentrations with distances up to 250 Mpc. In this paper we provide the first all-sky assessment of the largest structures at distances between 130 and 250 Mpc and discuss their observational consequences, using X-ray galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution. Among the five most prominent superstructures found, the largest has a length longer than 400 Mpc with an estimated mass of about 2\u00d71017 M\u2299. This entity, which we named Quipu, is the largest cosmic structure discovered to date. These superstructures contain about 45% of the galaxy clusters, 30% of the galaxies, 25% of the matter, and occupy a volume fraction of 13%, thus constituting a major part of the Universe. The galaxy density is enhanced in the environment of superstructures out to larger distances from the nearest member clusters compared to the outskirts of clusters in the field. We find superstructures with similar properties in simulations based on \u039bCDM cosmology models. We show that the superstructures should produce a modification on the cosmic microwave background through the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect. Searching for this effect in the Planck data we found a signal of the expected strength, however, with low significance. Characterising these superstructures is also important for astrophysical research, for example the study of the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution as well as for precision tests of cosmological models.

Introduction Large efforts have been invested in the study of the cosmic large- scale structure with a main motivation to test cosmological mod- els. The majority of these studies describe the large-scale struc- ture only in a statistical way (e.g. Groth & Peebles 1977; Fry & Peebles 1980). But it is also interesting to map the large-scale structure and to describe the individual properties of the struc- tural elements. This was a particularly hot topic when the topol- ogy of the cosmic web was discovered (e.g. J\u00f5eveer et al. 1978; Oort 1983; de Lapparent et al. 1986). An interesting, modern approach in this field is at present constraint reconstructions of the matter distribution in the local Universe (e.g. Hoffman et al. 2015; Jasche & Lavaux 2019; Dolag et al. 2023; Lilow et al. 2024). In addition, astrophysical processes, such as galaxy forma- tion and evolution, depend on environmental parameters. It is therefore necessary to be able to characterise the large-scale physical environment of a survey field. The early discovery of the morphological segregation of galaxy types on supercluster scales by Giovanelli et al. (1986) illustrates this topic. Last but not least the density and streaming flow structure of the local Universe has an influence on the measurement of cosmological parameters; for example a local underdensity leads to slightly larger local Hubble constant compared to the cosmic mean (e.g. Marra et al. 2013; B\u00f6hringer et al. 2020). The local matter distri- bution also affects the cosmic microwave background via the in- tegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (e.g. Crittenden et al. 1996). There- fore the mapping of the large-scale matter distribution is an im- portant task for observational cosmology. The universe out to a redshift of z \u223c0.03 has been well stud- ied over the entire sky since many years (see e.g. B\u00f6hringer & Chon 2021 and references therein). It is, for example, well cov- ered by the 2MASS redshift survey (Huchra et al. 2012; Bilicki et al. 2014; Macri et al. 2019) and by the Cosmic Flow pecu- liar velocity compilations (e.g. Tully et al. 2016, 2019; Courtois et al. 2023). In this paper we present an all-sky study of the re- gion between z = 0.03 \u22120.06 using galaxy clusters as tracers of the large-scale matter distribution. Galaxy clusters trace the large-scale matter distribution in a true and slightly amplified, biased, way. In order to apply this to map the density distribution of the nearby Universe and to find the largest structures, a comprehensive, statistically highly complete galaxy cluster sample is required with a well- understood selection function. Our CLASSIX cluster survey, based on the cluster detection in X-rays in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (Truemper 1993), providing an almost all-sky coverage, fulfils these requirements. It comprises the REFLEX cluster sur- vey in the South (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2004, 2013) and the NORAS Article number, page 1 of 14 arXiv:2501.19236v1 [astro-ph.CO] 31 Jan 2025"
