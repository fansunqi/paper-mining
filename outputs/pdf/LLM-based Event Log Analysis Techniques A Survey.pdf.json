  "title": "LLM-based Event Log Analysis Techniques A Survey.pdf",
  "abstract": "Event log analysis is an important task that security professionals un- dertake. Event logs record key information on activities that occur on computing devices, and due to the substantial number of events gener- ated, they consume a large amount of time and resources to analyse. This demanding and repetitive task is also prone to errors. To address these concerns, researchers have developed automated techniques to improve the event log analysis process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have re- cently demonstrated the ability to successfully perform a wide range of tasks that individuals would usually partake in, to high standards, and at a pace and degree of complexity that outperform humans. Due to this, re- searchers are rapidly investigating the use of LLMs for event log analysis. This includes \ufb01ne-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and in-context learning, which a\ufb00ect performance. These works demonstrate good progress, yet there is a need to understand the developing body of knowledge, identify commonalities between works, and identify key chal- lenges and potential solutions to further developments in this domain. This paper aims to survey LLM-based event log analysis techniques, pro- viding readers with an in-depth overview of the domain, gaps identi\ufb01ed in previous research, and concluding with potential avenues to explore in future. 1 Introduction This paper provides an overview of developments, up to the time of writing, in the research \ufb01eld of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform event log analysis. Event logging is used to record events that occur in various systems and are of varying types, including system, application, and network logs [38]. Performing log analysis is necessary as it provides insight into how systems are performing and threats to optimal performance. If issues are found, then secu- rity professionals can address them. However, because of the signi\ufb01cant number of events being generated, they require a large amount of time to analyse. In addition, since security professionals perform the task regularly, they can su\ufb00er 1"
