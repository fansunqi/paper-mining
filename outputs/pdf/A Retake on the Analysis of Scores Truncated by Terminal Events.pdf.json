  "title": "A Retake on the Analysis of Scores Truncated by Terminal Events.pdf",
  "abstract": "Analysis of data from randomized controlled trials in vulnerable populations requires special attention when assessing treatment effect by a score measuring, e.g., disease stage or activity together with onset of prevalent terminal events. In reality, it is impossible to disentangle a disease score from the terminal event, since the score is not clinically meaningful after this event. In this work, we propose to assess treatment interventions simultaneously on disease score and the terminal event. Our proposal is based on a natural data-generating mechanism respecting that a disease score does not exist beyond the terminal event. We use modern semi-parametric statistical methods to provide robust and efficient estimation of the risk of terminal event and expected disease score conditional on no terminal event at a pre-specified landmark time. We also use the simultaneous asymptotic behavior of our estimators to develop a powerful closed testing procedure for confirmatory assessment of treatment effect on both onset of terminal event and level of disease score. A simulation study mimicking a large-scale outcome trial in chronic kidney patients as well as an analysis of that trial is provided to assess performance. Key Words: randomized trial, causal inference, terminal event, truncation 1 Introduction Clinical scores of organ conditions or physical ability are not meaningful beyond events such as organ replacement therapy or death. Consequently, in trials where such terminal events are prevalent, this should be reflected by statistical methods that target the impact of the treatment intervention on disease scores. A number of established strategies have been developed to address truncation of measurements due to death or another terminal event. These fall into three broad categories: 1: Evaluate treatment effect in a scenario where you imagine you can intervene to prevent any terminal events prior to time of evaluation. 2: Evaluate treatment effect assigning a worst possible value to initially planned measurements beyond the terminal event. 3: Evaluate treatment effect conditional on no terminal event. The first strategy employs assumptions to predict how measurements post terminal events would behave had the terminal events not occurred. That is, it treats measurements truncated by 1 arXiv:2502.03942v3 [stat.ME] 10 Feb 2025"
