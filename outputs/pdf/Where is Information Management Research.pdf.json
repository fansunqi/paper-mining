  "abstract": ". We report on a preliminary investigation into the current scope of research in information management, adopting a conceptual approach derived from previous work by Hj\u00f8rland in information science and by Palvia in infor- mation systems. We created a data-set of 107 articles resulting from a search in Web of Science, using the search strategy of the term information management in the titles of articles, and then restricting the analysis to those journals we identified as having an information science orientation, rather than an infor- mation systems orientation. The analysis reveals the International Journal of Information Management as the most significant journal in the field, but also draws attention to the rise of interest in the field through contributions to two Brazilian journals and one Spanish journal. The thematic analysis revealed that the dominant research themes from the information science perspective were empirical user studies, studies of the structural and institutional approach, and information system usage and adoption. Further work will be undertaken to ex- plore the relevance of the approach in the analysis of other document sets from areas such as health care, construction and engineering. Keywords: Information Management, Literature Review, Content Analysis, 2004-2019. 1 Introduction There have been previous attempts to identify the nature of information management; first, a paper that dealt with the creation of a curriculum for the subject [18], and then a further review [8], which was updated for publication in a collection of papers in 2004 [9], as well as a very computer-oriented analysis by Targowski [15]. Clearly, over the past fifteen years, many technological developments have taken place that are changing the nature of information management: cloud computing, big data, ma- chine learning, social media, and further developments in mobile computing involv- ing 4G and 5G and the worldwide spread of the smartphone. Over the same period, some of the earlier issues in information management will have assumed lesser signif- icance and others will have been resolved. Consequently, our research objective here is to determine how the research field of information management has changed over the past fifteen years, in response to the changes that have taken place in the business and research environments. This paper is restricted to an analysis of the information- science-related papers on information management from journals that we identified as having an information science perspective on the subject. We intend to continue the analysis in the future by analyzing journals from other fields, in which information management articles can be found, e.g. health research journals. There also have been calls to explore the information management research area more rigorously from the perspective of conceptual approaches [10; 17].
