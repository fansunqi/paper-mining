  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a uni\ufb01ed approach to establish the uniqueness of generalized conformal restriction measures with central charge c \u2208(0, 1] in both chordal and radial cases, by relating these measures to the Brownian loop soup. Our method also applies to the uniqueness of the Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov loop measures for c \u2208(0, 1], which was recently obtained in [Bavarez- Jego, arXiv:2407.09080] for all c \u22641 through deep algebraic structures of SLE loop measures. In contrast, though only valid for c \u2208(0, 1], our proof is signi\ufb01cantly simpler, as it directly links natural quantities of MKS measures to loop-soup observables. 1 Introduction In the study of Brownian intersection exponents, Lawler and Werner [LW00] \ufb01rst realized that any conformally invariant process satisfying a certain restriction property would give rise to the same intersection exponents as the Brownian motion. This idea, combined with Schramm\u2019s discovery of SLE process [Sch00], \ufb01nally led to the rigorous determination of the Brownian intersection expo- nents [LSW01a, LSW01b, LSW02b, LSW02a]. To further deepen this idea, Lawler, Schramm and Werner [LSW03] gave a complete understanding of the conformal restriction measures in the chordal case (which corresponds to De\ufb01nition 1.1 with c = 0 below). In particular, they showed that the boundary of conformal restriction samples can be described by variants of SLE8/3. Conformal restric- tion measures in other cases are also studied in [Wu15, Qia18]. For general SLE\u03ba with \u03ba \u2208(0, 4], there is a corresponding parameter c \u22641 called central charge related to it via c(\u03ba) = 1 \u22126 \u0012 2 \u221a\u03ba \u2212 \u221a\u03ba 2 \u00132 , (1.1) such that SLE\u03ba and its variants satisfy a generalized conformal restriction property that involves the Brownian loop mass with the corresponding c; see e.g. [LSW03, Dub05, Law09, WW13, Qia21]. For c \u2208(0, 1], corresponding to \u03ba \u2208(8 3, 4], there is another simple way to obtain a generalized restriction sample by taking the \ufb01lled union of a standard one with all loop-soup clusters it intersects from an \u2217caigefei1917@pku.edu.cn; Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University \u2020yifangao@cityu.edu.hk; City University of Hong Kong 1"
