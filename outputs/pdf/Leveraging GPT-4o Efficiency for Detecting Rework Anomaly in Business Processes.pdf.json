  "title": "Leveraging GPT-4o Efficiency for Detecting Rework Anomaly in Business Processes.pdf",
  "abstract": ". This paper investigates the effectiveness of GPT-4o-2024- 08-06, one of the Large Language Models (LLM) from OpenAI, in de- tecting business process anomalies, with a focus on rework anomalies. In our study, we developed a GPT-4o-based tool capable of transform- ing event logs into a structured format and identifying reworked activ- ities within business event logs. The analysis was performed on a syn- thetic dataset designed to contain rework anomalies but free of loops. To evaluate the anomaly detection capabilities of GPT-4o-2024-08-06, we used three prompting techniques: zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot. These techniques were tested on different anomaly distributions, namely normal, uniform, and exponential, to identify the most effective approach for each case. The results demonstrate the strong performance of GPT- 4o-2024-08-06. On our dataset, the model achieved 96.14% accuracy with one-shot prompting for the normal distribution, 97.94% accuracy with few-shot prompting for the uniform distribution, and 74.21% accuracy with few-shot prompting for the exponential distribution. These results highlight the model\u2019s potential as a reliable tool for detecting rework anomalies in event logs and how anomaly distribution and prompting strategy influence the model\u2019s performance.

Tra- ditional approaches have made significant progress, but face inherent limitations that reduce their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. For example, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used to exploit object-centric event logs for anomaly detection [4], they struggle to detect temporal order anomalies and of- ten rely on complex graph structures that may not fully capture the conceptual connections between activities [6]. Conformance checking techniques excels at de- tecting control flow anomalies in Business Process Management (BPM), such as parallel execution or sequence rule violations, but struggles to incorporate mul- tidimensional aspects such as resource usage or performance metrics [28].
