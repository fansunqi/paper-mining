  "abstract": "While the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies, like cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have brought convenience and productivity improvements, they have also introduced new challenges in training and education that require the reskilling of existing employees and the building of a new workforce. Exacerbated by the already existing workforce shortages, this mammoth workforce reskilling and building effort aims to build a high-tech workforce capable of operating and maintaining these 4IR systems; requiring a higher student retention and persistence. This increase in student retention and persistence will be especially critical when training the workforce originating from marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), where challenges arise due to lack of access to high-quality education throughout the trainee\u2019s formative years (pre/middle/high schools), creating a cyclic set of knowledge dependencies that are difficult to meet. To address these challenges, this research presents Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0 (gAI-PT4I4), a framework that focuses on personalization of 4IR experiential learning, using sentiment analysis to gauge student\u2019s knowledge comprehension, while using a combination of generative AI and finite automaton to personalize the content to the students\u2019 learning needs. The framework administers experiential learning, using low-fidelity Digital Twins that enable virtual reality-based (VR) training exercises focusing on 4IR training. The VR environment, integrates a generative AI teaching assistant called the Interactive Tutor, that guides the student through the training exercises, with audio and text communications. The gAI-PT4I4 uses these audio/text communications between the tutor and the trainee to perform sentiment analysis using a novel zero-shot learning pipeline, that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), with prompt engineering to evaluate student sentiments in teacher-student conversations without any prior training (unlike traditional deep learning techniques). Our experimental evaluation shows this zero shot sentiment analysis pipeline built on GPT4 has an 86% accuracy while classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. The gAI-PT4I4, explores the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), for grounded generation of personalized learning content using domain specific knowledge in combination with LLMs to provide personalized teaching in real-time. Lastly the gAI-PT4I4, uses finite automaton to split each exercise in different states of varying difficulty, requiring 80% student task-performance accuracy, to dynamically increase the difficulty of the exercise by transitioning through the automaton. Experimental evaluation with a group of 22 volunteers showed the participant skills improvement from an accuracy to over 80%, with reduction in training time. Lastly, this paper also presents a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, that presents a scalable framework to map Digital Twin functionalities with different education levels, mapping Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, and the Kirkpatrick\u2019s model with levels of Digitial Twin complexity.

INTRODUCTION T HE rapid adoption of automation in cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as smart manufacturing plants, is transforming the world and driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). These 4IR systems rely on critical technologies like cloud computing, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and universal network connectivity to achieve increased produc- tivity and sustainable growth with agile and responsive supply chains [1], [2], [3]. While these technologies bring significant benefits, their growing adoption has also increased the complexity of manufacturing systems, making them increasingly difficult to manage, secure, and optimize. These transformative changes make it critical for the 4IR workforce to have a strong understanding of topics in 4IR, requiring reskilling of the existing workforce in addition to training a new workforce, a mammoth task on scale [4]. However, such engineering training programs face multiple obstacles. For instance, although online training programs are cost-effective, easy to scale, and are preferred for reskilling/upskilling efforts [5], 4IR workforce training requires access to specialized hardware, making such programs unsuitable for online offerings. Furthermore, the current labor shortages [6] will require new workforce creation programs or reskilling/upskilling programs to have higher student retention arXiv:2502.14080v1 [cs.CY] 19 Feb 2025"
