  "abstract": "Extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems composed of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs, 0.1 \u22120.3 M\u2299) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 103 \u2212105 M\u2299) are ideal objects for multi-messenger astronomy because they produce both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals. Both relativistic effects and the mass transfer (MT) process are important for determining orbital dynamics, but the current model has not taken these ingredients fully into account. Here we use a perturbed Keplerian framework and the post-Newtonian (PN) formalism to model the relativistic orbit of a WD around a spinning IMBH. We pay special attention to the dynamical evolution during a narrow phase near the orbital pericenter where the WD fills the Roche lobe and starts MT. We find that gravitational radiation and MT have opposing effects on orbital evolution. When MT predominates, the orbital period and eccentricity could may increase, sometimes enabling the WD to escape and avoid tidal disruption. Additionally, we estimate the time required for the GW phase to shift by one radian due to the MT process and identify cases where this phase shift will be detectable by future GW observations. The temporal expansion of the orbit during MT offers a potential explanation for the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) found in several X-ray transients, highlighting the importance of including both the relativistic and MT processes in the WD-IMBH model.

EMRIs are important sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) (Barack & Cutler 2004; Gair 2009; Berry & Gair 2012; Gair et al. 2017; Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017). Their GW signals contain rich information about the formation and evolution of stars around MBHs (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2007; Amaro-Seoane 2018), and they also offer a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the strong-gravity regime (Barsanti et al. 2024; Speri 2024). Among the various types of EMRIs, WDs inspiraling towards intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 103 \u2212105M\u2299) stand out as \u2605E-mail: yangyang24@stu.pku.edu.cn \u2020 E-mail: yangjiev@lzu.edu.cn \u2021 E-mail: xian.chen@pku.edu.cn \u00a7 E-mail: zhangzihan242@mails.ucas.ac.cn a special type, not only because their formation channel was recog- nized relatively early (Hils & Bender 1995; Freitag 2001; Bogdanovi\u0107 et al. 2014), but also because the end products are luminous electro- magnetic (EM) flares from the tidal disruption of the WDs by the IMBHs (Luminet & Pichon 1989; Ivanov, P. B. & Papaloizou, J. C. B. 2007; Zalamea et al. 2010). Such EM counterparts associated with GW signals could enable precise measurements of the geometry of the universe (Menou et al. 2008; Sesana et al. 2008). King (2020) suggested that quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), a type of X-ray transient recently discovered (e.g. Miniutti et al. 2019; Giustini, Margherita et al. 2020; Arcodia et al. 2021; Chakraborty et al. 2021; Arcodia, R. et al. 2022; Miniutti, G. et al. 2023a,b; Arco- dia, R. et al. 2024; Giustini, Margherita et al. 2024), are produced by WD-IMBH systems. Alternative models, such as star-disk collisions, also exist (Xian et al. 2021; Franchini, Alessia et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024a,c; Chakraborty et al. 2024). The sharpness of each burst and the average time between consecutive eruptions are well explained by the repeated partial disruption of the smaller compact object (or a main-sequence star) by the IMBH (King 2022; Chen et al. 2022; Zhao, Z. Y. et al. 2022; Krolik & Linial 2022; Wang et al. 2022; Lu & Quataert 2023; Linial & Sari 2023; Garain & Sarkar 2024). However, not all the observational properties of QPEs have been \u00a9 2025 The Authors arXiv:2502.06160v1 [astro-ph.HE] 10 Feb 2025"
