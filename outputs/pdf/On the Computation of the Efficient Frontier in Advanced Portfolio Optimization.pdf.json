  "abstract": "In this work, we deal with the problem of computing a comprehensive front of efficient solutions in multi-objective portfolio optimization problems in presence of sparsity constraints. We start the discussion pointing out some weaknesses of the classical scalarization approach when applied to the considered class of prob- lems. We are then motivated to propose a suitable algorithmic framework that is designed to overcome these limitations: the novel algorithm combines a gradient- based exploration-refinement strategy with a tailored initialization scheme based on memetic or multi-start descent procedures. Thorough computational experi- ments highlight how the proposed method is far superior to both scalarization and popular genetic algorithms. Keywords: Portfolio optimization; multi-objective problems; sparsity constraints; scalarization; Pareto front reconstruction. MSC Classification: 90C29 , 90C26 , 90B50 , 91G10 1 Introduction Portfolio selection has undoubtedly constituted one of the most attractive and studied problems in decision science, given its relevance to the finance community.
