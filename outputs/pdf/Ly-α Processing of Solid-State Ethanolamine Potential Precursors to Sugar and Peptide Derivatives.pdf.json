  "abstract": "Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study inves- tigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-\u03b1 (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be (4.7 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221218 cm2, providing insight into its half-life of 6.5 \u00d7 107 yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up pro- cess following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.

INTRODUCTION In the cold and dense environments of interstellar molecular clouds, gas-phase molecules accumulate on dust grains, forming ice layers. Cosmic rays penetrate these clouds, and UV photons produced by hydrogen excited by cosmic rays can enhance the chemical com- plexity of the existing ices. This environment promotes the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) from simpler compounds that form on grain surfaces and evolve within the clouds. In recent years, the ever so sensitive James Webb Space Telescope has helped to observe the chemical complexity in these regions in the solid state (McClure et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2024; Rocha et al. 2024). Recently, ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, or EA) was detected in the interstellar medium within the molecular Corresponding author: Tushar Suhasaria suhasaria@mpia.de cloud G+0.693-0.027 in the Sagittarius B2 complex at the Galactic Center. Reported by Rivilla et al. (2021), this detection was achieved through rotational transition observations and suggests that EA may form through gas-grain chemistry. Although EA has been observed only in the gas phase and not within interstellar ices, it is hypothesized that its presence results from the erosion of icy mantles by low-velocity shocks in massive molecular clouds (Rivilla et al. 2021). EA has also been found in the Almahata Sitta meteorite (Glavin et al. 2010). In a recent study, we concluded that the detection of EA ice would be very challenging based on the estimation of an upper limit abundance in the solid state (Suhasaria et al. 2024). EA, an aminoalcohol containing both amino (NH2) and hydroxyl (OH) groups, is significant due to its po- tential role in the origin of life. As the simplest phospho- lipid head group, EA, also known as \u03b2-aminoethanol or glycinol, serves a precursor to glycine in prebiotic chem- istry in simulated archean alkaline hydrothermal vents (Zhang et al. 2017). It is also a component of various arXiv:2502.07970v1 [astro-ph.GA] 11 Feb 2025"
