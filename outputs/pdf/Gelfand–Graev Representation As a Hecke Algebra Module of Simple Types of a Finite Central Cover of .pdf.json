  "abstract": ". For an n-fold Kazhdan\u2013Patterson cover or Savin\u2019s cover of a general linear group over a non-archimedean local \ufb01eld of residual characteristic p with gcd(n, p) = 1, we realize the Gelfand\u2013Graev representation as a Hecke algebra module of a simple type and study its explicit expression. As a main corollary, we calculate the Whittaker dimension of every discrete series representation of such a cover. Using Zelevinsky\u2019s classi\ufb01cation, this theoretically gives the Whittaker dimension of every irreducible representation. Contents 1. Introduction 2 1.1. Background 2 1.2.
