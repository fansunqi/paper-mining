  "abstract": "The real-time Railway Traffic Management Prob- lem (rtRTMP) is a challenging optimisation prob- lem in railway transportation. It involves the effi- cient management of train movements while min- imising delay propagation caused by unforeseen perturbations due to, e.g, temporary speed limita- tions or signal failures. This paper re-frames the rtRTMP as a multi-agent coordination problem and formalises it as a Distributed Constraint Optimisa- tion Problem (DCOP) to explore its potential for decentralised solutions. We propose a novel coor- dination algorithm that extends the widely known Distributed Stochastic Algorithm (DSA), allowing trains to self-organise and resolve scheduling con- flicts. The performance of our algorithm is com- pared to a classical DSA through extensive simu- lations on a synthetic dataset reproducing diverse problem configurations. Results show that our ap- proach achieves significant improvements in solu- tion quality and convergence speed, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in managing large- scale railway networks. Beyond the railway do- main, this framework can have broader applicabil- ity in autonomous systems, such as self-driving ve- hicles or inter-satellite coordination. 1 Introduction In the realm of railway transportation, the real-time Rail- way Traffic Management Problem (rtRTMP) [Qu et al., 2015; Pellegrini et al., 2015] is the problem of efficiently coordi- nating train movements across a railway network to counter- act possible knock-on delays caused by traffic perturbations such as train malfunctions, signal failures, or temporary speed limitations. Knock-on delays are due to conflicts, that re- quire external intervention on train paths through rerouting or rescheduling. Traditionally, such interventions have relied on centralised decision-making by human dispatchers, often with limited computational support, and primarily guided by personal experience. In the academic literature, centralised approaches domi- nate, employing methods such as Integer Linear Program- ming (ILP) [Caimi et al., 2012; Meng and Zhou, 2014; Toletti et al., 2020], Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) [Luan et al., 2020; Fischetti and Monaci, 2017; Pellegrini et al., 2015; T\u00a8ornquist and Persson, 2007; Lu et al., 2022; Reynolds and Maher, 2022; Leutwiler et al., 2023], and graph-based formulations [Corman et al., 2010; Lamorgese and Mannino, 2015; Mascis and Pacciarelli, 2002; Sam`a et al., 2017; Bettinelli et al., 2017; Rodriguez, 2007]. However, centralised approaches struggle to scale with in- creasing network sizes due to computational constraints. These constraints may be overcome by developing decen- tralised approaches, where decision-making is distributed across individual trains acting as autonomous agents [Mar- celli and Pellegrini, 2020]. Decentralisation potentially scales better to large-scale area networks, possibly at the cost of accepting non-optimal but still effective solutions. One possible approach to the de- centralised rtRTMP (dec-rtRTMP), presented by [Van Thie- len et al., 2019], focuses on resolving conflicts individually by adjusting train schedules or routes. In contrast, [Shang et al., 2018] suggest empowering trains to make individ- ual decisions, optimizing their movements based on obser- vations of preceding trains. Another proposal by [Yong et al., 2017] introduces swarm intelligence, organizing trains into groups to address common conflicts collectively. In addi- tion, several methods from Artificial Intelligence (AI) have gained attention in this domain, especially following the re- cent developments in deep neural architectures [Jusup et al., 2021]. For instance, [Khadilkar, 2019] advocates for rein- forcement learning (RL), where agents learn from past ex- periences to make decisions. The Flatland challenges, initi- ated by European railway managers, have spurred research in this direction [Mohanty et al., 2020], offering a simpli- fied railway simulator for testing different machine learning (ML) approaches. However, deploying learning algorithms in such complex environment can be challenging and the lack of guarantees on the feasibility of the obtained solution together with the black-box nature of these approaches, makes them difficult to accept by stakeholders. An alternative approach consists in merging optimisation- based planning with self-organisation [D\u2019Amato et al., 2024]. In this approach, individual trains need to agree on possi- ble schedules resulting from local optimisation by interacting with neighbours. [D\u2019Amato et al., 2024] proved the viability of the deployment to real world scenarios of such an hybrid arXiv:2502.08324v1 [cs.MA] 12 Feb 2025"
