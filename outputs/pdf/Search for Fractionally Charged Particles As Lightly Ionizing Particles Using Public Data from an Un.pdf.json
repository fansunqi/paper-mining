In this letter, rela- tivistic FCPs are examined as lightly ionizing particles in underground direct detection on the basis of electron recoil data from XENON-nT. For FCPs from supernova shocks, the best results are ob- tained via direct detection, excluding the FCP charge of \u00003.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u22121.0 \u00d7 10\u22122\u0001 \u00b7e corresponding to an FCP mass of 1 keV\u2013556 GeV. For FCPs from general sources, the best limit is achieved, which is far ahead of other results in almost the entire parameter space, by excluding the FCP flux of \u00004.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u22124.0 \u00d7 10\u221216\u0001 cm\u22122\u00b7 s\u22121\u00b7 sr\u22121 corresponding to the FCP charge of \u00001 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u22121 \u0001 \u00b7 e. Introduction. In 1909, Millikan obtained a precision measurement of the charge of an isolated ion and denoted the test value of an elementary charge as e [1, 2]. How- ever, electric charge quantization is currently a mystery that is unexplained by the standard model (SM) of par- ticle physics. In 1969, McCusker and Cairns reported a track in a delayed-expansion Wilson cloud chamber pro- duced by a fractionally charged particle (FCP, denoted \u201c\u03c7\u201d; also known as a \u201cmilli- or minicharged particle\u201d) in an air-shower core [3]. Moreover, some difficult prob- lems, such as dark matter (DM) [4] and neutrino oscilla- tions [5, 6], suggest that there must be some new physics beyond the SM. Some researchers have made great efforts to study un- confined and free FCPs (in contrast to the quark\u2019s bound state) to extend the SM. Finding FCPs is helpful in test- ing some popular hypotheses, such as DM [7\u201310] and string theory [9, 11, 12], as well expanding the SM. In this work, we search for FCPs as lightly ionizing particles (LIPs) with 1.16 ton\u00b7year exposure data obtained from the XENON-nT experiment [13] and update the limit on their parameter space. Note that it is currently difficult to determine whether these FCPs are generated in the atmosphere or in outer space. Thus, we search for incident FCPs from general sources (including the atmosphere, the Sun and so on) in the view of the detector and mark them with the sub- script \u201cgen\u201d. Some studies have also attempted to gen- erate FCPs via SM particle interactions in nuclear reac- tors [14, 15] and accelerators [16, 17]. In addition, FCPs in dark cosmic rays can be produced through supernova shock (SNS) and accelerated by the Fermi mechanism. Then, they can undergo radiative cooling, Coulomb scattering and energy redistribution during transport [18\u201321]. Finally, they reach the Earth, and their flux in the unit of (GeV\u22121 \u00b7 cm\u22122 \u00b7 s\u22121 \u00b7 sr\u22121) can be estimated via Eq. 1, which is derived from a com- parison with protons [22]. d\u03d5\u03c7 dE\u03c7 SNS \u224830 \u00b7 f 1.7 \u03c7 \u00b7 m\u22121 \u03c7 \u00b7 E\u22122.7 \u03c7 (1) where m\u03c7 is the FCP mass in units of GeV; E\u03c7 is the FCP energy in units of GeV; f\u03c7 is defined as f\u03c7 \u2261Q\u03c7/e; Q\u03c7 is the charge carried by an FCP; and 0 < f\u03c7 < 1. When E\u03c7 < \u00001018 \u00b7 f\u03c7 \u0001 eV, the anisotropy of the FCP flux is not obvious. Impliedly, local DM density is 4.1 GeV/cm\u22123, and the enrichment factor of FCP is 4. FCP signal When FCPs reach the detector in direct detection experiments, there is a probability of interac- tion with the target atoms, resulting in a recoil energy of Er for the atom electrons. The differential event rate of the interaction between FCPs and atoms in the detector is given by Eq. 2. dRr dEr SNS = \u03c1A \u00b7 Z Emax Emin d\u03c3\u03c7A dEr \u00b7 d\u03d5\u03c7 dE\u03c7 \u00b7 dE\u03c7 (2) where \u03c1A is the number density of the target atoms and d\u03c3\u03c7A dEr is the differential cross-section between the FCP and the atom. The number density of xenon atoms is \u03c1A = 4.58 \u00d7 1027 ton\u22121, and d\u03c3\u03c7A dEr is estimated with the equivalent photon approximation [23, 24], as shown in Eq. 3. Focusing on the relativistic FCPs from the SNS, we set Emin = (10 \u00b7 m\u03c7) and Emax = \u0000106 \u00b7 f\u03c7 \u0001 GeV. d\u03c3\u03c7A dEr SNS = f 2 \u03c7 \u00b7 2\u03b1 \u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c3\u03b3(Er) Er \u00b7 ln \u0012 E\u03c7 m\u03c7 \u0013 (3) arXiv:2502.02894v1 [hep-ex] 5 Feb 2025"
