  "abstract": "These materials offer a perfect trifecta: non-toxic elemental composition, exceptional phase stability, and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, unlocking their full potential for solar cell applications requires advanced strategies to fine-tune their electronic and op- tical behavior. In this study, we take CaHfS3\u2014a promising but underexplored candidate\u2014and rev- olutionize its performance by introducing targeted substitutions: Ti at the cation site and Se at the anion site. Using cutting-edge computational techniques, including density functional theory, GW calculations, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we reveal how these substitutions transform the material\u2019s properties. Our findings highlight that alloyed compounds such as CaHfS3\u2212xSex and CaHf1\u2212yTiyX3 (X = S, Se) are not only phase-stable but also feature adjustable direct G0W0@PBE bandgaps (1.29\u20132.67 eV), reduced exciton binding energies, and significantly improved polaron mo- bility. These modifications enable better light absorption, reduced electron-hole recombination, longer exciton lifetimes, and enhanced quantum yield. Impressively, the alloyed perovskites, specif- ically, for the Ti-rich Se-based perovskites, achieve a spectroscopic-limited maximum efficiency of up to 28.06%, outperforming traditional lead-based halide perovskites. Our results demonstrate that strategic alloying is a powerful tool to supercharge the optoelectronic properties of lead-free chalcogenide perovskites, positioning them as strong contenders for next-generation photovoltaic technologies. I. INTRODUCTION: Inorganic\u2212organic halide perovskites (IOHPs) have garnered unparalleled attention over the past decade due to their exceptional electronic and optical properties [1\u20134]. Consequently, the popularity of IOHPs in solar cell research has skyrocketed in recent years, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing dramatically from 3.8% to 26.7% [1, 5]. Despite these advances, a critical challenge persists: the majority of IOHPs are lead (Pb)-based, raising serious concerns about toxicity. Additionally, issues such as degradability, along with thermal and chemical instability attributed to the organic components, present formidable barriers to their large-scale industrial deployment [6, 7]. These challenges have driven research toward designing stable, nontoxic alternative perovskites, paving the way for new, efficient photovoltaic materials. Recently, chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) materials have garnered significant attention as promising alternatives to lead-based perovskites for solar cell technology [8\u201311]. The chemical formula of CPs is represented as ABX3 [11, 12], where A and B correspond to divalent alkali-earth metal cations (Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) and tetravalent transition metal cations (Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+), respectively. The X site is typically occupied by a chalcogen anion such as S2\u2212or Se2\u2212. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have successfully demonstrated the synthesis of CPs, revealing their fascinating and promising properties [8\u201311, 13\u201315]. Also, at ambient temperature, two distinct phases of CPs have been identified: a needle-like orthorhombic phase (NH4CdCl3-type) and a distorted orthorhombic structure (GdFeO3- type). Despite their structural differences, both phases share the same space group, Pnma (No. 62) [11]. Among these CPs, ABS3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; B = Zr, Hf) have been experimentally synthesized with distorted structures featuring corner-sharing BS6 octahedra connected in a three-dimensional network [15]. Also, a distorted CaTiS3 CP has been recently synthesized experimentally, exhibiting a bandgap of 1.59 eV [16]. In addition, several first-principles-based studies have predicted that ABX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; B = Zr, Hf and X = S, Se) CPs exhibit promising electronic and optical properties, making them attractive for optoelectronic applications [14, 17, 18]. How- ever, the performance of ABS3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; B = Zr, Hf) CPs in photovoltaic applications is significantly hindered compared to conventional lead-based HPs [19\u201325], due to their higher bandgaps (1.83\u22122.46 eV), large exciton binding energies (0.19\u22120.26 eV), lower charge carrier mobilities (6.84\u221218.77 cm2V\u22121s\u22121), and reduced PCE (10.56\u221225.02%) [14, 15, 17]. Another study shows that selenide-based CPs outperform sulfur-based CPs in photovoltaic properties \u2217sa731@snu.edu.in, priya.johari@snu.edu.in arXiv:2502.14622v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 20 Feb 2025"
