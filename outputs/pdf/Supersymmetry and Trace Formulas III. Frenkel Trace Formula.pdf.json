  "abstract": ". By applying the new supersymmetric localization principle intro- duced in [4, 5], we present two complementary approaches for the path integral derivation of the \u2018non-chiral\u2019 trace formula for a semisimple compact Lie group G, which generalizes the so-called Frenkel trace formula. Corresponding physi- cal systems for each picture are the quantum mechanical sigma model on G and the gauged sigma model on G\u00d7G, and the approaches closely follow the spirit of the Eskin trace formula [4] and the Selberg trace formula [5] respectively. These methods provide a natural conceptual bridge between two seemingly independent derivations in [4] and [5]. Contents 1. Introduction 1 1.1. Acknowledgments 4 2.

Introduction In [4, 5], we initiated the path integral study of classical trace formulas by for- mulating a new supersymmetric localization principle. It was applied to the Eskin trace formula [8], which deals with the spectrum of the Laplacian on compact Lie groups, and to the Selberg trace formula [14], which deals with the spectrum of the Laplacian on weakly symmetric Riemannian spaces. Although the main ideas, as articulated in [4, 5], were the same, the physical models and observables used were quite di\ufb00erent. Thus in case of the Eskin trace formula, we used a supersymmetric non-linear sigma model on G and the supertrace with fermionic zero modes inserted as a natural observable, while in case of the Selberg trace formula, we used a supersymmetric gauged sigma model on a quotient of a group manifold by a discrete subgroup, and a natural observable was a singular line operator with fermionic zero modes attached. In the present paper, we consider a \u2018non-chiral\u2019 generalization of the Eskin trace formula for a general semisimple compact Lie group G, the so-called Frenkel trace formula. The methods used for its derivation naturally bridge our approaches in [4] and [5]. 1"
