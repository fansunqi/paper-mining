This study 14 proposes a practical method for rapid near-isothermal gas expansion, facilitating efficient heat 15 engines without sacrificing power. The method involves bubble expansion in a heat transfer 16 liquid, ensuring efficient and near-isothermal heat exchange. The mixture is accelerated through 17 a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy. A novel organic 18 vapor cycle employing isothermal expansion utilizing these nozzles is suggested to harness low- 19 grade heat sources. Nozzle experiments with air and water yielded a polytropic index <1.052, 20 enabling up to 71% more work extraction than adiabatic expansion. Simulations on a small-scale 21 heat engine indicate that utilizing these nozzles for thrust generation enables decreasing heat 22 transfer irreversibilities in the cycle, consequently resulting in up to 19% higher power output 23 than the organic Rankine cycle using Pentane. This work paves the way for an efficient and 24 high-power heat-to-power solution. 25 1 arXiv:2502.11082v1 [physics.app-ph] 16 Feb 2025"
