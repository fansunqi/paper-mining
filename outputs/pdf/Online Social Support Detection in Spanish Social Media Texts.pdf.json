  "title": "Online Social Support Detection in Spanish Social Media Texts.pdf",
  "abstract": "The advent of social media has transformed communication, enabling individuals to share their experiences, seek support, and participate in diverse discussions. While extensive research has focused on identifying harmful content like hate speech, the recog- nition and promotion of positive and supportive interactions remain largely unexplored. This study proposes an innovative approach to detecting online social support in Spanish-language social media texts. We introduce the first annotated dataset specifically cre- ated for this task, comprising 3,189 YouTube comments classified as supportive or non-supportive. To address data imbalance, we employed GPT-4o to generate paraphrased comments and create a balanced dataset. We then evaluated social support classification using traditional machine learning models, deep learning architectures, and transformer-based models, including GPT-4o, but only on the unbalanced dataset. Subsequently, we utilized a transformer model to compare the performance between the balanced and unbalanced datasets. Our findings indicate that the balanced dataset yielded improved results for Task 2 (Individual and Group) and Task 3 (Nation, Other, LGBTQ, Black Community, Women, Religion), whereas GPT-4o performed best for Task 1 (Social Support and Non-Support). This study highlights the significance of fostering a supportive online environment and lays the groundwork for future research in automated social support detection.

Introduction Social support is usually conceptualized as an emotional, in- tangible and tangible aid procured from one\u2019s social connec- tions, whereby the person feels loved, cared for, respected, and valued. A plethora of research has established the idea that so- cial support is beneficial and greatly enhances both psycholog- ical and physical well-being, acting as an important factor of protection (Xia et al., 2012), significantly reducing the risk of mortality, with an impact comparable to factors such as obesity or inactivity (Kent de Grey et al., 2018). Social support is positively related to psychological and physical health (Bellinia et al., 2019). Recent studies rightly point out that its functions are vast especially as highly devel- oped social networks can reduce risks and help solve major medical problems (Kent de Grey et al., 2018). Additionally, social support has been associated with fewer symptoms of de- pression, anxiety, and stress (Baeza-Rivera et al., 2022). For the last few years, social media has rapidly grown as an aid to help establish good relations and dialogue among fam- ily, friends and other acquaintances. Nonetheless, this growth has not been without some disadvantages. Its unregulated na- ture sometimes causes online environment that is hostile. Fre- quently, they are used for spreading hate speech and posting offensive comments which have varied negative effects on the society (Abdelsamie et al., 2024). Thus, it is necessary to de- sign strategies that will help notice such kinds of content with \u2217These authors contributed equally to this work. 1Corresponding author: (mshahikit2022@cic.ipn.mx) a view for creating safer digital spaces as well as promoting decent conduct over the internet. Despite the impact it can have on people\u2019s well-being, the promotion of positive and supportive content has not received much attention in this area of research. In response to these challenges, our proposed approach offers a disjunct but under- explored strategy for combating negativity on social media plat- forms by promoting support comments. Instead of focusing ef- forts on detecting and filtering negative content, our approach seeks to cultivate a more positive and supportive online envi- ronment by encouraging users to provide emotional comfort, encouragement, and advice to those facing challenges. Online social support refers to the emotional aid and consola- tion given via digital platforms such as social media. This kind of support is very important for individuals and groups that in- teract on social networks and face different challenges like vic- tims of war, marginalized communities, minority populations etc. Digital platforms make it possible for users to connect with others who share similar experiences. That way they can get necessary resources, help, empathy, courage or encouragement they need. Online support networks are usually vital because they allow for anonymity and accessibility to people who do not have access to conventional supportive systems. They also enable real time participation which encourages a sense of be- longingness, hence fostering psychological well-being by min- imizing negativity effects towards the user. The current study is based on the influence of social support on individual\u2019s health.
