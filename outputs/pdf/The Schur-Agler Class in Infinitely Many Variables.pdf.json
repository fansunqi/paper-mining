  "abstract": ". We de\ufb01ne the Schur-Agler class in in\ufb01nite variables to consist of functions whose restrictions to \ufb01nite dimensional polydisks belong to the Schur-Agler class. We show that a natural generalization of an Agler decomposition holds and the functions possess transfer function realizations that allow us to extend the functions to the unit ball of \u2113\u221e. We also give a Pick interpolation type theorem which displays a subtle di\ufb00erence with \ufb01nitely many variables. Finally, we make a brief connection to Dirichlet series derived from the Schur-Agler class in in\ufb01nite variables via the Bohr correspondence. 1. Introduction This article is about establishing basic properties of the Schur-Agler class in in\ufb01nitely many variables. To back up a bit, the Schur class in N variables, SN, will refer to the set of analytic functions f : DN \u2192D where DN is the N dimensional unit polydisk DN = {z = (z1, . . . , zN) \u2208CN : \u2200j, |zj| < 1}. The Schur class, S\u221e, in in\ufb01nitely many variables will refer to holomorphic functions (meaning complex Fr\u00b4echet di\ufb00erentiable) on Ball(\u2113\u221e) that are bounded by one in supremum norm. (We review standard notations in Section 2.) A remarkable result, attributed to Hilbert, is that if we are given Schur class functions fN \u2208SN for each N, and if for N > M we have fN(z1, . . . , zM, 0, . . . , 0) \u2261fM(z1, . . . , zM), then there exists a holomorphic function f : Ball(c0) \u2192D such that f(z1, . . . , zN, 0, . . . ) = fN(z1, . . . , zN) and such that f is continuous in the norm topology on Ball(c0). See [14], Theorem 2.21 for details. Even more, f has a homogeneous expansion f(z) = \u221e X m=0 Pm(z) where each Pm is an m-homogeneous form on c0 (see [14], Proposition 2.28). Davie-Gamelin [12] proved that f and its homogeneous expansion extends further to Ball(\u2113\u221e). This ex- tension (called the Aron-Berner extension) is somewhat elaborate as it requires passing to the symmetric m-multilinear form associated to each Pm, extending to \u2113\u221eand then proving that the extended homogeneous expansion converges in Ball(\u2113\u221e).
