  "abstract": "Online, visual artists have more places than ever to routinely share their creative work and connect with other artists. These interac- tions support the routine enactment of creative identity in artists and provide inspirational opportunities for artists. As creative work shifts online, interactions between artists and routines around how these artists get inspired to do creative work are mediated by and through the logics of the online platforms where they take place. In an interview study of 22 artists, this paper explores the interplay between the development of artists\u2019 creative identities and the, at times, contradictory practices they have around getting inspired. We find platforms which support the disciplined practice of creative work while supporting spontaneous moments of inspiration, play an increasing role in passive approaches to searching for inspira- tion, and foster numerous small community spaces for artists to negotiate their creative identities. We discuss how platforms can better support and embed mechanisms for inspiration into their infrastructures into their design and platform policy.

These online spaces are not always good for artists, however, as their presence on these This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

As the communicative norms of platforms are embedded into platform design and policies, many artists find themselves being nudged toward a kind of homogeneity, or \"influencer creep\" during their routine interactions with these platforms [6]. Despite the challenging landscape of these online creative spaces that are increasingly mediating people\u2019s routine cre- ative experiences and identities, the infrastructures of these spaces allow for the routine enactment and realization of people\u2019s creative goals and artistic expression [68]. There is less discussion, however, about the interplay of the routines around getting inspired, creative practice, and the enactment of creative identity on these platforms. HCI researchers have long been interested in art and creative work; exploring DIY, maker and craft communities of practice [2, 20, 25, 40, 74] as both a subject as well as a means of research inquiry [26, 60]. Another line of inquiry focuses on creative tool development - where the focus is on augmenting creative prac- tice at various stages of the creative process [24, 37, 41, 76]. While many of these tools are targeted at assisting in the ideation process (e.g., brainstorming with digital mood boards [47, 76]), considerably fewer focus on the process of inspiration as it ties to the enactment of an artist\u2019s creative identity. Ideation, an interactive process that is sometimes collaborative with human or non-human entities [46], does not occupy the same space in the creative process as inspira- tion. Inspiration is an enhancement of cognitive functions, such as divergent thinking or concept blending, that leads to increased idea generation [15]. One must be inspired to ideate, and ideation without inspiration is challenging. Inspiration breathes life into, as well as animates, the mind to produce new ideas that would not otherwise come about [38] - it is the action that comes before the creative practice [35], and, as Weber suggests, inspiration occurs when it pleases, not so much when it pleases us [77]. Doing creative work relies on a variety of routine practices; re- peated and recognizable patterns of interdependent action carried out by multiple actors [21, 55]. While some scholars argue that routines and creativity are diametrically opposed [1], others sug- gest that routines allow the possibility of the enactment of novel, creative ideas [22, 69]. An integral routine of creative work in- volves the often contradictory practices of getting inspired. This paper draws on Hymer\u2019s [38] contradictions of inspiration, as a useful lens through which to interpret the routine processes and practices of inspiration. In these, one must be disciplined in one\u2019s creative practice, but also spontaneous enough to react to a chance encounter with something inspirational; where one must be mind- ful the inspirational potential of one\u2019s surroundings, but still able to mindlessly engage with various spaces for chance encounters with inspirational objects; and how one must actively search for arXiv:2502.07999v1 [cs.HC] 11 Feb 2025"
