  "abstract": ". Threat modelling is the process of identifying potential vulnerabilities in a system and prioritising them. Existing threat modelling tools focus primarily on technical systems and are not as well suited to interpersonal threats. In this paper, we discuss traditional threat modelling methods and their shortcomings, and propose a new threat modelling framework (HARMS) to identify non-technical and human factors harms. We also cover a case study of applying HARMS when it comes to IoT devices such as smart speakers with virtual assistants.

Threat modelling is the process of pre-emptively identifying and prioritising possible threats to a system or service. This process is structured using frameworks such as CIA and STRIDE to identify threats across a range of categories, often supplemented with a model such as DREAD to prioritise the interventions and mitigations. Existing threat modelling tools are primarily designed around technical systems. For example, applying STRIDE to a forum website may identify: users must be authenticated to prevent spoo\ufb01ng others; the site and database should be protected against tampering by hackers; users must be connected to posts through repudiation in case of harmful behaviours; personal information must be protected from disclosure; the site must avoid downtime from DDoS; and users must be distinct from moderators to prevent privilege escalation. Threat modelling can also be used for o\ufb04ine systems such as securing a bicycle: while a user may intuitively identify theft as a risk, CIA would invite them to consider the con\ufb01dentiality of the owner\u2019s current location, the integrity of the bike frame and cables, or the availability of a bike with another person\u2019s lock attached. While e\ufb00ective at evaluating the security threats in these traditional scenarios, threat modelling tools are not as well suited to interpersonal threats in scenarios such as domestic abuse.
